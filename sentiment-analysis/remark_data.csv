Can you hear me?
Martin Viecha
Yes, we can.
"
1,TSLA,2022,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"OK.
Thank you.
Firstly, it sounds like your 1.8 million unit volume indication for this year is somewhat more supply constrained than demand-constrained.
Then I have a follow-up on cost.
Is that an accurate statement?
"
2,TSLA,2022,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"Yes.
And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the 4680 ramp, the Berlin, Austin, Giga things, processes, not at rate.
Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter? And then, lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from -- on where battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night? If I'm correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else, maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity.
"
3,TSLA,2022,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,3,
4,TSLA,2022,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Hi.
Elon, first question is, is it time for Tesla to significantly expand the captive finco? I mean, you only have like $4.5 billion of receivables.
It's basically nothing compared to other big auto companies.
And then, I have a follow-up.
"
5,TSLA,2022,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Thanks, Elon.
And just a follow-up.
I don't want to steal thunder from March 1 down in Austin, but how close are we to that step-change improvement in BOM cost where you could sell an EV for under $25,000 or $30,000 and actually generate a profit, that kind of real moving assembly line moment in manufacturing? Again, I don't want to steal the thunder, but just if you wanted to kind of wrap up with thoughts there, that would be helpful.

Thanks, Martin.
First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4.
It was no small feat.
Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
As far as where we stand, in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install.
Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Next investor question is, Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
Is that still the current plan? Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
"
8,TSLA,2022,4,andrew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,1,"Yes.
I mean, the goals we've outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I mean, that's been a key focus of ours, and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.
"
9,TSLA,2022,4,andrew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,2,"I was going to say, we're also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the 3, Y fleet.
And we're gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we didn't know we had out of the product.
So over the course of 2023, on the powertrain side, we're actually going to go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need or we have more content than we need without impacting reliability at all.
And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of 2023.
So we're not just sort of relying on supply.
We're also doing design actions to bring cost out.
"
10,TSLA,2022,4,andrew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,3,"Yes.
"
11,TSLA,2022,4,andrew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,4,"I mean, you're right.
Not all of the 100 gigawatt-hours are going to go into the Semi trucks.
That is correct.
"
12,TSLA,2022,4,andrew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,5,
13,TSLA,2022,4,alex-potter,piper-sandler,True,0,"Do you hear me, guys?
Martin Viecha
Yes.
"
14,TSLA,2022,4,alex-potter,piper-sandler,True,1,"OK, great.
So a quick one on FSD.
This is, I guess, for Zach.
Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD.
But was wondering if you're able to disclose the percentage of the $15,000 price that you're not going to be able to recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred.
"
15,TSLA,2022,4,alex-potter,piper-sandler,True,2,"OK.
Great.
And then, maybe one additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you're planning.
It's a lot of batteries, basically, and presumably, you won't be putting all of those in Tesla Semi.
So I guess two questions about that incremental capacity.
First, is it correct to assume that all of those 4680s are going to be more or less fungible and usable in your entire range of products? And if the answer is yes, then if you had to guess, how do you think that 100 gigawatt-hours would be allocated between your various end markets?
"
16,TSLA,2022,4,alex-potter,piper-sandler,True,3,
17,TSLA,2022,4,george-gianarikas,canaccord-genuity,True,0,"Hi, everyone.
Thanks for taking my question.
So you recently adjusted prices, and that may have put many of your competitors in the back foot.
In addition to that, capital markets have recently gotten a lot tougher.
So with those factors in mind, I'm curious how you see the current competitive landscape changing over the next few years.
And who do you see as your chief competitors five years from now?
"
18,TSLA,2022,4,george-gianarikas,canaccord-genuity,True,1,"Just as a follow-up, the Inflation Reduction Act has created huge tax incentives for commercial vehicles.
You mentioned an incredibly interesting product pipeline.
Are there maybe some plans to accelerate commercial vehicle form factors outside of the Tesla Semi to help accelerate EV adoption?

20,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,0,"Thank you, Martin.
So '22 -- just going through the '22 recap.
It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
It was our best year ever on every level.
Team did an amazing job.
It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
So in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow.
Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records while -- despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates and many delivery challenges.
So it's worth noting that all these records were in the face of massive difficulties.
Credit to the team for achieving that.
The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand.
Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
So I mean, that -- it's hard to say whether that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.
And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.
So we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
So basically, price really matters.
I think there's just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car but can't afford it.
And so, these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
And sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is.
And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible so I'm glad that we're able to do so.
And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered.
We're also making very good progress on cost control.
And we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yes.
With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America.
This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.
And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways.
And our published data shows that improvement in safety -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear.
So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers.
So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low cost and high energy density.
So energy storage also saw record growth, and that is continuing to accelerate.
That's always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind, because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time.
So you have those three things.
You can convert all of earth to a fully sustainable situation many times over, actually.
So I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and we -- our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible.
So yes, so we were ramping up Megapack production.
And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our legal output.
So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best operating margins.
As we mentioned many times before, we want to be the best manufacturer.
But really, manufacturing technology will be our most important long-term strength.
And we'll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1 investor day.
And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year.
Congratulations, guys.
Martin Viecha
Thanks, Elon.
And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
"
21,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,1,"We already answered that question.
Martin Viecha
Yes, exactly.
"
22,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,2,"Yes.
And so, there are two really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas.
So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost -- or insurance costs even when they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the gigas of the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas.
So it's great.
So it has an amplified effect, very important.
Then it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas for all Teslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing a Tesla if it's in a collision and for Tesla Insurance.
And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into that because the other insurance companies would cover the cost.
And actually, the cost, in some cases, were unreasonably high.
So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving for active safety, active collision prevention.
So it's giving us this really good feedback for, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's car is in an accident -- most accidents are actually small.
They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
And we're making -- just to emphasize another key point because some of these points might be less, so I apologize for being repetitive.
But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part -- providing spare parts needed for collision repair have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
So if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car.
It's extremely expensive.
And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
So this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for midyear?
"
23,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,3,"We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer.
But I always like try to downplay the start of production because the start of production is always very slow.
It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first.
So I wouldn't put too much thought in start of production.
It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
"
24,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,4,"Yes, exactly.
Martin Viecha
And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage, where should Tesla build the next Megapack factories? How many are needed on each continent?
"
25,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,5,"It's a good question.
It's not something we -- I think we'll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we're thinking about very carefully.
But really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production.
And you'll see announcements come out later this year and next that answer that question.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
OK.
And now let's go to analyst questions.
The first analyst question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
Rod, feel free to unmute your mic.
"
26,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,6,"Well -- OK.
I mean, our internal production potential is actually closer to 2 million vehicles, but we were saying 1.8 million because, I don't know, there just always seems to be some freaking force majeure thing that happens somewhere on earth.
And we don't control if there's like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, etc.
So if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year.
We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential.
So -- and I think there would be demand for that, too.
"
27,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,7,"I don't think we want to say the specific number, but it's interesting, if you look at the size of the -- of Giga Nevada that is allocated to make 100 gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about 35.
"
28,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,8,"Yes.
And it goes back to the point I was making.
I said it several years ago, I think Tesla's really the competitive strength that will be, by far, the hardest for other companies to replicate is Tesla being just d*** good at manufacturing and having the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world.
And if you've got that sort of advanced manufacturing toolbox, you can apply it to many things and we're applying it now to battery cells.
I should also say that there -- we have other products in development.
We're not going to announce them, obviously, but they're very exciting.
And I think it will blow people's minds when they -- when we reveal them.
Tesla has the most exciting product road map of any company on earth by a long shot.
And we'll continue to, I think, be in that position.
We've got more great ideas.
I mean, we know what to do here.
So the future is very exciting.
As I said in the last call, there's going to be bumps along the way and we'll probably have a pretty difficult recession this year, probably.
I hope not, but probably.
And so, one can't predict the short-term sort of stock value because when there's a recession and people panic in the stock market, then prices of stocks -- well, the value of stocks can drop sometimes to surprisingly low levels.
But long term, I am convinced that Tesla will be the most valuable company on earth.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And I think, Zach, there was a question on cost headwind in Q4.
"
29,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,9,"My guess is if the recession is a serious one, and I think it probably will be but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
I'm just guessing here.
So this is -- that would be my guess.
"
30,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,10,"The trend is very strong toward use of FSD.
And as you alluded to, the -- with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases.
And so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don't quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world's leading AI companies.
This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side.
With the Hardware 3 inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at this point, five years old from the design point.
And with Hardware 4 coming and then Hardware 5 beyond that where there are significant leaps.
And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year.
And we're seeing just a lot of world-class AI talent join the company.
There's also the long-term potential of Optimus where we're able to use our expertise in electric motors and power electronics, batteries and advanced manufacturing to be able to make a humanoid robot that is actually useful and can be made at high volume with exceptional capabilities because of the autopilot AI that -- where we take the -- because the car is like a robot on four wheels and Optimus is a robot on legs.
But the -- as we get closer and closer to solving real-world AI, and we don't see anyone even close to us in achieving this, the value -- I think you appreciate this and a few others do, but most don't know what I'm talking about.
And so -- but it's -- this is the thing that has order of magnitude, potential market cap improvement for Tesla.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
"
31,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,11,"I don't know.
This is a bit too much guessing at this point.
"
32,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,12,"Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The second question is in similar vein.
What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels? We've answered that one as well.
So let's go to the next one.
The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells/packs, so $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour, for autos and energy products? And how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
"
33,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,13,"But -- yes.
Yes.
"
34,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,14,"I alluded to a number of future products.
Those future products would use the 4680.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the next question comes from George from Canaccord Research.
"
35,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,15,"Five years is a long time.
As with the Tesla order part, AI team, until late last night, and just we're asking [Inaudible], so who do we think is close to Tesla with -- a general solution for self-driving? And we still don't even know really who would even be a distant second.
So yes, it really seems like we're -- I mean, right now, I don't think you could see a second place with a telescope, at least we can't.
So that won't last forever.
So in five years, I don't know, probably somebody has figured it out.
I don't think it's any of the car companies that we're aware of.
But I'm just guessing that someone might figure it out eventually.
So yes.
"
36,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,16,"Yes.
And I don't want to say like -- I think we have a lot of respect for the car companies in China.
They are the most competitive in the world.
That is our experience.
And the Chinese market is the most competitive.
They work the hardest and they work the smartest.
That's -- so a lot of respect for the China car companies that we're competing against.
And so, if I would have guessed, there are probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.
We are -- our Tesla China team is winning in China.
And I think we actually are able to attract the best talent in China.
So hopefully, that continues.
So yes, so we're fired up about the future, and yes, well, it's going to be great.
"
37,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,17,"Well, I was basically saying that, yes, but I'm not going to give you details because this is -- nice try, nice try.
Yes, of course, of course.
So -- we actually always look at like, what is the limiting factor for new vehicles? Because if the -- for the longest time, we've been constrained on total cell lithium-ion production output.
And so, people said, like, why not bring this other car to market or that other car to market? Well, it doesn't really help if all you're doing is shuffling around the batteries from one car to another.
In fact, it hurts because you add complexity but you don't add incremental volume.
So it's sort of pointless, in fact, like counterproductive to add model complexity without solving the availability of lithium-ion batteries.
So as we get -- so we want new product introduction to match where the cells are available or that new product to use those cells without cannibalizing the cells of the other cars.
That's the actual limiting factor if we need new models, not anything else, really.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Let's go to the next question.
The next question comes from William Stein from Truist.
"
38,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,18,"Yes.
I mean, obviously, with -- because we're still at the early stages, there are big error pause in any predictions.
It's like easy -- I think easy to predict long term but hard to predict the time in between now and then.
But it's -- we think Dojo will be competitive with the NVIDIA H1 at the end of this year and then hopefully surpass it next year.
And the key there is, I think, what's the energy usage required for a given amount of -- if you're training a frame of video, how -- what's the energy cost required to do that training? And we think probably -- we said this already actually at AI Day 2, so it's not new information, but we do see potential for an order of magnitude improvement relative to GPU, what GPUs can do for Dojo, which is obviously very specialized for AI training.
It's hyper-specialized for AI training.
It's not -- wouldn't be great for other things, but it should be extremely good for AI training.
So just like if you do an ASIC or something, it's going to be better than a CPU.
This is sort of, in some ways, like a giant ASIC.
And we're able to -- since we're operating one of the biggest GPU clusters in the world already, the -- we've got a good sense of how efficient the GPU clusters operate and what Dojo needs to do in order to be competitive.
But we think that it does have a fundamental architectural advantage because it's designed not to be -- the GPU is trying to do many things for many people.
It's trying to do graphics, video games.
It's doing crypto mining.
It's doing a lot of things.
Dojo is just doing one thing, and that is training.
And we're also optimizing the low-level software.
So it -- at a very sort of fair amount of level.
So it's just insanely good at efficient training.
And the intercommunication between the Dojo modules is extremely high.
It's not going across an Ethernet cable.
It's -- so anyway, the -- we see a path to an order of magnitude improvement in the energy efficiency or given unit of training.
But we also have to achieve that.
And so, when will it be achieved? It's hard to say, but we do see a path to get there.
And then, also on inference, like once you've got something trained, well, if you want to have a product that's a consequence of that training, that product may not be anything to do with cars, then the efficiency of inference is extremely important.
And we also have, by far, the most efficient inference computer in -- at the -- with the FSD computer in the car.
This has potential for products that aren't even really in automotive.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And William, do you have a follow-up?
"
39,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,19,"Yes.
It's roughly -- cell supply is roughly matched with that.
And the 1.8 million cars, if we get lucky, it could be more.
And then, the rest would go into stationary storage, the Powerwall and Megapack.
So yes.
Martin Viecha
OK.
Let's have the final question from Adam Jonas.
"
40,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,20,"Zach maybe is best to answer that.
"
41,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,21,"I think if we see a severe recession this year, which, like I said, hopefully, we don't, in severe recessions, cash is king big time because it's in such short supply.
So we want to be cautious about using cash for loans and that sort of thing for cars.
I feel we're in a very strong position to get through a recession because we really don't have any debt, and we've got over $20 billion of cash, which is great.
The cash is earning a ridiculous return, not a good return, so it's like nontrivial.
And the interest rate actually in the $20 billion is earning like quite a good amount.
And I've made this point on Twitter a few times.
I'm sure a lot of people on this call understand the fact -- the basic value of a security is a function of the risk-free rate or we'll see how risk-free it really is, but the T-bill rate.
So if you've got -- I think the -- if I recall correctly, the S&P 500 has a long-term rate of return of roughly 6%.
And so, I think the fed needs to be very cautious about having a fed rate that potentially exceeds 6%.
Like if we see deflation, and I think we are seeing deflation, then you would add the deflation number to the ""risk-free rate"" from the fed.
And as that starts to exceed 6%, now you're starting to exceed the long-term return of the S&P 500 and starts to become questionable as to why don't just put your money in T bills or savings account essentially instead of in the S&P 500 if the S&P 500 is variable and the bank interest rate is not? This is -- so basically, the fed is at risk of crushing the value of all equities.
Quite a serious danger.
"
42,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,22,"I mean, I'd love to answer -- I'll probably be asking the same question, but we would be jumping the gun on future announcements.
Martin Viecha
Fantastic.
Thank you very much, everyone, for all your good questions, and we will see you again in three months' time.
"
43,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,23,"I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
You can do the math.
If we were to get anywhere near 1,000 gigawatt-hours of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
So it will -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic.
We think it probably will be very significant in the future.

46,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,26,"Yes, go ahead, Zach.
"
47,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,27,"Yes.
Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software, to have full self-driving enabled, and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.
So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.
So that means that there's millions of cars where full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin.
And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
And then, when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.
That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.
Yes.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Let's go to the next investor question.
Since Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult and YouGov show Tesla brand.
"
48,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,28,"YouGov.
You can crush them with your life.
Martin Viecha
Show Tesla brand favorability declining in 2022 and division among partisan lines.
Such brand damage can impact demand.
Does Tesla track favorability? And how will any brand image be mitigated?
"
49,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,29,"Well, let me check my Twitter account.
OK, so I've got 127 million followers.
It continues to grow very rapidly.
That suggests that I'm reasonably popular.
It might not be popular with some people, but for the vast majority of people, my follower count speaks for itself.
I have the most interactive account -- social media account, I think, maybe in the world, certainly on Twitter, and that actually predated the Twitter acquisition.
So I think Twitter is actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla.
And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter and to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining, and it will help them drive sales just as it has with Tesla.
So the net value of Twitter, apart from a few people are complaining, is gigantic, obviously.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Let's go to the next question.
Please provide a detailed explanation of where you are on the 4680 ramp? What are the current roadblocks? And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?
"
50,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,30,"Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.
And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line, but it will be next year.
So it's an incredible product.
I can't wait to drive it personally.
It will be the car that I drive every day.
I actually just -- I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special.
So yes, so with respect to upgrading cars on -- that have Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed.
Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human.
So [Inaudible] how do we get ultimately to -- let's say, for argument's sake, if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%.
It will be Hardware 5 beyond that.
But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant.
So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is for Zach.
Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?
"
51,TSLA,2022,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,31,"No, go ahead.
"
52,TSLA,2022,4,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,0,"Yes, that's right.
Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of all the production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said, the ramp will really come 2024.
"
53,TSLA,2022,4,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,1,"I mean, beyond that, Elon, like in the vehicle space, even though the market is shrinking, we're growing and EVs have doubled almost year over year.
So like it -- whoever keeps up with the trend of EVs is going to be our competitor.
The Chinese are scary, we always say that.
But like a lot of people always look at the EV market share, but we always look at it is how much of the total vehicle space do we have, and we're just going to keep growing in that space.
There's 95% for us to go get.

54,TSLA,2022,4,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,2,
55,TSLA,2022,4,william-stein,truist-securities,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
Elon, you started to answer this earlier, but I'd like to ask this question about the AI elements of your business and ask if you could comment on progress around Dojo and Optimus and your anticipation for the likelihood, for example, for the company to disconnect the GPU cluster in favor of Dojo and to have some market achievement in Optimus.
"
56,TSLA,2022,4,william-stein,truist-securities,True,1,"Yes.
It sounds like the 1.8 million units you expect this year is supply, not demand-limited supply, it sounds like, by the lithium batteries.
If you were to become demand-limited, can you talk to us about your propensity to use price and your relatively high industry margins to grow units and share?
"
57,TSLA,2022,4,william-stein,truist-securities,True,2,
58,TSLA,2022,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Thanks, Martin.
Can you hear me well?
Martin Viecha
Yes.
"
59,TSLA,2022,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"Excellent.
Zach, actually, I'd like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost.
If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $36,000 in the middle of 2021.
And then, the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas.
And this quarter, I think we are close to $40,000 and we peaked maybe close to $42,000 at some point last year.
And so, my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $36,000, which would mean Berlin and Texas? And I think input cost, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car.
Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?
"
60,TSLA,2022,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"Excellent.
Thank you so much.
So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been like amazing in the quality of the product but also its rollout.
And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today? So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already? Or is that too early to really see like -- to expect like an uptick in the take rate?
"

"
62,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yes.
Thanks, Martin.
So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla.
I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.
On a full year basis, revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading.
Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP opex as a percentage of revenue improved further.
For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S.
and a rising interest rate environment.
Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S.
by nearly 10%.
Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors: first is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls; second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories; third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily toward Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.
Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years.
These improvements include our continued work to gradually move toward a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
The energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage.
While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
As we look toward 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
There are three key points I wanted to make here.
First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where inefficiencies are the highest.
But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.
This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.
As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well.
In that, we've priced our products with a view toward a longer-term cost structure.
Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our investor day in a month.
Thank you.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much, Zach.
Let's now go to investor questions.
The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
This has raised demand concerns.
Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates? I think --
"
63,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit.
The regulations here are still in flux and there continues to be updates, so this is just our best understanding at the moment.
But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year and growing over the course of the year as our volumes grow.
And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize, is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla's plans anyways.
And so, I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.
But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers.
And so, we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in our products going forward.
And so, as we're thinking about our pricing changes in the U.S.
a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not only from this that were received to some extent, but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $7,500 per car of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps.
So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analysts released expectations that Tesla automotive gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below 20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models.
Where do you see average selling price and gross margins after the price cuts?
"
64,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,
65,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes, I'll jump in on this.
So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, but I'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment.
So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and credits, and then $47,000 ASP across all models.
And so, two other comments I want to make on this, just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.
And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022.
But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is.
And so, as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business, and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.
And so, I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well because that is what we're primarily managing to now.
"
66,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yes.
I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial disclosures.
But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business.
So we're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year.
We're growing 20% a quarter so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.
And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla Insurance product.
And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.
And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're setting up insurance for the first time as opposed to going back and switching when they already have insurance set up.
So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business.
"
67,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"No, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting this business, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given that we're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies.
And that remains our priority here.
We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costs low and insurance stays affordable to our customers.
"
68,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yes.
I mean, our weighted average COGS for the company, if you were to assume Austin and Berlin were at the cost structure of our other factories, it was on the order of 2,000 to 2,500 of headwinds.
So I think from there, you can back into margin impact of those factories as of end of Q4.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And let's go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Pierre, please go ahead.
"
69,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control.
We're doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that.
And we talked about supply chain costs, expedites, logistics, attacking everything.
On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go.
And we're not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, as what we've seen from our forecast here, cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022.
So that's a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels.
So I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'll make progress.
And we'll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't have control over.
[Inaudible], is there anything on that?
Unknown speaker
Yes.
Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture benefits of indexes tapering out, but due to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reflected in our financials.
And while aluminum is down like 20% year over year, steel is about 30% down year over year, the global non-cells raw materials market continues to be influenced by geopolitical situations in Europe, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due to natural disasters like typhoon in Korea four months ago, pandemic lockdowns.
So we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertain exactly when.
In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to produce cars.
Martin Viecha
Sorry, do you want to go say something?
"
70,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yes.
I mean, the way that we've structured this is a full self-driving package has two components.
There's enhanced autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website.
We fully recognize that.
Then there's an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers, and we've released a portion of that.
And then, there's a minority of the total package that's remaining that will be released over time as software updates are there.
And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with future software updates.
"
71,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yes.
To be clear, the 1.8 million is not cell supply limited.
And yes, I mean, we did address that number earlier in the call.
Elon, do you want to answer?
"
72,TSLA,2022,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Yes.
I mean, the way that we've been using captive financing so far is to plug what we believe to be gaps in the market of existing third-party products.
And so, we have a couple of offerings in Europe.
We do loans for our energy business, retail energy business here in the U.S.
We do leasing and we do a small amount of U.S.
loans that are very targeted.
And so, we're using captives to support market caps, as I mentioned.
So basically, it's a vehicle to support vehicle sales, make sure customers have access.
I do think there's opportunity here to continue to grow this.
We are growing it slowly here.
It is a consumer of cash, so we're being cautious on how we do that.
But the plumbing is in place to do a lot more here.
And I think we'll have to see how things unfold over the course of the year and make decisions real time as to how much we ramp it up versus ramp it back.
"
73,TSLA,2022,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company,True,0,"The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here.
And I'm curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it's on the R&D side or on the sales side to accelerate growth or cost reduction? Or should we be thinking about this level of spend on a go-forward basis and some significant operating leverage as you scale up from here?
"
74,TSLA,2022,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company,True,1,"All right.

I'll take the rest of that offline.

"
78,TSLA,2022,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"OK.
Thanks, Elon.
My follow-up is one terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated.
I guess my question is what would need to change with U.S.
permitting laws to allow that? Kind of what would be your message to this administration or next? And do you think you could do a terawatt hour? What's the going price of that? Can you do that for under 100 billion bucks in the States? Thanks.

Martin Viecha
Yeah, we can hear you.
"
81,TSLA,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,1,"OK.
Sorry about that.
Any update on full self-driving? I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, would be available by the end of the year.
Is that still possible? Is it -- would it still be like a Level 4 or Level 5 that you're talking about? And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you'd have to think about?
"
82,TSLA,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,2,"And it would mean like Level 4, Level 5 kind of traditional definition you're talking about?
"
83,TSLA,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,3,"Got it.
And just as a follow-up.
You mentioned in the prior questions about IRA.
I mean it sounded like you thought you could get -- can you get all of it? I mean, because my interpretation is like the production credits, battery component credits for buyers seems very likely for you guys.
Is the sourcing part of it possible? Because that seems like a pretty tough hurdle given how much has to be sourced from the U.S.?
Unknown speaker
Yeah.
So, we have a cross-functional team that's looking very closely.
As you mentioned, the sourcing threshold increases by the year.
So, we're looking at all options and also getting some clarification from Treasury.
That's -- it's important to say that's only a fraction of the other credits.
We do manufacture ourselves in the U.S.
We manufacture the modules in the U.S.
So, that's a pretty thin.
So yeah, we feel confident that we'll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the year.
"
84,TSLA,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,4,
85,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,0,"Thank you, Martin.
So just to do a Q3 recap.
Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
We had our industry-leading operating margin reach of 17%.
And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months.
As our factories ramp, we're looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
So, it really, knock on wood, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year.
So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly.
Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday's hold rate, it would be 2,000.
Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell.
And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
Regarding Autopilot, at the end of -- at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and showed the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our trained computer, and high range of improvements of full self-driving software.
Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
Our goal with that AI Day was to post recruiting, and we've seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
I can't emphasize the importance of this enough because I think it finally has become clear to the smallest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
So, this quarter, we expect to go to wide release of full self-driving beta in North America.
So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving beta -- full self-driving will have access to the FSD beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchase a full self-driving option will immediately have that available to them.
So, the safety that we're seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we're seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide beta.
Let's see with respect to demand [Inaudible].
We've got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
I can't emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far in the future as we can see.
So, the factories are running at full speed, and we're delivering a recovery make and keeping operating margins strong.
We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road.
Of the 2 billion [Inaudible] trucks on the road, we only have about 3.5 million.
So, we're about a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global fleet.
Let's see.
Kind of based on my -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get on Twitter about buybacks.
And I think every one of our board members has gotten questions about buybacks.
The -- we've debated the buyback idea extensively at the board level.
The board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback.
But we want to work through the right process to do a buyback, but it's certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10 billion.
Even in the downside scenario next year, even if next year is -- was a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback.
This is obviously pending board review and approval.
So, it's likely that we'll do some meaningful buyback.
So, in conclusion, while the market teams revolve around the short term, it's very important to focus on the long term.
I can't emphasize this enough with investors and I think longtime investors, obviously, recognize this with Tesla.
We have our sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trend has been extremely good.
And several years ago, I said, I think on our earnings call, that I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest-cap company, I think, in the market.
At that time, I think it was around $700 billion.
And I said it required an incredible execution, at least some luck, and we didn't only achieve that.
Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple's market cap at the time.
And now, we have the opinion that we can far exceed Apple's current market cap.
In fact, I see a potential path with Tesla worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined.
So now that doesn't mean it will happen or that will be easy.
In fact, I think it will be very difficult.
It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion, and always luck.
But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let's say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco.
And I think that's -- I haven't quite seen that yet.
I mean this is the first time I've seen that potential.
So, we have an incredible product portfolio.
I think we've got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you've heard about, some of which you haven't.
We're in the final lap for Cybertruck.
We're building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Inaudible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.
And then with respect to batteries, we're moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States vertically integrated.
And our cathode Tesla refining, we're moving a ton of speed to do that.
So, I think it's an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.
None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla.
So, I'd like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives, and the whole Tesla team.
You guys rock.
You're the ones that make it happen.
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone. 
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And Zach has some opening remarks as well. 
"
86,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,1,"Well, yeah, I mean I think just at a high level, I'd say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA's requirements.
Do you want to add? 
"
87,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,2,"Great.
Yeah, the car is going to be sick and sick.
That is going to be a hall of famer next level.
Sorry, sorry, I took it longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeure if [Inaudible] one.
Martin Viecha
Right.
Thank you. 
"
88,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,3,"Of course.
There's Tesla Semi, of course.
So, we'll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1.
I'll be there in person.
And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- a heavy truck.
That's a Class A truck, Class A truck.
"
89,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,4,"Yeah, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
"
90,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,5,"Yeah, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
Yeah, sure.
Not up.
It's excellent.
But the point is it's a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.
And the number of times people talk about you can't -- it's impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.
And they'll ask, ""Well, what are your assumptions about watt-hour per kilogram and watt-hours per mile,"" and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.
I'm like, ""No, that's not the answer,"" but I was looking for numbers literally.
It's not a number.
It's [Inaudible] table.
You obviously don't need hydrogen for heavy trucking [Inaudible].
And we'll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
So, we expect to see significant -- we're tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America.
And obviously, we'll expand beyond North America.
And these would sell -- I don't want to say the exact prices, but they're much more than a passenger vehicle.
So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature would be worth several Model Ys.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp? And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells? And how will that change in the next year?
"
91,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,6,"Right.
Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
And yeah, it's going well.
We're just looking at this -- just going to be a major back to the future.
"
92,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,7,"Yeah.
And like I said, we're -- our goal is to strive toward 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [Inaudible] will be on top of that.
Unknown speaker
We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
"
93,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,8,"Yes, there's roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
Unknown speaker
So, when you're like one tower assembling a lot, well it's a lot of terawatt hours to get. 
"
94,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,9,"Yeah.
And on the cathode side, the [Inaudible] we think will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.
The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it's probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they [Inaudible].
And then there's the manganese wildcard as well [Inaudible] 
"
95,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,10,"Well, to be frank, we're very pedal to the metal come rain or shine.
So, we are not reducing our production in any meaningful way, recession or not recession. 
"
96,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,11,"Yeah, exactly.
So, I think the public, at large, realizes that the world is moving toward electric vehicles and that it's foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
But I wouldn't say it's recession proof, but it's certainly risk -- recession resilient because basically, it has -- people both have large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.
And then I think transitioning [Inaudible] generation to sustainable, you need solar wind with the stationary battery pack to buffer the power.
So, you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn't go [Inaudible] travel time.
So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, much faster than cars by a lot.
"
97,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,12,"Yeah, I'd like to say, we're -- like I said earlier, we're going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S.
vertically integrated.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Let's go to the next question.
The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S.
and especially in China?
"
98,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,13,"Yeah, we try to model out like, let's say, 2023 is a brutal recession year.
Even then, we generate meaningful cash.
Once you get out of that for [Inaudible]
Martin Viecha
Great.
Thank you very much.
And let's go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla's first platform with SMX to the second platform with 3 and Y led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold.
When do you see Tesla's third platform being released? And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
"
99,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,14,"Well, we don't want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously.
But at this point, we've done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi.
So, it's obviously against what we're working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform.
It will be smaller, to be clear.
But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
I mean, obviously, we're going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi into that platform.
But we -- as you've said to us many times, we're on a 2-for-1 target.
So [Inaudible] we're trying to get to that 50% number again.
It's like, we're going to take two.
If that's exactly what [Inaudible], how are we making two cars for the amount of effort that we currently take to make one Model 3.
"
100,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,15,"Needs to be considered.
"
101,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,16,"We're twice the output.
And we do believe this can be done.
By the way, I should mention that when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely very difficult path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work, and some luck to get to where Tesla with as much as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn't including Optimus.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Let's go to analyst questions next.
The first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.
Adam, go ahead and unmute.
"
102,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,17,"Yeah.
"
103,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,18,"We'll do whatever we have to.
Without limiting factors, we'll do.
We do not personally constrain ourselves.
We don't particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating.
Like if there was a great supplier who's better than us or we think actively is very good, or even where the economics of comparative advantage suggests that we should use that supplier, even if we could beat them, but we could use our resources to do something else that will be more productive, then we would in source in that case.
But if we have to go mine, we will mine.
"
104,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,19,"Well, I mean, I think the message to the government would be that there should be -- I should say, we've actually had conversations with a number of senior government leaders, White House, Congress, and whatnot.
And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expedited permitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future.
So, it doesn't make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine in the same category.
Coal is not of the future, lithium does.
And by the way, you can extract lithium with almost no disturbance to the local environment.
So, it's not actually ugly, nasty find situation.
So, I would recommend expedite permitting would really be helpful.
Basically, a fast track environmentally, I think a sense fast track things that are important for the environment and communities, for sure.
That seems logical.
And the reception has been positive.
So, we'll see if something happens with that.
I think probably on this earnings call, we're not ready to go into financial details of the -- what will take to get there.
But what we are seeing is practical improvements as we redesign the whole supply chain and all of the elements that go into battery cell.
We're figuring out dramatic efficiencies.
And I think we'll get net result which would be that the capital required to achieve that level output will be much less what people think. 
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And let's go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
Colin, go ahead and unmute. 
"
105,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,20,"We -- as I said earlier, we're expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by the end of this year.
So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval.
It won't have regulatory approval at that time.
But the car we'll be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend's house, to the grocery store without you touching wheel.
So, it's looking very good.
"
106,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,21,"Well, there's this debate is like what's the -- what are the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per mile.
Like we're not saying that that's quite ready to have no one behind the wheel.
It's just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers.
So, like when I came to Giga Texas from Brent's house, I never touched any of the controls already here.
And then there is a longer process of like called the march of 9s of like how many 9s reliability do you need before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it.
And that's some subjectivity as to how many nines you need.
But I think we'll be pretty close to having enough 9s that you're going to have no one in the car by the end of this year.
And certainly, without a question, that's whatever in my mind next year.
I think we'll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the car is safer much so than the average human.
"
107,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,22,"Yeah.
We'll meet those thresholds –-
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Colin, please go ahead and unmute.
"
108,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,23,"Well, it's -- there's definitely -- China is experiencing a reverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly.
And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.
The U.S.
actually isn't -- going North -- North America is a pretty good health.
Although the Fed is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they'll eventually realize that and bring back down again.
So, demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.
But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of a great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle production sales deliveries by -- on average 50% a year as far into the future as we can see.
Martin Viecha
Thank you. 
"
109,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,24,"Yeah.
Look, we are in the -- at least for now, quite in a good position of we're investing in everything we can think of to possibly invest in, and we're still generating cash.
So, I guess it gets a pretty good place to be.
"
110,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,25,"People don't even know old R&D so per day.
There are some of it, but a bunch of it.
"
111,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,26,"No.
It isn't because like it's not like -- it's not like engineers, they're not generic.
So, it's just like if you could you spend $5 billion or $10 billion, that will like -- that your actual R&D is useful product ship will be proportionate to that.
It's just not true.
Engineers are -- coming off with some assembly line like cookies or something.
"
112,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,27,"Get optimistic.
Don't change things.
What matters is where are the most brilliant people working.
And Tesla remains the -- Tesla and SpaceX are two companies where the smartest engineers want to work.
"
113,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,28,"I think one nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars.
You could have like a -- almost same the number of credit shares and they would not be able to do work one nickel of Tesla we can do.
You can't make it up in volume. 
Martin Viecha
OK.
Thank you very much.
Let's go to the next question from George at Canaccord.
George, please unmute.
Unknown speaker
Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question.
I think you would -- at your Annual Shareholder event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your production have started to come off the boil.
If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases? Thanks.
"
114,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,29,"Well, we're looking at the prices of -- [Inaudible] prices closely.
I mean, obviously, anyone can just Google what the price of -- future price of copper or steel is going to be.
It's just like one Google Search away.
And everyone can see that the commodities look on a go-forward basis are on a dropping a lot.
But in electric vehicles, things like battery-grade lithium are still crazy expensive.
So, we've got a mixture of things where prices are dropping and things where prices are increasing.
Unknown speaker
Yeah.
I would say quarter over quarter, steel, aluminum has stopped anywhere between 17% to 20% at the same time on the battery side.
"
115,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,30,"There's more deflation than inflation.
"
116,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,31,"And again, this is publicly available information.
Anyone could just Google it.
And I think Cathie Wood at Ark Invest is -- I'm going to make this point over and over again, to the Fed and the Fed is not listening because they're looking at the rearview mirror instead of looking out the front windshield.
"
117,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,32,"Yeah, there's latency.
"
118,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,33,"That's why I say that the best decisions make sense if you're looking through the rearview mirror, but not if you look out the windshield.
And windshield got the front windshield. 
"
119,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,34,"Actually, I want to caveat, I should say, growing production by 30% every year because deliveries -- we're trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery way at the end of every quarter.
So, in fact, we're just fundamentally running out of -- there weren't enough boats, there weren't enough trains, there weren't enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big.
So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren't just enough transportation objects to move them around.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future? Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market? Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand? Or has demand remained stable? Or is it even rising? There are three questions there.
"
120,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,35,"Yeah.
We'll probably see some cost reduction in 2023.
I'll be surprised if we did not.
Unknown speaker
And just as a follow-up, this is for Elon.
With your pending acquisition of Twitter and your stakes in SpaceX and Neuralink and Tesla, how much would the combined companies benefit from operating under a single super structure, if at all, like a Google Alphabet?
"
121,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,36,"It's not clear to me what the overlap is.
It's not zero, but it's -- I think we're reaching.
I'm not worried about it.
I'm not an investor.
I'm an engineer and a manufacturing person and a technologist.
So, I actually work and design and develop products.
That's what I do.
So, it's not a -- we're not going to have a portfolio sort of investments over it.
So, I don't know.
I don't see obvious sort of some -- get combined under an umbrella, at least right now.
So, I am excited about the Twitter situation because obviously another part incredibly well.
And I think it's massive that this sort of languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.
Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is, in order of magnitude, greater than its current value.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Let's go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Pierre, go ahead, please, and unmute.
"
122,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,37,"And yeah, I'd be surprised.
I think we'll do better than that.
"
123,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,38,"I mean I'm not turning down POs. 
"
124,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,39,"Yeah.
I mean, it's a hot pond but we're solving it.
And I think -- we still feel confident that 4680 will be the most competitive battery cell in the world. 
"
125,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,40,"And all the way down from the mine to the cell. 
"
126,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,41,"Many steps along the way.
"
127,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,42,"We're possibly lithium refinery. 
"
128,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,43,"Yeah.
And I think, once we are fully integrated, I think we still do see a path to hold roughly $70 kilowatt hour cell -- $70 per kilowatt hour cell before any incentive.
"
129,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,44,"Before incentive.
Yeah.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
Toni, go ahead and unmute yourself, please.
"
130,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,45,"Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%. 
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, can you tell us more about the product feature road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
"
131,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,46,"Wow.
OK.
The Semi doesn't use 4680s.
Yes.
We are making Model Ys.
Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.
And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?
"
132,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,47,"Ten thousand miles.
Pretty good.
"
133,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,48,"Yeah.
So -- and yes, I mean, and our output 4680 is growing exponentially.
So -- but it's worth bearing in mind like there are entire highly competitive companies that are very smart that all they do is make battery cells.
This is simply one segment of Tesla.
So, yes.
So it's not a total --
"
134,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,49,"We don't anticipate this being anything like Cybertruck or anything else.
Martin Viecha
OK.
Thank you.
And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.
Go ahead and unmute yourself, please.
"
135,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,50,"We'll achieve full self-driving full time -- that occurring is 100%.
And I think we'll -- we're almost there.
And then, of course, we've got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our control.
But anyone who's driving full self-driving cars, full self-driving beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement.
You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.
In fact, we almost are there.
And so, we're probably achieving that 100%.
The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, also extremely high given enough time, 100%.
Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo.
Like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as somebody continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs? So, the jury is out on Dojo.
Dojo team thinks they can outperform NVIDIA for neural training.
Dojo is out.
We will probably -- I don't know, next year, if that's true or not.
But we think we're probably -- we think it's -- the architecture of Dojo as the right architecture to win.
It depends on how well we execute in that architecture.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
I think, unfortunately, it's all the time that we have today.
So, thank you so much for your great questions and look forward to talking to you in about three months from now.
Thank you, and have a good day.

139,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,54,"Yeah, we obviously are -- yeah.
[Inaudible] But we'll also be committed to continuous growth.
Yeah.
At Tesla, we've always been committed to continuous improvement.
So, his friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I'm like, ""Now"" because we just keep improving the cars.
Always been the latest Tesla.
Yeah, there's still the latest Tesla.
So, I don't really -- yeah, the -- and on the gain, we do have some big technology upgrade like Plaid.
And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth.
There's nothing even close, in my opinion.
Just try one.
Epic.

Thank you.
The next question is, we keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter.
What are Tesla's plans to combat power cuts? And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?
"
140,TSLA,2022,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,55,"But we don't -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.

Thanks for taking my question.
I guess I'll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors? FSD sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus?

I'd love to have another update on 4680, Drew.
So last time we talked about it, there were -- was it was a question about like scaling up with manufacturing and there were still a few things to get right.
Is it fair to say that now you are at scale, and it's just a question of logistics to get bigger? So that's question number one.
And then question number two, on the kind of like innovation and cost reduction and efficiency improvements kind of path that you described at the battery day, where are we today? And how much time is it going to take to deliver all the potential you outlined then?

147,TSLA,2022,3,toni-sacconaghi,alliancebernstein,True,0,"Yes.
Thank you.
I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1? Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin? And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year? And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023? And I have a follow-up, please.

149,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,0,"Well, I'll take the second question first.
At Battery Day, we showed a timeline out to 2026 for all of the ideas we had proposed and had shared with everybody then.
"
150,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,1,"Yeah.
I mean, but just that's the rough -- just give you all -- it's in that order.
It's not like a month.
It's not six months.
It's six years.
And we are executing on all of those different ideas pretty aggressively in parallel with the opex that some people think isn't enough, but we're getting it done. 
"
151,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,2,"No, there aren't -- there are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed.
No doubt.

153,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,4,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're great talent, like we find someone awesome, we bring them into the company.
And people shouldn't believe we are turning people away. 
"
154,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,5,"And it's the whole system around it, right? It's not necessarily a specific form factor.
It's the attention to detail on how to bring costs out of the manufacturing process -- or remove processing steps.
"
155,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,6,"Yeah, exactly.
"
156,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,7,"Yeah.
And for those who watched the YouTube videos, like our on-site cathode facilities coming together, I'm really excited about that, which is a part of the plan that we discussed on Battery Day. 
"
157,TSLA,2022,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,8,"In Corpus Christi.
So, we're making -- putting our money where our mouths are and all the various efforts that we discussed on Battery Day.
On the technical challenges and the ramp question, which is your first question of 4680, no ramp is ever easy even at the end when you're 80% to the end, like it's still very challenging to get to the end.
And that sort of leaning out of yields, the final cycle time to achieve target -- you mentioned logistics.
It's not something that we're specifically focused on, I guess, but eventually could be a problem as we're talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the United States.
But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining, but we've made a lot of progress reducing technical risk in many areas.
Cycle times have dramatically improved.
Yield has dramatically improved.
And just walking the line here in Texas, like Martin was walking it yesterday, made some comments to me.
You really see the acceleration around you.
And we've made a ton of simplifications moving from the Fremont factory to Texas, and it's coming to play in speed of ramp here.
And of course, that's on one line of many here in Texas.
So, it's not like factory to factory.
It's a multiplication of both simplicity and scale.
So yes, we're excited about where it's headed.

Thanks, Martin.
Just to continue on Elon's theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production, and storage deployments in the third quarter.
On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed at length on prior calls.
In particular, raw materials, logistics, and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2, we've started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn't anticipate.
This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S.
and Europe.
Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks.
As a result, we have begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics.
We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs, and improve the experience of our customers.
As we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control.
On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year, as noted, just above.
This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1.
Boston and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what we saw in Q3.
And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating margins.
Thank you. 
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And let's go first to the shareholder questions.
The first shareholder question is given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla's ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024, and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?
"
162,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, there's a significant boost toward accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
Until such time, it's difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well-positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
"
163,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"It's the 1% point you made.
"
164,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"I'm, sorry, just to add before you jump in, Martin.
Just to echo Elon's point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean, we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup.
So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.
And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the company to press forward, I mean, most aggressively, as Elon has mentioned.
"
165,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah.
Effort costs, efficiency.
"
166,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
All those things.
Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.
"
167,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yeah.
I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit.
It's the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, opex as a percentage of revenue.
I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing.
I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the company grows.
It's very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the company, but it's growing much slower.
So, some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly.
So, I think there continues to be enormous opportunity to improve the overhead efficiency of the business, and we're seeing it.
"
168,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
I mean, how many R&D programs are we running in parallel right now? 
"
169,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"I also don't think cash is a good gauge of how much R&D you're doing.
"
170,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Until we get optimistic. 
"
171,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"I mean, like we don't have to spend billions of dollars to invest in the future and invent the future.
Engineers are also cost-conscious.
And we don't just burn the money out the window when we're trying to do R&D.
I would stop looking at like R&D as a cash investment for [Inaudible]
"
172,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"And the cost of shipping has come down tremendously.
Like last year, the cost of a container on the spot market from Shanghai got as high as $20,000.
And now it's $3,500, $3,600.
It's that kind of reality.
We're seeing deflation in a lot of commodities with a few exceptions as Elon mentioned on batteries.
"
173,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Committed to continuous improvement.
"
174,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"Definitely.
"
175,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"Yeah.
Just to add a little bit more context.
So, commodity increases were the highest in Q3 that we've seen over the last two years.
And so, when indexes change, it does take time before they fully reflect.
"
176,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Yeah, there's latency.
"
177,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"Yeah.
And so, what -- at least of what we know so far, the peak on the commodity side in Q3, I say peak, hopefully, it stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down.
There is a small amount of production that we're seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum primarily, but it's less than 10% of the total increases we've seen so far.
So, we're optimistic here based upon what we're seeing on the indexes for some of our cost structure.
So, this will start to come in over time.
But I just want to set expectations that there's not some windfall of cost reduction in this space coming in Q4, maybe some as we go into next year. 
"
178,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,17,"Unknown speaker
"
179,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,18,"Yeah, I can take that.
I think two points on this question.
The first is that based upon everything that we know, we don't see this as a large risk to the company.
Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn't have any impact on the long term of the company.
"
180,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,19,"Yeah.
And we put in place backup plans, and we're working through the supply chain as well.
Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
So, we'll see how this plays out, but it's not something that we're terribly worried about.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the next question is, how is production planning going for the Cybertruck? What is the initial phase 1 production target? When can we expect an update on pricing and final design? 
Unknown speaker
Yeah.
I mean, as Elon said earlier, we'd be on facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
We're still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
We started our data builds of all of the battery body in the existing -- 
"
181,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,20,"No sacrifice to cargo capacity. 
"
182,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,21,"Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
"
183,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,22,"Yeah, ramp is going well, as Elon said.
Total output is up 3x quarter over quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter as we said last quarter.
Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned.
On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
"
184,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,23,"[Inaudible] 
"
185,TSLA,2022,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,24,"No.
And on that note, we're pursuing aggressively North American iron cathode supplies.
And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date. 
Martin Viecha
Yeah.
Thank you.
The next question is on the Semi truck, which we already addressed.
So, I'm going to skip to the next one.
Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, productivity cost measures, and demand stimulation alternatives?
"
186,TSLA,2022,2,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company,True,0,"Thanks so much, guys.
Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the increased cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into 2023?
"
187,TSLA,2022,2,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company,True,1,"Great.
And then sorry to belabor a little bit on battery materials side.
But in terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more specific around some of the elements that you guys see in some of your supply chain that can prove troublesome yields for the 4680s, particularly around lithium and potential contaminants in either oxides, the carbonates that you guys end up seeing real issues with as you move into production?
"
188,TSLA,2022,2,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company,True,2,
189,TSLA,2022,2,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,0,"Yes.
Thank you for taking my question.
I have two as well.
In response to the question around demand, I think, Zach, you said maybe a little, and Elon, you said maybe some indication that you might see some pressure on demand.
And I'm wondering if that is really just speculation or whether there's any empirical data that you saw in the last month, whether it be cancellations or order lead times that led you to make that comment.
I think anecdotally, if you squint, the lead times have gotten a little lower over the last four months in both China and the U.S.
That's really the only visibility investors have.
So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on whether that's really just you're sort of anticipating there could be some impact because of high prices or whether they're something anecdotally or quantitatively that you could point to, please?
"
190,TSLA,2022,2,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,1,"So there's a denominator and a numerator and like, you increase production?
"
191,TSLA,2022,2,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,2,"OK.
Now I was just trying to follow up on the fact that you both said that maybe we're seeing demand be impacted a little bit, and that was the spirit of the question.
"
192,TSLA,2022,2,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,3,"OK.
Thank you.
Elon, I'm just wondering, a question for you.
Tesla's obviously changed dramatically in the last three years from near life or death to a company with consistent cash flow and industry-leading margins.
I'm wondering if you can comment on your personal role in the company and whether you see that changing in terms of your role, your commitment and time spent at the company over the next three or four years.
I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn't be on calls unless there's something unusual and you've been on every call since then.
I'm wondering.
"
193,TSLA,2022,2,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,4,
194,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,0,"Thank you, Martin.
So just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolonged shutdown of our Shanghai factory.
But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongest quarters in our history.
Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai.
And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
I do want to emphasize this is obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control.
The past few years have been quite a few force majeures, and it's been kind of supply chain hell for several years.
Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming in saving difficult challenges.
And huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacrificed a lot to get the factory back up and running in June and achieve a record output.
So also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin.
We achieved an important milestone of 1,000 cars a week in June.
And we're expecting -- sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the 1,000-vehicle per week milestone and hopefully in the next few months.
To be clear, we're currently making the cars with the 2170 cells, and Drew Baglino will address some of the 4680 questions later in this call.
But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year.
So we're not dependent on 4680.
4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
That said, we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas.
And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD Beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners.
They're very happy with the capability of the system and we'll continue to improve it every week.
We've now driven over 35 million miles with FSD Beta.
That's more autonomous miles than any company we're aware of, I think probably more than -- it might be more than any -- all other companies combined.
So -- and that mileage is growing exponentially.
With regard to manufacturing and technology, about five or six years ago, we said we wanted to become the best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage.
We're super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.
And in general, I think it is a very important thing to do.
We need to make stuff and make it efficiently and that's manufacturing.
So we've made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our -- the large castings, we make the world's largest castings.
We reduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
So that's, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly three times smaller than would normally be the case.
And I should say it's also lighter, cheaper, and has superior noise vibration harshness.
So it's good on every level.
But this journey is not over.
We'll bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we're not quite ready to talk about now but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.
Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before.
So you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact, you have very little time to tension the seatbelt.
If you've got to be -- the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner.
But because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens.
And so, we can tension the seat belts, and we can even adjust the airbag deployment because we can see, not just feel.
This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
And there's also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware.
In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
We are expecting to be -- still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
And we're very, very excited about that product.
I think it might actually be our best product ever.
Let's see.
FSD Beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we'll also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts of the world.
We're hosting our AI Day in a few months.
I think people will be amazed at what we're able to show off in AI Day.
So basically, there's a tremendous amount to look forward to in the second half of this year.
And I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times.
Super appreciate it.
Thank you. 
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And Zach has some opening remarks as well. 
"
195,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,1,"Yes, actually, it should be mentioned that the reason we sold a bunch of our bitcoin holdings was that we were uncertain as to when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate.
So it was important for us to maximize our cash position, given the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China.
We are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in future, so this should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin.
It's just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company, given COVID shutdowns in China.
And we have not sold any of our Dogecoin.
"
196,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,2,"Yes.
So exactly.
So the structural pack, even the C and the A architecture is beating the nonstructural pack.
And so over time, it will, with further refinement, be substantially superior to a car that is carrying a battery pack as though it is cargo.
And this is like -- it's very much very analogous to the early days of aviation where fuel tanks were initially carried like cargo until they realized actually, you should get dual use of a fuel tank as a wing and as fuel tank.
And that makes the planes lighter and better.
And the same is true of electric vehicles.
Martin Viecha
And on cost improvements, are they due to scale or about solving technical issues?
"
197,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,3,"Yes.
Yes.
I mean really, the two things that improve costs are economies of scale and tech and core technology.
"
198,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,4,"Technical issues like --
"
199,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,5,"Yes.
I mean there's some platonic ideal of the perfect product where the atoms -- you have exactly the right atoms and they're in exactly the right position, and you asymptotically approach this platonic ideal.
But it takes a lot of effort over time to figure out actually what is the platonic ideal and then actually gradually approach that.
"
200,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,6,"We did.
"
201,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,7,"I mean, Model S stage.
"
202,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,8,"On the rear casting.
But this will transfer for improvement with the casting.
So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the -- on the way is done in the past where you've got 120 different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise.
So we're already way better than that with current casting, but there's still a lot of opportunities to reduce the master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts, as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact that there's a cast A.
"
203,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,9,"Well, since Andrej was writing all the code by himself, naturally, things have come to a grinding halt.
And so irony.
So Andrej was also in which we have transparent respect for Andrej.
He's decided to -- I think he wants to contribute more to, I think, core AI at an academic level and get back to coding individually.
But we've got a team of about 120 people in our software AI group that are extremely talented.
And I think we will have -- I'm highly confident we will solve full self-driving and it still seems to be this year.
I know people are like says that.
But it does seem to be epic.
It does seem as though we are converging on full self-driving this year.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, how is the 4680 ramp going? And is Giga Texas producing cells yet?
"
204,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,10,"We're hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
Martin Viecha
Great.
Thank you very much.
And now let's go to analyst questions.
The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
"
205,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,11,"Yeah.
Maybe another way of putting it is that the -- our focus right now is on the dozens of little issues that inhibit the production ramp of the 4680.
Some of the more challenging ones have been feeding the anode-cathode material because we're using this revolutionary dry electrode process.
But when something is revolutionary, it's a lot of unknowns that have to be resolved.
So we're confident of resolving those unknowns but it's very, very difficult.
It's -- yes, we're making rapid progress on that point.
So the first order of business is really get the basics right, get to high volume and high reliability and then very rapidly iterate within that to enhance the energy density and reduce the cost of the cell.
"
206,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,12,"We still have our Dogecoin. 
"
207,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,13,"I'd say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
It's the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
"
208,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,14,"But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.
And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supply chain.
The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount of battery output per year? This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
So yeah.
"
209,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,15,"People often ask me, if you often ask me, is some breakthrough needed in battery technology for the world to transition to sustainability? The answer is no.
Even if there was zero technology breakthroughs, so it literally zero from where the technology is right now, we could fully transition Earth to sustainable energy.
The issue is very much the rate at which the entire supply chain from mining to refining to cell production.
How fast can that grow? It's growing fast with the faster it grows, the faster we transition to a sustainable energy economy. 
"
210,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,16,"Well, I think it's kind of very difficult to predict anything 10 years from now.
I hope civilization is still around, frankly.
I don't count that as a win. 
"
211,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,17,"Yeah, exactly.
Hopefully, we haven't had World War III by then.
So the -- we do see constraints in refining of the materials necessary for lithium ion batteries.
I do want to emphasize this as -- it is not due to a scarcity of the raw material.
In the case of lithium, lithium is one of the most common elements on Earth.
It's pretty much everywhere.
But refining of the lithium into ultra-high purity battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate is quite difficult and requires a massive amount of machinery and it's a hard thing to scale.
As it was also difficult to create the anode and cathode.
I think -- my guess is maybe two-thirds of batteries will be iron phosphate or maybe iron phosphate with some manganese.
And there's plenty of -- there's a ridiculous amount of iron.
In fact, Earth is -- a little bit of trivia.
says, what is Earth made of more than anything else? Iron.
Iron is the No.
1 ingredient of Earth by mass.
No.
2 is oxygen, which is wild.
Yes.
Basically rust.
Actually, we're stuck together.
We're a rust ball.
That's roughly -- that's almost two-thirds of Earth, I think, is rust.
We are like a rusty ball bearing with a little bit of other stuff.
So -- but plenty of lithium.
So anyway, there's not like a shortage of materials.
"
212,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,18,"Absolutely.
To clear, there's no fundamental barrier here.
It's simply a rate question.
Like at what rate can you scale production? And I think we're seeing a very rapid increase in battery production and in the whole supply chain.
If you were to say today, what are concerns appears down the road? I would say one of the concerns is the machinery to refine the -- the critical ingredients of lithium-ion cells.
So the lithium itself and then the cathode, which I said like I said, will be mostly iron phosphate, partially some manganese.
I think almost all stationary storage will be iron phosphate and then you really just need nickel chemistry for long-range vehicles and like aircraft and that kind of thing.
"
213,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,19,"Yes.
If our suppliers don't solve these problems, then we will.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
Emmanuel, go ahead and unmute yourself.
"
214,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,20,"Well, right now, our problem is very much production.
So we've long leads on -- as anyone can tell, if they order our car, you order Model Y, it'll arrive sometime next year.
So this is clearly not an issue for many months for us.
Our problem is overwhelmingly that of production.
So yeah.
"
215,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,21,"Some maybe.
"
216,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,22,"Yeah.
I think it's -- maybe just one thing worth mentioning the -- that there is surface between value for money and fundamental affordability because sometimes people say, ""Well, if you got all this demand.
Why don't you just raise the price to some -- double the price or something?"" And this is usually expressed by somebody who's rich.
But there's -- even if you rail value for money to infinity, if somebody does concerns, do not have enough money to buy it, even a product where the desirability is rail to infinity, they basically cannot buy it.
So, this is why you kind of just raise prices to some arbitrarily high level because you pass the affordability boundary and then the demand falls off a cliff.
So, I do feel like we've raised our prices or we raise the price quite a few times.
They're frankly at embarrassing levels.
But we've also had a lot of supply chain and production trucks and as we've got crazy inflation.
So, I'm hopeful, this is not a promise or anything, but I'm hopeful that at some point, we can reduce the prices a little bit.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Emmanuel, do you have a follow-up?
"
217,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,23,"Yes, a lot of force majeure in the last several years, that's for sure.
"
218,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,24,"Well, I mean, we -- I think we've got a good chance of exiting this year at 40,000 vehicles a week.
"
219,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,25,"Yeah.
We've had many 30,000-car weeks already, so I think a 40,000-car week is within reach by the end of this year.
"
220,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,26,"There's always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like S-curve, and that intermediate part of S-curve the difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
But the end part of the S-curve, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
And so that's why I'm confident we'll get to 5,000 cars a week at -- in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year or early next year and probably but not certainly, 10,000 cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Colin, go ahead, please.
"
221,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,27,"Yeah, we will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
I think probably just before we go to quiet beta or beta is anyone who wants to use the beta software with all the caveats associated with that can use it, then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
The value of FSD is, I think, extremely high and not well understood by most people.
It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
"
222,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,28,"Yeah.
The contaminants from the 4680 are not a factor, which is not an issue.
Martin Viecha
OK.
Thank you very much.
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
Toni, go ahead, please.
"
223,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,29,"No.
I mean, I think we've said this now for many years, I know has proven true.
Tesla does not have a demand problem, we have a production problem.
And we've almost always had it's a very rare exception it's always been a production problem.
I think that will remain the case.
"
224,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,30,"Yeah, absolutely.
As we increase production, more demand is needed obviously.
"
225,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,31,"But we're trying to make the backlog lower, not longer.
Unknown speaker
Building factories and building --
"
226,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,32,"We don't want a long backlog.
That's annoying.
It'd be like go to a restaurant and you order a burger and you have to wait three hours and like, that's annoying.
You want to get your burger right away.
Same with the car.
So we want that lead times to reduce.
"
227,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,33,"We don't have like -- like because we see daily orders from around the world for our cars, it's actually -- it is like a mood barometer of people's confidence in the economy.
But one can't read too much into it because things can vary a great deal from one day to the next.
Consumer sentiment is all over the map.
So it's -- manage price, frankly.
But we have so much excess demand.
That is really just not an issue for us.
It might be an issue for some other companies but it is not an issue for us.
"
228,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,34,"Well, the -- right now, the best Chinese EV manufacturer is Tesla train.
We're actually doing the best, thanks to our incredible team in China.
But I have a lot of respect for the Chinese, our manufacturers and EV manufacturers in particular.
I think they will be a force to be reckoned with worldwide.
They're very -- they're smart and they're hardworking.
And I think anyone who is not -- any company that's not as competitive as them will obviously suffer a share decline.
So obviously, we have a lot of respect for the current companies in China and then their capabilities, yes.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, when will Tesla have a unified vector space for both static and moving object network? Will this be a V11 or later version? If the latter, can you explain what makes it a difficult problem in layman terms?
"
229,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,35,"I do a lot of unusual things, let's face it.
Basically, if there's only good news, I won't be on the call.
But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I'll be on the call -- relatively speaking, if there's bad news.
And we have this good news, then I won't be on the call.
But I'm committed to the long -- I mean, I'll work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of sustainability and autonomy.
Martin Viecha
Fantastic.
Thank you very much.
The next question comes from William Stein.
Please go ahead and unmute yourself.
"
230,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,36,"Well, I don't want to steal thunder from AI Day.
So I think we'll have some exciting news on AI Day that I think will be further ahead than probably most people think.
But I don't want to -- I'd love to answer you but I think we'll leave that excitement for AI Day.
"
231,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,37,"Well, there's we've done -- we've been working with our suppliers side.
We don't currently intend to make chips ourselves.
We don't think there will be a need to make chips, but we have been working closely with a number of suppliers.
Actually, just met with one of our key supplier's CEOs right before this call.
We had a great meeting.
They're going to make major investments in some of the critical chips and components that we need in the car.
And I'd actually like to take a moment to thank our key suppliers once again for supporting us through difficult times.
And they really went above and beyond to support us.
So to all our suppliers out there, thanks very much.
"
232,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,38,"[Inaudible] even now where the supply chain issues with our Tier 1s and Tier 2s, get into it with us on the engineering side when we find solutions, whether it's alternative chips or changing the entire structure of this pack to make it work.
And I think that's an advantage we have that many other OEs just simply cannot.
I think Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company.
And so one of the ways that we've been able to address supply chain issues on the chip front is by rewriting of software to be able to use different chips or, in some cases, achieve dual use of a single chip, which is even better.
And actually, quite frankly, the chip shortage has served as a forcing function for us to reduce the number of chips in the car.
Yes, it turns out we had more chips than we needed.
But that's a testament to our software team that we're able to roll a new chip into the car, write a whole new patch of software for that chip and -- without interrupting production.
"
233,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,39,"From a supply chain standpoint, do we -- what do you think about the chips and whatnot?
"
234,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,40,
235,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,41,"OK.
This answer will be understood by 0.01% of the audience, I think.
I suppose people want to find out what a unified factory space would actually mean.
It essentially would be if you can take -- if instead of netting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if they could be net together at the neural net level, then you don't need to reconcile them within C++ heuristics.
That is an architecturally better way to -- that's the most desirable outcome.
It's -- I think it's probably not necessary to achieve full self-driving, but it would be a slight improvement in the efficiency of the self-driving.
And it's certainly something we want to get to.
Yes.
The sort of nirvana situation is you have surround video/auto labeling of all static and dynamic objects.
And you have then surround video inference with spatial memory as well.
Then that's -- I mean, I think we're almost certainly there before the end of the year.
Yes, I'm not sure how many you would understand that.
But I should say also, we are also confident of improving the frame rate and as we some of the legacy neural nets, we think we might be able to get to the frame rate of what the -- only cameras is maybe up to 36 fps, which is actually a lot of frames, considering it cameras.
It's certainly comfortably above 24 frames, which is basically the movie -- frame rate of movies.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is Elon recently tweeted about lowering prices once inflation cools down.
Can you elaborate on what do you mean by cooling down and how aggressively the company will lower prices? More broadly, how do you think about the auto pricing long term?
"
236,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,42,"Yes.
So since we have -- there's a quite a long wait when somebody orders in a car, in some cases, six months; in some cases, it could be up to a year.
We have to anticipate what the probable inflation rate is over that period of time.
So that's what we're trying to do.
When we -- when or if we see indications that the inflation rate is declining, then we would not need to increase our car prices.
It's possible that there could be a slight decrease in car prices, but this is fundamentally dependent on macroeconomic inflation.
It's not something we control.
If I were to guess, and I would take this with a grain of salt, I think inflation will decline toward the end of this year.
We're certainly seeing prices of commodities trending lower.
Yes.
But take it with a grain of salt.
This is -- making economic prognostication is fraught with error.
I don't know if you guys want to -- do you want to say anything about --
"
237,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,43,"Yes.
But I think that's just like for most commodities, we're seeing a downward trend toward the end of this year or next year.
Some commodities, the pricing of lithium is insane.
I would like to, once again, urge entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business.
The mining is relatively easy.
The refining is much harder.
So lithium is actually a very common -- sort of very -- like lithium pretty much everywhere.
But you have to refine the lithium into battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, which has to be extremely high purity.
So it is basically like minting money right now.
There's like software margins in lithium processing right now.
So I would really like to encourage, once again, entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business.
You can't lose.
It's a license to print money.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is you made the right economic call before most on inflation when you diversified into bitcoin.
It has since shown it's not much of a hedge in the real-world test the last few months.
How do you think about it as an asset over long term? And what do you need to see to change your view?
"
238,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,44,"Well, Tesla is -- Tesla's goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
We're not really -- cryptocurrency is a sideshow to the sideshow.
We're not a -- cryptocurrency is not something we think about a lot.
We think a lot about scaling production and accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, which the record heat waves around Earth, so to emphasize the urgency of that transition.
So that is what we're trying to do is make electric vehicles and solar and stationary storage battery packs.
But the three pillars of a sustainable energy future, which is like solar and wind for energy generation, stationary battery packs for storage of the solar energy because of its intermittency and then electric vehicles, the third pillar.
And if those three things are solved, we have a sustainable future for civilization.
And the fundamental good of Tesla and the reason we're doing this, so certainly, my primary motivation here is to have the day of sustainable energy comes sooner.
That's our goal.
We're neither here nor there on cryptocurrency.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question on 4680.
Elon noted that 4680 plus structural pack is not yet optimized.
Can you please share the general path of 4680 in structural packs in terms of cost efficiencies when compared to the traditional 2170 pack? Will cost improvements be mostly due to scale or do we need to solve some technical issues?
"
239,TSLA,2022,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,45,"Yes.
So structural pack where we get dual use of the battery cells as structure and as energy storage in the same way that an aircraft gets dual use of the wing as a fuel tank and as a wing is, I think, unequivocally, from a physics standpoint, the superior architecture.
It's the A architecture.
Now because it is new, we'll start off getting, I don't know, aspirationally a C within an A architecture.
But the potential is there for to get radically better and then unequivocally better than a battery pack, which is carried like a sack of potatoes.

Thank you very much for taking my question.
Elon, in the past, you've given some assessment as to the likelihood that you can achieve success in some of the more interesting AI-oriented efforts, not only FSD but also Dojo and Optimus.
Perhaps you can give an updated view on those.
"
244,TSLA,2022,2,william-stein,truist-securities,True,1,"OK.
And perhaps a follow-up if I can.
We've heard a lot from others and certainly to some degree from you all about the shortages in semiconductors, in particular.
We have seen some big, important customers of that type of product decide to sort of leverage the ecosystems that exist to make some of their own in those categories.
I'm wondering to what degree you're doing that.
That's outside of Dojo in terms of the -- I guess, on the inference side, you're certainly doing that in the car, but what about sort of the more mundane areas like microcontrollers and the like? Is there any internal effort to improve supply chain and maybe improve other performance aspects?

247,TSLA,2022,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
I'd like to ask like a question on 4680 and the structural battery pack.
And I'd love to understand where you stand on the technology and efficiency and energy density road map that you described at the Battery Day.
So what I'm trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of the battery cell itself? How much silicon do you have in it? How much energy improvement have you achieved already so far? And the reason why I'm asking that is because you have like very smart guys on Twitter who shared experience about trying to fully empty a Model Y from Texas from Austin and noticing behaviors and like recharging behavior that suggested that maybe these cars had like very, very high mileage, very high range, and were like artificially limited in range in software.
So I'm just kind of trying to understand how much of an edge you're building at the moment with the 4680 and the battery back on range.
"
248,TSLA,2022,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"This is actually a great -- exactly where my follow-up is.
So, Elon, you always mention this 50% per annum sustainable growth target that you guys have.
And so my question here is when we see like the difficulty regarding the commodities, raw materials, swinging prices, I'm kind of wondering, as you are planning for this 50% per annum growth, if we stand today over the next five to 10 years, how much of that do you feel you've secured through your work at entering into long-term contracts and things like that? And you were calling for entrepreneurs to go into the lithium business.
So, does that mean you don't have enough lithium secured to grow 50% per annum over multiple years? And what's -- how much of that is secured today? And how fast can you improve that basically?
"
249,TSLA,2022,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"Not that fun.

251,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,0,"Yes.
We're certainly seeing, I mean, it's kind of a whole spectrum.
On the battery metal side, for example, the price of lithium has really shot up.
We used to be $11 a kilogram to more than $80 a kilogram.
But it's -- not every situation is that bad so it's kind of a spectrum.
Unknown speaker
Carbon steel, aluminum, [Inaudible] carbon steel and aluminum has started trending down.
We will see the benefits of it only probably later part of this year or early next year.
"
252,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,1,"Yes, do you want to do the architecture?
"
253,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,2,"I can take that.
So Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductor companies.
So with a portfolio of that size, there are always challenges.
Things are more stable on the latest generation chips.
We still see some tightness in the older generation semiconductors, especially in the analog and mixed signal space.
But we have line of sight to solve for the volumes being contemplated for both Austin and Berlin.
And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin, thanks to record output from our partners and have line of sight that matches the planned output from both factories.
We've grown cell production significantly on a 12-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts with all our partners for key battery metals.
So we don't see any major problems for the components, of course, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.

254,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,3,"Yeah.
Let me just try to provide like a super straightforward answer.
Like as Elon mentioned before, our priority was really on simplicity and scale during the initial 4680 and structural battery ramp.
So we weren't like putting all the bells and whistles in from day 1 because if so, we would be sort of suffering under a string of serious miracles that we would need to achieve to get going.
But as we attain the manufacturing goals that we've stated at the ramp that we need to hit next year, we are certainly planning to layer in new material technologies and higher-range structural packs, like we're not like holding back goodies for some rainy day or something like that.
"
255,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,4,"Totally agree, yeah.
"
256,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,5,"Yeah.
Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
"
257,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,6,"Yeah, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I've seen.
And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as possible? And we're taking these risks that we've discussed at Battery Day.
And our plan is as we derisk them and they are successful, we want to bring them back to our partners so that they can go faster, too, because that's all on the mission, right, like how do we accelerate.
"
258,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,7,"But the other thing on the LFP thing is that it isn't just that there's more access to material that way.
The actual refining process is less capital intensive to make a good LFP cathode.
And so there's -- it's not just scalable on the resource side, it's scalable on the refining side.
"
259,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,8,"Yes.
The other thing I would say is -- we are working with our suppliers to ramp their capability as quickly as possible.
And it's not like we have a problem in the next year or two to -- specifically to your question.
But when we look 10 years out, yes, we need to do more to accelerate the growth.
And that is why we are making our own investments, like we are building a facility here in Texas.
The steel is going up, you can see it in the flyovers.
We're working on a lithium refining activity as well ourselves because the best way to learn how to accelerate something is to do it yourself.
So these are the things we're doing to move it all forward.
"
260,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,9,"Yeah.
I mean our internal plans are to have the capacity utilized by the end of the year.
It takes time to ramp there.
It will be a challenge.
There's a lot that needs to happen to get there but that's what we're working on.
"
261,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,10,"Shanghai and Fremont, as we said last month for record production and they're really fire to better doing really well.
But then also Berlin are coming on strong.
Theoretically, they also had record quarters, last quarter.
And if we ramp them to the capacity shown in the deck by the end of this year, we'll be at that rate.
"
262,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,11,"No, it's more just like you can't look at the backlog and state much about demand because we're doing a lot on the other side to change the production.
"
263,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,12,"Yes.
And we've gained the perspective through putting our first structural pack in production that it is actually the A architecture.
Like before we did that, it was a hypothesis that was backed with -- I got a lot of modeling and first principles analysis.
And now we've actually built and are more confident in that assertion.
"
264,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,13,"Yeah.
And I guess just maybe we don't talk about it very often, but we do have a lot of custom silicon in the vehicle already.
Microcontrollers, yes, some battery management, yes, some power electronics, yes, some.
So we try to go after where there's actually a technical advantage.
And in the future, I think we're going to look at where there's a supplier --
"
265,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,14,"Yeah.
And our goal is as we mature and scale the platforms is to integrate more functionality into fewer chips, like that is the way that it's gone with laptops and phones.
It's going that way in cars.
And we're trying to do that wherever it makes sense to do it as quickly as we can.
"
266,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,15,"Yeah.
I think -- I mean, from a high level, instead of designing and building our own microcontrollers, we're partnering with key partners that understand the architectural requirements and they'll take the specs and design something for us.
We've done that, to your point, the battery sensing space.
We've got some application-specific ICs.
But yes, integrating, reducing the number of components, it's a mix of supply chain but it also makes the reliability of the end product better because there's less failure points.
So that's always been the mantra.
"
267,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,16,"Unknown speaker
"
268,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,17,"Yes.
I think technical issue is not the right.
"
269,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,18,"Getting to the optimal design, right? Like you always start with some access.
Some people might call it that, but that's not really what you think it is initially.
It's that you don't know how early you can get it until you've done it a couple of times.
"
270,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,19,"Yes.
I mean, you might need to create a new alloy.
Then you need to figure out how to cast it, then you need to ramp the casting machine with the new alloy.
"
271,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,20,"On improvement is something we're used to here, and it's something like we've done with their vehicles and our design since the beginning.
I mean, even we're talking a couple of weeks ago, like the first version of the front casting that we made that went into the early vehicles is like -- 
"
272,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,21,"No, I'm talking about like first Model Ys.
Since we've ordered more dies because bringing more dies for more production, we've saved like four or five kilos of mass with just die iteration.
And that's something we do at Tesla like quite regularly and we'll continue to do.
So we're not happy with a C, like maybe we're at a C-plus now because I think we got to keep going to B-minus.
"
273,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,22,"Yes, I was going to say the same thing, right? Like we're not just evaluating the pack and insulation either.
It's the pack plus the body, the integration, do we have mass in the right places, we have the cost in the right places and only just the right amount.
And I think we've gone through one iteration.
We're going to do another one with Cybertruck.
I mean, we're taking the learnings and doing.
The next version hopefully is a B-plus in A architecture.
That's certainly a target.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, how do you feel the progress of FSD is going? And does Andrej Karpathy is leaving, have any significant impact on time lines or potential progress?
"
274,TSLA,2022,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,23,"Yes.
So we are making progress on 4680.
But right now, as Elon mentioned, we are leveraging supplier cells, which we have in sufficient quantity to ramp Texas and Berlin.
We expect to ramp total 4680 production to exceed 1k per week by the end of the year, hopefully before -- well before.
In Q2, at Kato, we fully automated power conveyance for the dry anode-electrode tool there, unlocking major increases in production and improvements in yields.
Since March because of that, Kato output has grown about 35% month-over-month each month since, and yields throughout the factory are already at targets in most areas and trending in that direction and a few others.
We did feed learnings from Fremont cell and pack lines to Texas and Berlin there, a carbon copy.
Cell design was revved to unlock higher performance and manufacturing simplicity.
Manufacturing lines were further integrated and we in-sourced additional content.
For these reasons, there are some new ramp challenges to overcome in Texas and Berlin.
Specific to Texas last quarter, cell equipment was fully installed and commissioned and we produced our first commissioning car sets of cells through the end of the line.
Our target for Texas is to begin production this quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly output before the end of this year.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The next question is on 4680 as well, but I think Andrew has covered everything that was in the next question.
So the following question is with regards to the ramp of production in Austin and Berlin.
How is the situation with regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells and other components? How about cost inflation impacting profitability of these other plants?
"
275,TSLA,2022,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Yeah.
Thank you so much.
I have a question on your vehicle demand and then a quick follow-up on supply.
First, on the demand side.
Are you seeing any sort of pressure in the order book or the pace of new order or any sort of like slowdown as a result of the pressures that the consumer is experiencing? Are you worried about it in light of your view of the risks to the economy that I think you expressed, Elon?
"
276,TSLA,2022,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"Yeah.
My follow-up was actually on the supply side.
So it was very encouraging to see that you're quantifying your current installed capacity at basically already in excess of 1.9 million units installed currently.
How quickly do you think that you can fill that capacity?
"
277,TSLA,2022,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,2,
278,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yes.
Thanks, Martin.
I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent execution during the second quarter.
Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the quarter.
Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records.
The Shanghai factory resumed full production, and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through their initial ramps.
Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years.
I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.
You've embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%.
The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factory restart costs, and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.
Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, which are progressing well but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.
While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which experienced some foreign exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and logistics.
The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online and progress on unit economics.
Our storage business remains component-constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of the year.
We are greatly appreciative of the patience and flexibility shown by our customers while we work through these challenges.
Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related start-up costs have wound down as these factories have moved into production and their costs are now reflected in automotive COGS.
Additionally, we converted a majority of our bitcoin holdings to fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&L included within restructuring and other.
We also incurred restructuring charges related to targeted staffing reductions.
"
279,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"We still have it.
"
280,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve one of our strongest operating margins of 14.6%.
Our free cash flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai factory shutdown.
However, we expect this will show as a benefit in Q3 as our working capital-related cash flows restabilize.
As we look ahead and as Elon mentioned, we are positioned for a record-breaking second half of the year.
We're quite excited about this.
A couple of things to keep in mind as we progress.
Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies will continue to weigh on our margins for the balance of the year.
However, the impact should reduce as we increase ramp.
Second, as we've mentioned before, we expect to continue to see recognized global pricing to increase as our backlog flows through.
However, macroeconomic-related cost increases will also continue to be part of our story.
And finally, despite losing more builds in Q3 than expected, we're still pushing to reach 50% growth this year.
This target has become more difficult but it remains possible with strong execution.
And as Elon mentioned, no more force majeure events for the balance of the year. 
"
281,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Thank you.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And now let's go to the questions from investors.
And the first question is, Chinese EV manufacturers seem to be doing a better job than their Western competitors, excluding Tesla, at innovating in software and design.
How can Tesla make sure the company is staying ahead of those manufacturers, both within China and outside of China?
"
282,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Just to add on the profitability part of the question.
Q2 was our largest increase yet over the last handful of quarters on inflation and commodity-related increases to our cars.
It's fairly evenly spread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supply chain.
So, you know, I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year.
It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
So as we look through to the end of the year, what we're seeing is we don't think the inflation-related increases in Q3 will be as big as Q2.
But as Elon had mentioned, there's uncertainty on pricing here.
And we don't have full exposure, as [Inaudible] had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some contracts in place.
But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
So we're managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is impacting our financials.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?
"
283,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"OK.
Maybe just two things to add.
Specifically on your question, are we seeing a macroeconomic impact on our demand? Not that I can tell.
Maybe a little.
"
284,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"But it's not material.
The second thing to Elon's point about backlogs, we have a very long runway with very long lead times here.
I mean, certainly, the world is uncertain, and we'll have to see where things go with commodity prices, how quickly we're ramping production, what the state of the road looks like at some point next year.
But the demand is not something we spend really any time talking about.
"
285,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
I don't really think we have anything to comment on, yes, the purity specs of lithium on this call right now, yeah.
"
286,TSLA,2022,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,
287,TSLA,2019,1,colin-langan,ubs,True,0,"Oh, great.
Thanks for taking my question.
I mean, it sounds like from the tone of the call that you don't see that there is a demand issue for some of the products.
But margins seem to be under pressure and typically automakers stop pricing when there is a demand issue.
So, what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?
"
288,TSLA,2019,1,colin-langan,ubs,True,1,"As a follow-up, you're still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year.
Are you still confident in the 3,000 per week? And do you have a battery supplier yet that's getting pretty close to the point?

290,TSLA,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks.
First question, Elon, a couple of days ago, I asked you how safe is the autopilot technology and you said something like twice as safe as normal driving.
But you seem to be in a really unique position to really collect exabytes of data, you could potentially be externally validated much more rigorously provided to a regulatory body or insurance institute to just show how much safer autopilot is.
When could we expect to see Tesla do that, that type of validation that investors could also get a sense of? It seems really, really important for adoption.
Thanks.
And I have a follow-up.
"
291,TSLA,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Okay.
I understand it.
"
292,TSLA,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"Okay.
And just as a follow-up, Elon, and you kind of alluded a little bit, there is just so much drama around Tesla's share price and quarterly results.
From the outside, at least, it just looks like a huge distraction.
And at the same time, there is so much alternative capital and large amounts of strategic capital that is incrementally deployed in domains where Tesla has real leadership.
So, how important is it for Tesla to be a publicly traded company, Elon?
"
293,TSLA,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,"But is it important? I mean, do you think the Company's value is maximized being public? Is there just only so much you can do and you just got to play the hand you're dealt?
"
294,TSLA,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,4,"Yeah.
"
295,TSLA,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,5,"Okay.
Understand.

296,TSLA,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,6,
297,TSLA,2019,1,philippe-houchois,jefferies,True,0,"Yes, thank you for taking the questions.
I'm just wondering if you can comment on the agreement you seem to have reached with FCA on the possibility of selling your CO2 credits to them in Europe and what that means to your potential cash inflow.
When that might start occurring? And if there is, by any chance, any of those things already in the Q1 cash position?
"
298,TSLA,2019,1,philippe-houchois,jefferies,True,1,"All right.
And can I ask you a question of coming back to what Adam was saying about the drama that surrounds your stock, unfortunately.
Why don't you reduce some of it by disclosing on a monthly basis your deliveries and also maybe disclosing early your greenhouse revenue instead of just reserves, so we get right away a better view on some of these details that kind of move the stock?

Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2019 Q&A Webcast.
I'm joined today by Elon Musk; JB Straubel; Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
Our Q1 results were announced at about 2:00 P.M.
Pacific Time in the update later we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.

Let's take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been submitting their questions on say.com.
The first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell Technologies? What is holding that back?
"
310,TSLA,2019,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,10,"Thank you.
The second question is, is Tesla considering and creating an insurance program in order to further simplify the ownership experience and to more accurately take into account safety of driving an autopilot? The insurance market is very unreliable for Tesla owners right now.
"
311,TSLA,2019,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,11,"Okay.
"
312,TSLA,2019,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,12,"Great.
Thank you very much.
The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla only see it as an automotive company.
Can you speak to the energy side of the Company, specifically the roadmap for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenue for the Company?
"
313,TSLA,2019,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,13,"Thank you very much.

"
315,TSLA,2019,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,15,"And perhaps the last question from retail.
How soon should current owners that purchase FSD get the new FSD computer?
"
316,TSLA,2019,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,16,"Thank you very much.
Sherry, we can go to analyst questions in the question queue.
Operator
Thank you.
Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with J.P.
Morgan.
"
317,TSLA,2019,1,jonathan-chang,general-counsel,False,0,"Yeah.
Hi, it's Jonathan Chang, General Counsel here.
Right now, it is going through approvals with the SEC.
There is not a whole lot of things holding it back.
We're on schedule, we're on track.
Right now we're looking to close in mid-May.
"
318,TSLA,2019,1,jonathan-chang,general-counsel,False,1,"Yeah.
That was fun.
So, yeah, we'll start production next year.
The location is not yet set, but it's pretty clear that we make all the batteries and drive units in Reno.

320,TSLA,2019,1,daniel-v.-galves,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hey, thanks everybody.
A couple of questions.
One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for North America Model 3s.
Can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments? Is that what you're kind of seeing as order flow? I'm sorry, ASP is in kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
"
321,TSLA,2019,1,daniel-v.-galves,wolfe-research,True,1,"That's really helpful.
And the follow-up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way.
So, the -- I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades.
But on Model 3, whatever your assumption is within the 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is for Model 3, does your current order flow support that, or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?
"
322,TSLA,2019,1,daniel-v.-galves,wolfe-research,True,2,"Okay.
Thanks a lot guys.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.

324,TSLA,2019,1,toni-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein-&-co.,True,0,"Yes, thank you.
Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital for about the last year, you sort of shooed it as almost an evil thing, and I think a lot of investors believe that the Company might be better served and its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base.
And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren't you potentially trying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic.
So, why not raise capital? And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn't do, or wouldn't do? And I have a follow-up, please.
"
325,TSLA,2019,1,toni-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein-&-co.,True,1,"So, does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near- to medium-term? And I hear you on the force and constraint, but I mean, growth does eat cash, especially in a capital-intensive business, and if you really do believe you have a first mover advantage, why wouldn't you want to push it as quickly as possible even if it meant raising capital in the short- term?

"
328,TSLA,2019,1,colin-rusch,oppenheimer,True,1,"Okay.
And then as you look at the Maxwell Technology integration, post close, how quickly do you think you'll be able to integrate that technology into the battery production? And could you comment on potential for chemistry and form factor changes as that gets integrated?

335,TSLA,2019,1,alexander-potter,piper-jaffray,True,0,"Hi, guys.
I was wondering when you say, obviously, the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
When you talk about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their deliveries and you're going to try to emphasize more North America in order to, I guess, boost your working capital and your profitability in every quarter going forward?
"
336,TSLA,2019,1,alexander-potter,piper-jaffray,True,1,"Okay.
That makes sense.
Then the second question, I guess, on go-to-market, there were some period of time there where the Company was focused on closing storefronts.
A fair amount of noise made around that.
And then it looks like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy.
I was just wondering if there is any update there.
If you have on that, that would be helpful.
Thanks.

"
340,TSLA,2019,1,maynard-um,macquarie,True,1,"Okay.
And, I guess, there was some concern out there that Model 3 was cannibalizing S and X, despite them being all different vehicle classes, and it doesn't sound like you're saying that at all, but I was just wondering if you had any evidence that proves, or disproves this? Any thoughts there would be helpful.
Thanks

342,TSLA,2019,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hey, thanks for the call.
My first question is really on the Model S and Model X.
And Elon, you said, you're comfortable with them.
You see -- based on what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units per quarter is the level of demand that is where you see the market coming back already or are we not there yet? And more specifically, in the US, the pull forward in Q4 probably hurt a lot of demand for S and X.
Is it that something that we still see in the numbers today in recent weeks or is that behind us? And I'll have a follow-up on Q2.
"
343,TSLA,2019,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"Yeah.
My question was about like the run rate of demand you see at the moment, do you still feel like weak demand in the US because of the pull forward in Q4, or do you think demand returned to normal already?
"
344,TSLA,2019,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"Okay.
And then my second question was briefly on the...
"
345,TSLA,2019,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,3,"And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with 90,000 to 100,000 units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am surprised you don't -- you just still expect a loss.
So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a profit for similar volumes? How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off cost, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much is related to pricing and other things?

So, this is Vaibhav.
So, the purchase obligation in the 10-K is basically for the entire contract, which we have for Panasonic.
It's not something that we need to hit.
I mean, make the purchases tomorrow.
So this is going to take a couple of years.

353,TSLA,2019,1,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking our questions.
First one, on customer deposits, it looks like it's essentially flat to maybe slightly down.
I understand it's probably some timing with deliveries that could have helped it toward the end of the quarter.
But we would have thought it would have increased given the Model Y in there.
So, our question is what was the initial order intake for the Model Y? And just coming through some of your comment earlier, what daily order rate are you seeing right now for the rest of your products?
"
354,TSLA,2019,1,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,1,"Okay.
Well, then my second question would just be, if you anticipate a further price adjustment with the next level US credit phasing out July 1?

356,TSLA,2019,1,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
Your guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 2Q deliveries when combined with the full-year outlook.
It suggests somewhere between 35% and 45% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth? And in particular, what the order book or reservation list may be telling you?
"
357,TSLA,2019,1,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,"Okay, thanks.
And then my follow-up.
I'm sorry.
This concern on previous call you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont because it was -- I think you said, packed to the gills.
I heard today that it is now a close call between California and Nevada.
Is anticipated demand for Fremont built vehicles less than was previously thought or have you managed to maybe find more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production method?

360,TSLA,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Thanks.
First question is really just a clarification on -- in the outlook of 25% non-GAAP gross margin that you're targeting.
Is that over the mid-term or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year? And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?
"
361,TSLA,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"Okay.
And the second question is just looking at the 10-K, you've noticed $4.9 billion purchase obligation, which I think is primarily related to Panasonic Giga 1.
And then Elon, in some of your communication, you've indicated production constraints.
So, I guess, the question is, does that $4.9 billion correlate to reaching that 35 gigawatt hour rate? And if you can't hit that because of production constraints, does that adjust?

363,TSLA,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,3,
364,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah.
Thank you, Martin, and thank you, Elon as well.
Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the Company, and it was ambitious even by Tesla's own standards.
The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the quarter.
We launched the standard range lineup for Model 3, product retooling for Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about with the range enhancements and suspension upgrades, and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we'll open it up to Q&A, around cash and profitability for the quarter.
First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance.
But this reduction is attributed to two factors: the first is that, we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1.
Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.
The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas.
And the two components to this which we have discussed is that, an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
We do not expect to repeat in Q2, and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward.
I'll also note that we are tracking in April to the largest month of deliveries from month one in the history of the Company.
On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.
This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then US local builds in the second half.
This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China, and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries toward the final couple of days and weeks of the quarter.
So, we are addressing this by regionally on balance -- by building regionally balanced, and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
The secondary benefit of this is that, it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
So we don't have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the peak.
We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustment that flowed through to net income.
A $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28.
This included a reserve for potential increased return rate for our residual value guarantee and buyback guaranteed vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service loaners.
There is an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that, automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately to 20%.
This is due to two factors.
One is, the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28, as well as the mix shift toward the standard range lineup which we launched.
We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions, which offset this impact.
Labor content, warehousing and scrap are the examples of a double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.
In S and X the impact on margin was more significant.
Two major pieces here, the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin, as well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28.
Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continued to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon's sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
From a financial standpoint, what we've effectively done here is, built an incredible base of knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
So Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
As we noted in the letter, CapEx per unit of capacity is 50% per Giga Shanghai as compared to Model 3 in US, and that 50% are internal forecast that we're executing against is actually better than that.
In Model Y, as we've noted, is built on the Model 3 platform.
So we're able to leverage the knowledge there for capital efficient expansion.
In energy as well, as we've noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage.
So a lot of exciting improvements coming there, and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we've made investments in that.
So just to conclude the opening remarks here, personally I never felt more excited about the future of the Company, so looking forward to discussion.
Questions and Answers:
"
365,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
Well, just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on the production side of S and X.
We did reduce production in Q1 as was noted.
That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension, and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2.
So, just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and then return back to a more normal volume in Q3.
It's already increasing.
"
366,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yeah.
No, I think you summarized it well, Elon.
Two other things that I would add.
One is that, we did make pricing adjustments to our products in Q1, which puts pressure on margin.
And so, that's part of what we will see in Q2.
The teams are working extremely hard and making terrific progress on improving the cost efficiency of the business without sacrificing growth, and that in combination with the efficiencies from unwinding the wave is where we feel we will be comfortable returning to a place of profitability in Q3 once all of those pieces are in place.
"
367,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"And also, not only 3.5% of our trade-ins for Model 3 are coming from Model S.
So, it's from all the Model 3 trade-ins, Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.
"
368,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, this is Zach.
I mean, what we saw on February 28 when we launched the standard range, the standard range plus variances is that, there is pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
And then, as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it's starting -- the average ASP has actually been increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
And just under $50,000 ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it's starting to stabilize there.
And we'll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we're seeing in North America is that, over 50% of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs are far good enough.
"
369,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Just to add to that, the journey we've been on for the last 12 months to 18 months on being more efficient and how we spend money has really changed the culture inside the Company.
It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements in operating expenses as well.
And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European facility, our CapEx per unit of capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here.
So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.
"
370,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"And we're filling the ship 100%...
"
371,TSLA,2019,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
This is Zach here.
That's what we're targeting for the end of the year, although internally, we are working toward S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner.
The biggest lever there is actually two components.
One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there is just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us.
But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we're executing on over the course of the year.
And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we're seeing an increased take rate on our full self-driving offering.
And there are revenue deferrals associated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there.
And as that option becomes -- approaches feature complete, then we roll out more, and we will be able to have more revenue on that.
And so, all of these things together within our internal plans gives us confidence.
"

373,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Martin.
On Monday, we hosted our first-ever Autonomy Investor Day, showcasing our new in-house designed full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles.
All Tesla cars being built today have all hardware necessary for full self-driving and over-the-air updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think it's somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year.
In some cases, perhaps more.
We are the only Company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries, as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving.
We're in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robotaxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
We believe we'll have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps the -- yeah.
Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America experienced last year, as well as the massive increase in delivery volume to China.
As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.
This was the most difficult logistics problem I've ever seen and I've seen some tough ones.
So, I'll say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced -- half of all deliveries occurred in literally in the final 10 days of Q1.
As a result, a large number of vehicles -- the vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which, of course, net -- Q1 net income to be negatively impacted.
As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers physically in time.
In response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle booked throughout the quarter.
This will make the -- this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the US, outselling the runner-up by almost 60%.
It's worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made several years ago.
There are literally -- to the best of my knowledge zero predictions that this would happen, if you go back just even five or six years ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the US.
And we believe overtime we will be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.
And, in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
Since the introduction of standard range, a standard range class, only 70% of previous Model 3 have actually been non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model 3.
So -- and keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the US.
We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to accommodate the next generation of powertrains.
So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X, as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 kilowatts, which is -- and there are number of other small changes.
If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody has an -- is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get the ludicrous upgrade for free.
So this is -- yeah, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
So, they have a longer range.
The Model S now has a range of 370 miles.
This is actually be a range of 370 miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds, and they said they could have even gone faster, and they were any headwind as well.
So, this is a pretty remarkable that an electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California.
I mean, I have never -- back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station.
This is literally better than a gasoline car with rare exception.
And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way.
And we are able to do this without increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team, and for -- being able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X, as well as continued expansion of Model 3 globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production levels.
And in terms of other (ph) production, very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will fundamentally transform transport as we know it.
The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version 3 on the energy side.
And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the world.
And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
"
374,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Jonathan, do you want to...
"
375,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,2,"That was Sparks technically.
"
376,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
Northern Nevada.
"
377,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,4,"I think the -- from features and functionality standpoint, I think there's no point getting the FSD upgrade, if you don't really have it in the car for probably about two or three months, that's when we'll start releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the Version 2 hardware.
So no need to rush to the -- to get your computer replaced, it's like two to three months before it becomes relevant.
And then it will, obviously, increase rapidly from then.
One other comment I made -- I'll make in case, since somebody asked this explicitly.
For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada.
And we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.
But in the meantime, we've ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y.
So, we do not expect this to in anyway delay production of Model Y.
But it's currently a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options.
And we'll hope we got to make a decision in the next few weeks.
"
378,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
The -- we do see strong demand for vehicles, the -- both S, X and 3.
The standard range plus Model 3 with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the US and Europe.
So, it's -- I think we'll see a lot of interest and demand in that.
We are.
And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade and this really is kind of a game changer of an upgrade.
So I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that be quite significant.
So -- and we're also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don't like buying cars in winter and we're getting past the overhang of the tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the US on December 31.
So these are all very positive factors.
We also have just a lot of markets where there is a -- where we haven't yet tapped into demand, especially for Model 3.
So we will be releasing the right-hand drive Model 3 and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive countries.
Overall, I feel really good about where things are headed.
"
379,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Well, first of all, obviously, on account of tents, like I mean, real like hardcore tents, so I am not like Cub Scout tents, which are fine.
But this is actually -- credit goes to a number of Tesla team because they actually looked at how could we do this in Fremont if we had to.
And we feel like we can actually append building space to the -- basically to the west side of the building and use a lot of internal space that's currently used for warehousing in the Fremont factory.
And so, we believe it actually can be done with minimal disruption to add Model Y to Fremont.
"
380,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
I mean, I think something like the -- returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand for S and X is what we anticipate.
That's to the best to my knowledge.
We don't have a crystal ball, but that's probably our best guess.
And sorry, what was the other point?
"
381,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,8,"I think we expect demand to -- we are seeing demand returning to normal in Q2.
And it might be a little better than normal.
It's -- I don't have a crystal ball, it's hard for me to say, but my impression right now is that demand is quite solid, quite strong, yeah.
"
382,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Sorry, Zach, would like to...
"
383,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Yeah.
Okay.
That's right.
(Multiple speakers) Part of the S, X.
Yeah.
S, X, yeah.
Or by an S, X.
Yeah.
"
384,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Sure.
So quite a bit -- we think if we didn't unwind or pulled the wave where we -- yeah, we made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America.
And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it's West Coast or East Coast, then we could deliver more cars.
But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just -- not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive Tesla team.
So, if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind this crazy wave of deliveries, and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave.
And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?
"
385,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Great.
Thanks.
"
386,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,13,"I think we are just going to continue to report the absolute numbers.
But I think reporting the detail just gives those who are opposed to Tesla, they sort of like data mine the situation and then try to turn it positive into negative.
So we are just going to keep reporting what we report.
We do give some more detailed information to insurance companies and to help with rates.
And, obviously, as we launch our own insurance product next month, we will certainly incorporate that information into the insurance rates.
So, we essentially have a substantial price and sort of arbitrage -- or information arbitrage opportunity where we have direct knowledge of the risk profile of customers and based on the car and then if they want to buy a Tesla insurance, they would have to agree to not drive the car in a crazy way.
Or they can, but then their insurance rates are higher.
So, we are just going to keep reporting the numbers at a broad brush stroke level, which I think is really what matters.
Autopilot...
"
387,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,14,"That's the safety.
Yeah.
"
388,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Well, mate, I don't want to surprise you, but I would prefer we were private, but unfortunately, I think that ship has sailed, so...
"
389,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Well, I mean, being public, does feels like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manic-depressive way.
And I think Warren Buffett's analogy is just like perhaps being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at the edge of your home and just randomly yell different prices for your house every day.
It's still the same house.
"
390,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,17,"So, it's a bit of a distraction at times, but I'm not sure what to do about it.
"
391,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Thank you.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.
"
392,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,19,"In Q2, we don't -- we think we have two supplier interruptions, at least there aren't any significant ones that we're aware of.
"
393,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,20,"No, they really do seem to be different market segments.
Yeah.
"
394,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Yeah, for sure.
We feel that Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.
"
395,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,22,"I think we'll be fine.
Yeah.
I don't think there is any major thing required.
"
396,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,23,"The answer is, yes, we are creating a Tesla insurance product and we hope to launch that in about a month.
"
397,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Yeah.
I mean, I don't think raising capital should be substitute for making the Company operate more effectively.
So that -- in that sense, I think it's just -- it's important to have strong financial discipline of the Company and just to make sure we don't have extraneous expenses and that we're just being frugal with capital.
If we keep raising capital every time, then it just take -- if we now have the forcing function for improving the fundamental operation of the business.
So, I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while.
At this point, I do think there are -- it is similar to raising capital.
That's a -- but this is sort of probably about the right timing, but yeah.
"
398,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Yeah.
First of all, I'll just say that I don't think that capital has been constraint on our growth thus far.
And if I thought there was a final constraint on growth, we would have raised capital before now.
But I think it is very important as the Company scales to make sure we are on a solid foundation and that we're -- we have the appropriate financial discipline throughout the Company and are spending money very efficiently.
At this point, I think we are doing that, but there is more work to do.
And Tesla today is far more efficiently operating organization than it was a year ago.
We've made dramatic improvements across the board.
And so, I think there is merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.
"
399,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,26,"And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $500 million.
So, that -- we want to make sure that we don't have to grow upon global capitals fund under the Shanghai factory.
"
400,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,27,"No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter and this put so much strain.
We don't want a situation again like we had in Q1, where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
We literally delivered half of the entire quarter's deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1.
That's insane.
So, I think we need to unwind that.
I suppose it's not a great customer experience because we're shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like people from -- like that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
And then we -- then they can't do their regular jobs.
So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.
"
401,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,28,"Sure.
I think Tesla just sort of -- specifically, I didn't handle messaging of that well.
The -- I mean, that's amplified by statement -- we're making statement as sort of taking to an extreme where there was a misunderstanding.
We certainly will continue to have stores, and we will continue to add stores provided they are in locations where there is high foot traffic and that are in our target market.
So, we actually will continue to add stores in locations that are no-brainers.
We will close stores in locations where they are incredibly hard to find and the foot traffic of potential buyers is very low, such that it does not support the cost of the store and the people in it.
So, I think it's just common sense.
And then all sales online just means that, even if you go into a store, you -- we would guide you to order the car on your phone.
So, the store is essentially like -- they are like information centers, a place you can get a test drive and buy some Tesla merchandise, that kind of thing.
But all sales online, doesn't mean all stores are closed.
It just means that when you buy a car, you always do it on your phone in the store or at home or anywhere.
You also -- orders online doesn't meant all stores are closing.
This is -- that's not what it's meant.
"
402,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,29,"I think it's a confidential deal with FCA, so we -- and we agreed with FCA not to comment on it publicly, so we must abide by that.
"
403,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,30,"I think that would actually be counterproductive because people read too much into what occurred in a month.
I mean, even at a quarterly basis, things can be lumpy.
And so, the more granularity that's provided, say, at a monthly level, the few would reach all sorts of conclusions that don't make sense.
It's like literally like sales to a particular country, say, overseas are affected by when the ship arrives.
And so, if the ship arrives on the 31st of the month or the first of the next month, this will make it look like something dramatic has happened.
But actually, the ship was just a day late.
So, people read -- that would increase the drama, not decrease it.
"
404,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,31,"Filling the ship 100%.
So it's like -- it just ends up being lumpy.
Yeah.
So, like if you managed -- if you've calculated like GDP of a country to offset the US, GDP on Sunday is extremely low, but GDP on Monday is extremely high.
It does not mean nothing has really changed.
"
405,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,32,"I think we don't want to comment on the granularity of deposits.
Again, people read too much into this.
We're not playing up the Model Y because we're not -- it's not in production.
So you can't really read anything into Model Y orders at this point.
"
406,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,33,"We don't comment on future price changes unless you see it publicly.
"
407,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,34,"It will be much more compelling than anything else out there.
"
408,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,35,"Self-constrained you mean? We don't anticipate being self-constrained at 400,000.
"
409,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,36,"I mean, you're really asking some super secret sauce questions here.
Yeah.
I think, we'll have -- I think we'll probably have an Investor Day like we have an Autonomy Day maybe later this year or early next just to go over the cell and battery technology and future strategy.
And I think that will be very informative, but we do recognize the criticality of this.
"
410,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,37,"Thanks.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
"
411,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,38,"Yeah.
I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually launched in a significant cost down because we essentially took the high volume rear-drive units of the Model 3, which is extremely efficient but (inaudible) magnet motor and power electronics and we made a version for that -- of that for the front-drive unit of the -- of S and X.
And so, we're actually able to get a cost reduction while improving range and performance of the car.
That's just one example.
"
412,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,39,"Go ahead.
"
413,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,40,"I mean, our goal, as we've been very clear about from the beginning of the Company is to make our cars as affordable as possible.
And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 and then to create a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we think actually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important, the more people realize in range and having posher premium interior and then bundling autopilot.
So, we thought this -- like we weren't -- like a product that's really just nails the sweet spot, which I think the $39,500 Model 3 is just really nail the sweet spot and we're seeing consumer response accordingly.
You can still by the $35,000 Version of the Model 3 that, of course, didn't have autopilot and has a software range restriction, that kind of thing.
It's like slightly more inconvenient to buy, you just have to make a phone call or visit a store.
So, it's just not like you have to complete the obstacle course or something.
But we see very few people actually take us up on that $35,000 offer, but it is there and will remain there.
"
414,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,41,"Yeah.
The Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well.
A testament to the outstanding execution of our team on the ground there.
I get daily emails with dozen pictures from one day to the next from Tom Zhu, who leads the Gigafactory program.
And so, we're obviously discussing it or getting updates seven days a week.
So, I mean, I'm in that Gigafactory email.
So, in terms of execution, it's outstanding, but of course, the production goes as fast as the slowest item.
That's very important to bear in mind.
So, we have 99% of things in good shape, but 1% is missing you still can make a car.
So, with respect to -- that said, it looks like we'll reach volume production at the end of this year with, let's say, more than 1,000 cars a week, maybe 2,000 from Shanghai Giga at the end of this year.
That's what it looks like to be the case right now.
If it's not at the end, it will be shortly thereafter.
And then, we expect to have multiple sales flyers for Shanghai Giga.
"
415,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,42,
416,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,43,"Sure.
The challenge really is battery cells scarcity.
As far as the stationary storage is concerned, we basically need an upsell to support the vehicle production, as well as to both Powerwall and Powerpack.
Last year in order to have enough sales for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for the Model 3 as opposed to Powerwall and Powerpack.
And so, we're essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to at least continue some level of production on the Powerwall and Powerpack.
This year, we think we'll allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell output, like, JB, like what do you guys think?
"
417,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,44,"Yeah.
Something like that.
"
418,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,45,"Yeah.
So there are far fewer cells in a Powerwall than a car, so that translates to -- it just, look, quite a decent number of our Powerwalls.
And then we will continue to use cells from a variety of suppliers around the world.
The Powerwall and Powerpack, because they don't have to go through vehicle homologation are much more adaptable to using a variety of cells from other cell providers.
So I would expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year.
Maybe on the order of 300% or some quite high number.
Sorry? Sorry? Yeah, 300%.
I guess, he's just confirming it, 300%.
So this is a very big percentage growth rate, that's much faster than automotive.
So over time, we will expect that to -- that sort of growth rate we -- hope we'll be able to continue and then battery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla's business over time.
We also have -- we are also planning a significant increase in retrofit solar this year because we've -- we believe we finally refined the product offering to be something that's extremely compelling and much more cost efficient to deliver and install.
So radically streamlined process from what has been done before.
And we'll have more to say on that possibly next week.
And then the Solar Roof tile, we're on Version 3 of the design.
That necessarily takes a while to scale up, because we have to be confident that the Solar Roof is going to last for -- on the order of 30 years.
And because of the warranties of 20, 25 years, and so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down by the (inaudible), which you can do accelerated aging on the roof.
And we want the installation process to be simple and easy.
So -- which is actually the Buffalo -- Tesla Buffalo factory a few weeks ago.
And I was pretty impressed with the team and we're looking forward to scaling that up significantly through the balance of this year and next.
"
419,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,46,"The prototype type is working amazingly well.
"
420,TSLA,2019,1,elon-r.-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,47,"We even use them to deliver some Model 3s.
"
421,TSLA,2019,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,0,"Thanks so much, guys.
Can you speak to the pricing strategy in light of the China price reduction, as well as the mission to increase EV adoption? Is there a target for gross profit or operating profit on a per-vehicle basis that we should be thinking about or how should we really frame that for ourselves?
"
422,TSLA,2019,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,1,"Okay.
And then just shorter-term, there's significant discussion in industry around moving to higher voltage on the Powertrain.
And then some challenges around the supply chain's preparedness to support that.
Separate from the battery pack, since we'll talk about that in a couple of months.
Can you speak to the areas of focus on Powertrain technology-driven cost reduction over the next 12 months to 24 months that we should be thinking about?
"
423,TSLA,2019,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,2,
424,TSLA,2019,4,daniel-galves,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hey, good afternoon.
Thanks.
So hoping you could give us some guidance on what capex is going to be this year? And kind of as I look to model out the business long-term, is there a rule of thumb that we can use for capital expenditures per unit of production capacity or some sort of rule of thumb like that?
"
425,TSLA,2019,4,daniel-galves,wolfe-research,True,1,"[Indecipherable] metric.
"
426,TSLA,2019,4,daniel-galves,wolfe-research,True,2,"Okay, got it.
Maybe I could follow-up.
I mean, your kind of operating cash flow, EBITDA is annualizing at $4.5 billion right now.
As I look out to the future, I'm kind of guessing that that could fund somewhere around 200,000 to 250,000 units of capacity a year, which would be maybe a 30% CAGR over five years.
I mean, is that something that's feasible for you guys to execute on, on a consistent basis a level of capacity building that large?
"
427,TSLA,2019,4,daniel-galves,wolfe-research,True,3,
428,TSLA,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
And actually agree, I think the retail questions were excellent actually.
So, Elon, do you see potential for Tesla vehicles to be fitted with user terminals that are compatible with the Starlink constellation in the near- or medium-term future?
"
429,TSLA,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Well, maybe just a follow-up -- for my follow-up.
How would -- assuming that we get the antenna form factor and cost down to a point where that could be integrated into the roof of a car, for example, cost effectively and aerodynamically, etc? How would compatibility with the Starlink architecture theoretically improve the Tesla customer experience or the capability of the network?
"
430,TSLA,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,
431,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,0,"Thank you, Sherry and good afternoon everyone and welcome to Tesla's fourth quarter 2019 Q&A webcast.
I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 PM Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
[Operator Instructions]
But before we jump in the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
Elon?
"
432,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,1,"Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.
"
433,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,2,"Okay.
So now let's switch to institutional shareholder questions.
The number one question is, you have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower capex per unit of capacity.
Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective? And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
"
434,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,3,"Okay.
The next question from institutional investors is, given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production, i.e., build the Gigafactories, investment in Supercharger and customer service?
"
435,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,4,"Okay.
The next question we've already answered regarding Autopilot timelines.
So, the following question would be, can we please talk about cost control and OpEx sustainability in terms of growth versus gross profit growth.
How did we achieve the recent OpEx trends and how should we think about OpEx needs as we grow both vehicles and geographic workloads?
"
436,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,5,"Okay.
And the last question from investors is the sales of Model S and X have stayed flat for several quarters, the main reason is that they still use 18650 batteries.
When will S and X use 2170 batteries? Manufacturing capacity of 18650 may be used for battery storage systems instead.
"
437,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,6,"Yeah.
And actually the Model S and X actually have more range than we are currently stating on the website.
We just haven't gotten around to updating the, I guess, the EPA sort of might number.
But the actual range of the Model S and X are above what the website says there are.
Yeah.
The existing cars that are being made.

We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by Say Technologies.
So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roofs installations in California?

Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the Tesla ride-hailing network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network.
If so when will this happen? Might want to target California airport first, also good place to add Superchargers.

The next question from retail investors is how many California owners are currently insured with Tesla Insurance? What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start to significantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will we get premium discount of certain percent?
"
455,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,24,"The last part of the question was, will there be a discount for using Autopilot with our cars?
"
456,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,25,"Thank you.
The next question is, you set expectations that you would be feature-complete on FSD by the end of 2019.
Can you please provide an update on when will we see this -- but with end users, where are you in retrofitting the FSD computer to older models?
"
457,TSLA,2019,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,26,"Thank you.
And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall.
Since most retail investors seem to understand Tesla better than analysts and are risking a larger part of their own personal wealth on Tesla.
Doesn't it make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us via Say? Do you even have to take questions -- answer questions from analysts?
"
458,TSLA,2019,4,gene-munster,loup-ventures,True,0,"Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you'll sell as many as you can make.
Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?
"
459,TSLA,2019,4,gene-munster,loup-ventures,True,1,"Great.
I'll look forward to that Battery Day.
Elon, you also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up and the only vehicle not announced for master plan part 2 is a high passenger density vehicle.
Any light that you can give us regarding that project?

461,TSLA,2019,4,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Hi, good evening.
Thank you for taking the question.
Just want to follow-up on the question on capital raise.
So given the cheaper cost of capital and this is a real competitive advantage for others, why wouldn't it make sense to raise capital to either pay down debt or to pursue acquisitions, especially bolt-ons that could help you accelerate capabilities in autonomous or battery technology?
"
462,TSLA,2019,4,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"Well, I -- given the importance of autonomous, I imagine that this is an area that you would want to accelerate, if you view it as a crucial competitive advantage.
"
463,TSLA,2019,4,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,2,"And debt pay down?
"
464,TSLA,2019,4,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,3,"Okay.

And in a world where self-supply is fueling growth like we're part of the fuel of growth.
I don't see a reason to turn that self-supply off, so.

472,TSLA,2019,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Thank you for taking my question.
Elon, I wanted to come back on batteries.
If I look at the end of this year, you should have 800,000 units in production capacity forecast.
So that's -- if you add to that Model S and Model X and then the energy storage business, it means you've been following north of 60 gigawatt hour of battery production capacity.
So, where do you stand now, and how do you get there? And then it looks like your competitors, or those who would like to compete with you, seem to be struggling to grow battery capacity.
So, if you can just take us through what you're doing differently? Why you're confident you can do that? And it seems like nobody else can.
"
473,TSLA,2019,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"Okay.

Thanks, Martin.
This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this happen.
On 2019 a few key points I'd like to highlight.
On demand, while we've mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again.
Over the course of the year we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno.
As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs.
And we're able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation.
We've also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million, driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to.
As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an important year for the company.
Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
On Model Y, we expect first deliveries and limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters.
As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
This year for the Shanghai built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the region.
This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally built Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs.
We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will result in continued increases in capital spending.
On operating expenses, I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and international footprint.
However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the Coronavirus.
At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown.
This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.
We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance sheet.
Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
Questions and Answers:
"
480,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"And then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow people to put their cars into ride sharing or the FSD network using Tesla Insurance.
It's not currently the case, but by the time that this is available, it's our intent to get that ready.
"
481,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"And I think we'll always find ways to become more capex efficient per unit of capacity.
And we challenge the teams to always become more efficient.
And so, we see reduction per capex -- per unit in terms of capex.
"
482,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"I mean, I think...
"
483,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah.
I think they're not -- I'm not sure the math that you've done, but I think our internal plans are faster.
And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on capex in the 10-K.
But back to the growth rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that, the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support that growth.
So that helps.
And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to continue to fund additional factory.
So, I wouldn't necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
"
484,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"And just to add to that, I think it's important to keep the Model Y launch in context over the next 18 months to 24 months.
We're working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have 3 and Y locally produced in all location.
"
485,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"And so, Model 3 is expanding as Model Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.
"
486,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"No, I think that's fair.
"
487,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"I mean, our order rate supports the pricing that we have right now.
We're working very hard to reduce cost and expand production because, I mean, we feel from the data it's pretty clear that there's a lot of interest in our products.
And so, we're working on is to increase production, increase availability of the products with time.
And the price reduction in China kind of the first step toward this global localization, more accessible price and we'll continue to work on cost reductions in China as we do in Fremont and grow production.
"
488,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"I would just say that focus is on cost on the Powertrain when we're thinking about technology innovations, it's how do we continue to drive the cost down.
"
489,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"And that's through voltages maybe one angle, but there are certainly others that just enable more power density and lower cost.
"
490,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"It's all about [Speech Overlap]
"
491,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Yeah.
So Tesla Insurance is currently available in California.
A couple of things that we're working-on on this front, the first is to expand it to other locations and we are preparing the regulatory processes, preparing our processes to go through the regulatory processes in those locations.
We're also working on the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also have to go through regulatory processes as insurance is quite heavily regulated.
And that's where we're spending our time focusing on Tesla Insurance right now.
There is a significant amount of innovation as we've discussed before in this space, exactly getting to the intent of what the question here is, using our technology to reduce rates and this will be rolled in over-time.
"
492,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"But I think the way you described, it is fair.
So, I mean, relative to the current Model 3, China Model 2 pricing is slightly lower.
And our Model Y pricing is public on the website.
So you can see that it's clearly slightly higher than what Model 3 is out of Fremont.
How the mix of those three products? And that's out over the course of the year, we'll see.
But I think it's probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those is fairly stable in terms of the ASP when you average them together.
"
493,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"I think the broader -- there's been a couple of versions of this question over the course of the call.
I think what we're saying more broadly is that, as we look forward on the cash generation from the business relative to what our plans are, we are not constrained.
"
494,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Yeah.
We were negative gross margin on the products that we built in Q4.
But the team in China, I think did a great job managing cost during the launch.
And so, there was a slight drag associated with it, but not terribly significant.
"
495,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"Thank you.

497,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,18,"Yeah.
The rate card for California Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated with Autopilot.
"
498,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,19,"Yeah.
The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model 3 there.
We have talked a lot about the capex [Indecipherable] that is capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense from the states.
Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we're not shipping cars from California over to China.
And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
And so if you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus that we're selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
And so and I've said this on previous earnings calls, I think it's fair to expect the margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
"
499,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,20,"And also on working capital.
"
500,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,21,"Or reducing OpEx here too [Indecipherable].
"
501,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,22,"Yeah, I completely agree with that.
I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch period where we grew too quickly and with too much complexity and it held back our ability to continue to scale and part of the journey that we've been on in 2019 is to underline a series of unintentional bad processes that kind of accumulated in the company over-time.
And so that's kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that.
And now we've laid a good foundation and I think and I agree with you on that we're not holding back on the growth.
I mean we have two products, two vehicle products launching right now and that will consume much of the bandwidth of the company to stabilize those over the course of the year.
And then looking into next year, we have even more products launching, more factories.
So we want to be smart about how we spend money and grow in a way that's sustainable.
So we don't fall victim to the mistakes I think we made a year and a half or so ago.
"
502,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,23,"I commented briefly on this in my opening remarks.
We did see an increase in operating expenses from Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that attributed to stock-based compensation.
And when you double click into that growth, it's supporting the Model Y program and also Shanghai program as well.
And so I think we as a company are now at the point where we've learned a lot on cost efficiency as I've just mentioned and we've unwound a number of the processes that were not in the right place including automating the things that need to be automated.
And we'll continue on that journey.
But I think we're at a point now where OpEx will start to tick up at least if you look annually from 2019 to 2020 to support our international footprint and then the growth of the Company.
It -- our job is to grow that significantly slower than the pace of growth of revenue to improve the operating leverage, which we're very, very focused on.
"
503,TSLA,2019,4,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,24,"It's actually been that way for some time.
"
504,TSLA,2019,4,john-segar,evercore-isi,True,0,"Hey, guys.
Thanks for taking my call.
I want to talk about the differences between the Model 3 and the Model Y beyond the sort of 10% rule of thumb, just around cargo and size.
Are there other features that are going to differentiate the two models? And then as a follow on to that, you've talked in the past about how Model S sales grew with the introduction of Model X.
So, are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y?
"
505,TSLA,2019,4,john-segar,evercore-isi,True,1,"All right.
Thanks, guys.

507,TSLA,2019,4,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Hi, good evening, everybody.
So, in your slide deck, you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in 2020.
Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like that metric evolve? Obviously, you have the Model Y, which probably would have initial higher pricing and then the China Model 3 is at a lower price.
So, I guess, what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like stable ASP in 2020?
"
508,TSLA,2019,4,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,
509,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Martin.
So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company.
Our deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter.
It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with zero advertising spend.
I think that's like where we do say that from time-to-time and I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without much of advertising.
At our Fremont factory we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006 and obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
This rate of production was cheap before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there's lot of potential to go beyond that number.
For the Shanghai factory, I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model 3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year.
I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
I think it's going to be an incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
Regarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got EPA rating of 315 miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just an incredible specs all around.
For the Cybertruck, a few months ago, we revealed -- obviously we revealed the Cybertruck and that was -- that went viral.
And we tried to build a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such product should look so and just that with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just an incredible specs all around.
For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went viral and we tried to build a product that is product superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such should look.
So it really just from the standpoint of what's the most bad ass, futuristic, all at personal carrier that kicks ass of any pickup truck basically that's the goal.
And we wanted to look like something that just came out of the site by movie set from the future and the amount has been incredible.
I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this -- we've never seen anything like it basically.
I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
So -- as many -- we'll sell as many as we can make, it's going to be pretty nuts.
So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don't have enough information to realize just be awesomeness of it, it's just great.
So and then stepping back in 2018 from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was break-even, but in 2019 we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y production.
So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think performance of the Tesla team and I'm just so proud to work with such a great team.
I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and that's what has allowed us to get to this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
And in conclusion when I think what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology.
We have full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably bunch of other products we'll come up with too.
It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years.
If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately 1,000 times more cars in 2020 than we produced in 2010, 8,000 and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit and Powerwall, Powerpack, all those things too.
So where we will be in 10 years, very excited to consider the prospect.
"
510,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Well, I think we do -- we are seeing mostly from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass Roof.
So it's difficult to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla Solar Roof, but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in North America on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
So, we see a lot of interest and so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation.
But over-time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something to use solar glass in one form or another.
It's really going to be your choice, do you want to roof that is alive with power or dead without.
And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it's the future we want.
So it will be a significant product but because it is a new one, quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will overcome and this will be a major product line of Tesla.
And the Buffalo factory is doing great, so yeah.
"
511,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Sure.
Go ahead, Zach.
"
512,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
I feel there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars than 3 and Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
It kind of makes sense.
But what we're doing -- or have been doing in the past was really pretty silly in making cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, you got tariffs, transport.
And then the factory complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex and just having a factory in China or a factory in California or a factory in North America and a factory in Europe will -- just that alone is a massive improvement in our fundamental operating efficiency.
That I think this may not be fully appreciated.
"
513,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yeah, absolutely.
"
514,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Well, we're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly.
So if there's any sensible way to spend money, we're spending it.
There is no artificial hold back on expenditures.
Anything that I see that is what looks like it's got good value for money, the answer is yes immediately.
But we're spending money I think efficiently and we're not artificially limiting our progress.
And then despite all that we are still generating positive cash.
So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level.
Zach?

515,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Yeah, absolutely.
"
516,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Sure.
Well, actually the core chemistry inside the 18650 cell has improved many times over the years.
So, it's really just a form factor as opposed to a core technology.
So it's -- yes, I think we're pretty happy with where the -- with the energy content of the cell and the improvements in efficiency of the vehicle.
The -- we're rapidly approaching a 400 mile range for Model S, for example.
So, this is -- it won't be long before Model S is 400 -- has 400 mile range.
Drew, is there anything you want to add to that?
"
517,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yeah.
I think we're -- yeah, it must be somewhere in the 380s or something like that for us, yes.
"
518,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Well, it's certainly something that could be happening in the coming years.
If there's no plans throughout this year, the folks of Starlink is really for high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity for homes and businesses, and I guess, aircraft and boats and that kind of thing.
But the antenna for that high-bandwidth, low-latency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on a car, but I think is more bandwidth than you would really need.
Technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car.
Yeah, it will work space for antenna.
"
519,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Well, I think it actually is most possible that we just use the cellular connectivity, just use 5G would be a recommendation, certainly, in like any cities or something like that.
But if you're out in the countryside and there's not good cell connectivity, then you could connect with Starlink antenna.
And you wouldn't need -- you don't need to like have like gigabit level or level of connectivity.
You can -- probably like 20, 30 megabits is probably fine.
And then you can have much more antenna.
So, yes, I guess, it could be good for -- yes, making sure there is connectivity and -- outside of major cities and that kind of thing.
But, I mean, that's a -- yes, sort of, I'd say, relatively obtuse.
It's not -- we're not thinking about it very much, to be honest.
"
520,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"I don't know if we wanted to tell you -- I don't think we want to say what our capex is going to be this year and certainly -- except to say that like -- as I said earlier, we're spending money as fast as we can spend money in sensible ways.
So it's definitely not artificially limited.
And we will spend -- well, a lot of money this year, for sure.
It's -- the challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actually deploy the capital, that's the harder part then sort of deciding on a capex number, really.
"
521,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Sorry, it sounds like more question in one.
"
522,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Absolutely.
"
523,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Yeah.
It's good.
Yeah.
I think there's so much at Tesla where the core technology is improving radically that maybe you wouldn't necessarily notice as an end customer.
Or some of them, you would notice.
Some of them, you wouldn't, but it's just there are these things that you have a big effect on the efficiency of the Company like our internal applications team that kind of builds the Tesla internal operating system and improves the sort of core automation of the Company, that makes a big difference to our productivity, but you wouldn't necessarily -- you would see it effectively in healthier financials, but you wouldn't necessarily notice that as an end customer.
"
524,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"We're having for more than 30%, yes.
"
525,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Yeah.
I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our [Indecipherable] a few years ago, I said in my estimate, for us is that, Tesla would grow at an average compound annual rate -- average rate of in excess of 50%.
I still hold to that belief.
"
526,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"Yeah.
I think we don't comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, three or four years, something like that.
So, the thing we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that's very fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one product to another and you haven't actually produced more electric vehicles.
So, that's part of the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available, then -- and say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model 3 or Model Y cars.
And so, we've got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries.
This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
So that -- I said we're going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this and what our plans are.
I think probably it's going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it's going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges are, how do you get from here to, I don't know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
"
527,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Yeah.
Going back to what I just said that the -- we got to improve the total battery capacity.
Otherwise, we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road.
So, while we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars that that we've already got already on our plate.
And it's just generally true when I see some -- I think sort of sensible comments by our ARK invest, whether they're pointing out that really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves.
And like the average -- yes, I mean, the average number of occupants in a car, I think is like 1.2.
And maybe with autonomy, maybe they'll go to 1.4, maybe, but I'm not sure if that -- it even goes there.
So, yes, well, it makes sense just for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of Sprinter-like van at some point, probably but like I said, we got to solve this battery -- we got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today.
That's the real problem.
"
528,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"We're not quite sure what's going to happen with -- but it is true that Model X -- the introduction of Model X actually increased Model S sales because people would come in and look at the Model X and they like said, OK, I'd prefer the Sedan.
And we're worried that X sales would cause S sales drop, but it actually caused it to increase.
So, from -- like I said, we're not too worried about demand.
We're worried about production, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volume production as soon as possible with Model Y.
And it's hard for -- it's always hard to predict what that S -- the exponential part of the S-curve of production.
Our production pretty much always follows those S-curve or it's kind of like a herky-jerky S-curve.
And you can -- it's easy to predict what it's going to be like in the beginning because it's low and it is easy to predict what it's going to be like at the end, but that intermediate portion of the S-curve is very difficult to predict.
So that's -- and it involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise.
So, yes, I think we're just -- yes, go as fast we can with Model Y and make sure it's a great product.
I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but not -- it's not something we want to talk about in this call.
And I think -- so when they do -- when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I think they will be impressed about some of the things they see.
"
529,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Yeah.
"
530,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Yes.
"
531,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,22,"Yeah.
I mean, we're trying to make the cars as affordable as possible, as fast as possible, while maintaining reasonable -- while still being at least a little bit profitable and growing the Company like crazy and having good free cash flow and accumulating our cash balance.
Zach, anything you want to add?
"
532,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Well, I think it's -- probably will make sense to have like to enable car sharing in advance of the kind of sort of drive robotaxi fleet because the car sharing can be done before Full Self-Driving is approved by regulators.
So it's probably something that we would enable before sort of robotaxi fleet is enabled.
And, it sounded like there were some other questions bundled in there.
"
533,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Yeah.
"
534,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Yeah.
I mean, the thing that's really going to -- I think, probably just have a profound effect on our financials is like is high-volume and high-margin, obviously.
And that high-margin part comes from autonomy.
So, do people buy the Full Self-Driving package or not? And do they buy it worldwide or only in certain places? For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is in the US.
So fewer people -- a very small percentage of people buy the FSD package in China.
But as we fix that, then we will see a much higher people -- percentage of people buying.
And as we're close to Full Self-Driving, that is just going to become more and more compelling.
So that's for our financial standpoint, that's the real mind-blowing situation is high-volume, high-margin because of autonomy.
"
535,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,26,"Well, Powertrain is pretty damn good.
I mean, it's way better than anything else out there by a country mile.
It's worth noting, for example, at the -- the Model S has like 100 kilowatt hour pack, but Taycan has 100 -- like 95 kilowatt hour pack.
The Model S is steadily approaching 400 miles range, the Taycan has 200 miles range.
So, we must be using that energy pretty efficiently and the Powertrain is a big part of that.
"
536,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,27,"Yeah.
"
537,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,28,"Looks like Powertrain is like mind-blowing I think.
Yes.
Coming out later this year, end of the year, probably, that's our goal.
Get the Powertrain out end of the year.
And then it's going to be like -- this is like alien technology.
It's insane.
"
538,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,29,"I didn't even think we could do -- yes, I mean, honestly, I thought there was no way.
I guess, we got the engineering team.
Tesla is about hardcore engineering.
"
539,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,30,"Making the price better and better.
Increase the value.
We don't want to really comment on prices and such.
I think we'll adjust according to what the demand looks like.
I mean, like right now it's pretty good, maybe that will change, who knows.
And yes.
"
540,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,31,"Yeah.
I mean, the affordability of our car in China improved radically because of very -- tariffs mostly gone away, purchase tax exemption, local cost supply, not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the ocean.
So, the affordability is 90-day [Phonetic] for our car in China.
"
541,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,32,"I mean, if you know of any acquisitions, we'd love to hear about them.
Yes, sure.
Sounds great.
Who should we acquire?
"
542,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,33,"We're not aware of any one that we'd want to acquire.
"
543,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,34,"Sure.
Yeah, probably we'll have Superchargers in airports.
We will have Superchargers wherever we see that there is a need for Superchargers.
"
544,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,35,"Diluting the company to pay down debt doesn't sound like a wise move.
"
545,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,36,"Yeah.
We're going to pay down the debt just as time goes by and we paid down $0.5 billion worth of debt last quarter.
So, we'll just keep steadily paying it down.
And yeah, so, yeah.
But, yes, I don't think we have any more say on that part, really.
"
546,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,37,"Well, I guess, a lot of people sort of made fun of us for not like being able to build cars and build capacity.
And it's like now it turns out actually even the pros have trouble with it.
It's pretty hard.
So -- but the fact is, we've already demonstrated massive growth in cell production capacity at our Gigafactory in Nevada.
And we have to go from the cells to the modules to the pack.
So it's not just cell capacity but also module and pack capacity.
So we've just gotten pretty good at that.
And we've worked well with key partners like Panasonic.
The Panasonic relationship has been excellent.
They've been a great partner with us for many years.
We've added some additional partners that are small at scale with LG and CATL.
And we'll have more to talk about this in detail in Battery Day, like I said probably April, we've got a very compelling strategy.
I mean, we are super deep on cell -- super deep, cell-through battery, so cell module battery.
Drew, anything you want to add to that?
"
547,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,38,"We are super deep.
"
548,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,39,"Rabbit hole goes down pretty far.
"
549,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,40,"Yeah.
We did seven days a week, yeah, battery production.
Man, do we know a lot of batteries? Geez.
"
550,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,41,"Yeah.
Absolutely, and how to manage the cell and the module and the battery and through different weather conditions and different terminal and different charge regimes.
And wow we really know about a lot about batteries, yeah.
So next level.
"
551,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,42,"Well, like I said, we're going to talk about this in Battery Day, which is probably April.
And then a lot of these questions will be answered.
I think it's going to be a very compelling story that we have to present.
I think it's going to actually blow people's minds.
It blows my mind, and I know it.
So it's going to be pretty cool.
"
552,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,43,"It's an important piece of the puzzle, yes.
I think like some of the sort of retail investors have managed to put together several piece of the puzzle, they have the most insight.
"
553,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,44,"All right.
You're welcome.
"
554,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,45,"Yeah.
I mean go ahead, Zach.
"
555,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,46,"Thank you.
"
556,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,47,
557,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,48,"Yeah, there will be.
"
558,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,49,"Right.
But I think it would make sense for us to close-loop on higher use of Autopilot, it reduces the insurance costs as well as the probability of injury.
So I think insurance is going to be I think quite a major product of Tesla over-time.
The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is like a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car, like you can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying sort of between $100 and $200 a month in insurance.
So we're talking about something which is maybe a quarter or two half of the cost of the lease of the car is insurance.
And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don't have good information about the drivers and that there is no good way to provide feedback where it's a very poor feedback mechanism in terms of the insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven, whereas we can do that in real time.
It's a fundamental information advantage that insurance companies don't have.
"
559,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,50,"Well, I mean, to be precise, I said I was hoping it would be feature-complete with both FSD by the end of last year.
We got pretty close.
It's looking like we might be feature-complete in a few months.
The feature-complete just means like it has some chance of going from your home to work let's say with no interventions.
So, that's -- it doesn't mean the features are working well, but it means it has above zero chance.
So I think that's looking like maybe it's going to be couple of months from now.
And what isn't obvious regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving is just how much work has been going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy.
The -- like the core autopilots in Tesla or Autopilot software and AI team is just is I think very, very strong in making great progress.
And we're only beginning to take full advantage of the Autopilot hardware and the FSD hardware.
So I think it's -- the apparent progress, as seen by consumers, will seem to be extremely rapid, but actually what's really going on my head it seems like that is just having the foundational software be very strong and we've got really strong foundation.
And then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training.
So in terms of labeling, labeling with video in all eight cameras simultaneously.
This is a really, I mean in terms of labeling efficiency, arguably like a three order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency.
For those who know about this, it's extremely fundamental, so that's really great progress on that.
"
560,TSLA,2019,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,51,"Well, I guess, we don't have to -- I do think that a lot of retail investors actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and certainly better insight than many of the analysts.
It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smart smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, you would probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions.
"
561,TSLA,2019,3,edison,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Hi.
It's Edison [Phonetic] on for Emmanuel.
Thanks for taking our questions.
First, there's been a lot of activity in the industry about electric pickups lately.
Just curious if you have any updates, anymore insights you can share on the one that you're about to put out later? And then, secondly, there was a comment I think earlier about the order book quarter-to-date.
Can you just clarify what was the baseline? And any insights about the geographic mix of that? Thanks.
"
562,TSLA,2019,3,edison,deutsche-bank,True,1,
563,TSLA,2019,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Hi.
Good evening.
Thank you for taking the questions.
First, just wanted to ask a question on Giga III.
You're targeting 3,000 units a week.
But we saw with Fremont that the ramp on Model 3 was lumpy.
And you sort of ramp and then sort of cut production to fix the bottlenecks.
Given this is a brand-new capacity, how smooth should we expect production to be on a week-to-week basis? Meaning, once you hit the 3,000, is that 3,000 you could go every single week in a quarter or is it still going to be lumpy within a quarter?
"
564,TSLA,2019,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"I'm looking for it.
"
565,TSLA,2019,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,2,"Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
And then, just a follow-up.
You mentioned -- Elon, you mentioned earlier in your comments that one of the things you're optimistic on in the future is Tesla Energy, and I think we understand the part that one of the challenges in the past was sort of a reallocation of resources away from Energy to the Auto side.
Could you just talk to where you see the greatest pockets of growth in Energy, is it Solar or Storage? And now that you can reallocate resources, what would that entail in terms of capacity? Or what does reallocation of resources look like?

"
567,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,0,"Thank you.
First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible job this quarter.
The execution was outstanding and -- on just about every front.
So it's just an honor to work with such a great team.
Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter and we had record deliveries, we're able to make great strides and controlling our costs.
We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generating strong free cash flow.
And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their part to reduce cost.
Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.
Regarding Gigafactory, Shanghai, this month we started with trial production at Giga Shanghai and built four [Phonetic] vehicles from body, to paint, to general assembly.
So this is a -- more emphasis this is [Phonetic] a real factory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it.
While a lot of people see the outside show the factory, which is enormous, and it was essentially under water in January.
It was below the water table literally.
What is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massive stamping machines, fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in the same period of time, in parallel with bogue building I'd like to thank our transient for this extraordinary achievement I'm not aware of any factory of this magnitude in history being constructed in such a short period of time, approximately 10 months.
As far as I know, this is unprecedented.
And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a template for future growth.
We're planning to build model-wise in Shanghai as well of course, and build a Gigafactory in Europe and we hope to announce the location to that Gigafactory.
In fact, we will announce the location to that Gigafactory before the end of this year.
Regarding Model Y, we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont, and we've moved the launch timeline from full 2020 to summer 2020.
There may be some room for improvement there, but we're confident about summer 2020.
I've actually recently driven the Model Y release candidate and think it's going to be an amazing product and be very well received.
I think it's quite likely to -- just my opinion, but I think it will outsell Model S, Model X and Model 3 combined.
Regarding the Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month we released our latest Software Version 10, which includes video streaming games karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features and improvements.
Most importantly, it includes the first version Smart Summon, which has now been used 1 million times.
So, it's now over 1 million uses of Smart Summon, and in the next week or so we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon taking into account all the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts.
So, this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet, because it allows us to collect these corner cases and learn from them, and use street learning and become rapidly better just as Navigator and Autopilot did on the freeway.
So, expect a number of improvements in Smart Summon in the weeks to come.
And this is really just the beginning as we collect more data and Autopilot and Full Self-Driving functionality get better.
I do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in early access release of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving feature this year.
So, it's not for sure, but it appears to be on track for at least an early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving by the end of this year.
And yeah, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to the company, such as opening Gigafactories in other continents.
Yes, it's worth noting that these geared ultimately having three Gigafactories effectively will triple out our output.
And then when you consider increased output per Gigafactory, it's going to actually more than triple our output over time.
And then, there are a lot of interesting things happening with respect to advanced batteries and more efficient powertrains, and full self-driving and all that sort of stuff, but that will be something for a future time.
And then, one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.
That's the integrated solar panels integrated with the roof.
So that's -- I think this is a great product.
Version 1 and 2 where we're still sort of figuring things out.
Version 3, I think, is finally ready for the big time.
And so we're scaling up production of the Version 3 solar tower roof at our buffalo Gigafactory.
And I think this product is going to be incredible.
But we'll talk more about that on the official product launch, which will be tomorrow afternoon.
"
568,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,1,"Actually, if I may interject.
What a lot of people don't realize is, in California and in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or solar rental, there's no money down, and you instantly save on your utility bill, and there's no long-term contract.
"
569,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,2,"I mean, yeah.
"
570,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,3,"I think [Indecipherable] also like the single truck roll -- yeah, single visit install is a big deal.
We're taking it from where the solar industry would often be three visits before the solar was installed and would often take a lot of time to do the installation.
But we've streamlined all of that to the point where in many cases it's a single visit to do everything, and it's fast, minimized disruption to the homeowner.
And ordering solar is literally one click.
You can order solar for you house in less than one minute.

"
572,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,5,"Yeah, what we're seeing is that word of mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess of production.
We have no plans to advertise at this time.
At some point in the future, we may do advertising not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure they are aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace in advertising.
"
573,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,6,"I think there is generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking about.
In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla's automotive sector or business.
This is the most underappreciated group.
I think it could be bigger, but it's certainly of a similar magnitude to Tesla Solar.
Meaning, if you take Tesla Solar plus battery stuff, Tesla Energy is, I think, the least appreciated element.
And part of it is like, for about 18 months, almost two years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources.
We had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model 3 production -- fixing the Model 3 production ramp and simplifying the design of the Model 3.
So, for about a year-and-a-half, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and even took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car because we didn't have enough cells.
Now that we feel that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla Solar and storage.
And so that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into the future as I can imagine.
And but we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, Tesla wouldn't survive.
So unfortunately, that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company.
But it would be difficult for me to overstate the degree to which, I think, Tesla Energy is going to be a major part of Tesla's activity in the future.
And Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, that means sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles, electric vehicles.
And I think one of the stats we will publish in the future along with our vehicle production is that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced, or Tesla customers produced with our products.
And I think you'll see that we're producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as are consumed in the car -- in our cars.
Because for the longest time, the rebuttal against electric cars is like, don't they use dirty power from coal? Well, no, we're solar power.
Obviously the solar power came from companies, not just Tesla.
Yeah, sustainable generation and sustainable consumption, and that's what we're doing.
And we'll do more of it.
"
574,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,7,"I think we'll continue to sell it in a bundled fashion.
I mean, any Tesla that you buy already has basic Autopilot included.
So, I think that's -- that really is a pretty major advantage relative to other cars.
But then, the next step will be full self-driving with Smart Summon being kind of the beginning of that.
And obviously, we kind of have the two sides of it -- highway Autopilot and we've got Summon which is sort of low speed in parking lots and that kind of thing.
Now we need to work on solving the intermediate portion which is traffic lights and stop signs, and navigating through windy roads and -- windy narrow roads in suburban neighborhoods.
That's the focus right now.
You're going to want it all.
That's the answer.
Something everyone is going to want for sure.
"
575,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,8,"And as I said before, at the point which we're able to upload the software enabling a Tesla to become a robo-taxi, expect to have that from a functionality standpoint by the end of next year.
In terms of the functionality -- basic functionality aspirationally end of this year but reliable enough that you do not need to pay attention in our opinion by the end of next year.
And it would need -- the acceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction.
But that transition, that sort of flipping the switch from a car that is from not robo-taxi to robo-taxi, I think, will probably be the biggest step change increase in asset value in history by far.
"
576,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,9,"Well, we've talked about the launch time.
What really matters is the timing to volume production where volume production is some number in excess of 1,000 units per week.
And we're confident of reaching that point no later than the middle of 2020.
Yeah, so from an interest standpoint, we do not expect it to interfere.
Yeah, the body line is separate, the paint line is -- basically we do not expect it to interfere with Model 3.
No, we do not expect any downtime.
From a margin standpoint, Zachary, do you want to add anything? [Phonetic]
"
577,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,10,"Sure.
DeepScale is a very tiny company.
It's basically about 12 people, and they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a given amount of compute, which I think is helpful.
So it remains to be seen, but the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, slightly accelerate FSD.
That is the intent, and hopefully that will turn out to be true.
Yeah.
"
578,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,11,"Yeah, we're in trial production of Model 3, basically sending cars through the system, and we're ramping rapidly.
We're expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.
The second building is indeed for battery and module production.
And there's probably -- there's obviously a bunch more construction beyond what is already there because obviously we need to build out more facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.
"
579,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,12,"So, it's kind of a no-brainer.
It's really, do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't print money, we'll fix it or take it back.
It's kind of a no-brainer.
And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here which is effectively to become a giant distributor global utility...
"
580,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,13,"Yeah, I think it also has a secondary effect of insuring that the third-party providers of insurance provide reasonable rates to our customers.
"
581,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,14,"Yes.
Exactly.
"
582,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,15,"Yeah, feature-complete, I mean, it's -- the car is able to drive from one's house to work, most likely without interventions.
So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive -- it will fill in the gap from low-speed autonomy -- low speed autonomy with Summon.
You've got high-speed autonomy on the highway, and intermediate speed autonomy, which really just means traffic lights and stop signs.
So feature-complete means it's most likely able to do that without intervention, without human intervention, but it would still be supervised.
And I've gone through this timeline before several times, but it is often misconstrued that there's three major levels to autonomy.
There's the car being able to be autonomous, but requiring supervision and intervention at times.
That's feature complete.
Then there's -- and it doesn't mean like every scenario, everywhere on earth, including ever corner case, it just means most of the time.
And then, there's another level which is that we think it's -- that from a Tesla standpoint, we think the car is safe enough to be driven without supervision.
Then the third level would be that regulators are also convinced that the car can be driven autonomously without supervision.
Those are three different levels.
"
583,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,16,"Yeah, I think there's -- it would be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies with electric vehicles on the battery and powertrain front, possibly on other fronts.
So it's something we're open to.
As a lot of people know, we open sourced our patents so that those would not serve as an obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage.
And we're definitely open to supplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies.
"
584,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,17,"Well, the goal for the infotainment system is to say what's the most amount of fun you can have in a car, which I think -- I don't think other car companies really think about it that way.
But certainly, what is the most fun -- how can we maximize the enjoyment of a car such that it's not some just some sort of transport utility device with no soul and no character.
We want it to be fun and entertaining, a reverence, something that you love.
And so, [Indecipherable] there's a lot one can do because people are generally spending a couple hours a day on average in their car, and so that's pretty high percentage of their waking time, outside of like showering and going to the bathroom and that kind of thing.
It's a lot of time.
And I guess, maybe there's some way to monetize it, but we haven't really thought about it that way.
Our goal is to just make -- say what is the most fun you can possibly have while you're in your car.
And obviously as autonomy gets better and better, that is going to become much more of an entertainment opportunity.
So we'll see where that leads, but that's what we're after.
That's our goal.
"
585,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,18,"We certainly have ongoing dialogues with OEMs, but as you see from our financials, the tax credits or emissions credits are not forming a very big percentage of our revenue.
They're -- I mean, Zack, what was the last quarter? It was really quite...
"
586,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,19,"But out of like several billion.
So it's like 1.5%.
It's not -- it's not exactly a giant percentage.
And obviously there's credits in the US are really not -- the credit situation not particularly strong for obvious reasons, which we think is not great for the future, but anyway that's the way it is.
In Europe, there's much more of a sensitivity to the environment, but we're not counting on some big windfall, maybe it will be good, maybe not, we don't know.
But we're not counting on it.
"
587,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,20,"It's obviously a good thing to do that would help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy for sure.
But it's -- and I think outside the US, there seems to be a strong push in that direction, which is great.
And probably within the US, that over time will become a strong push.
"
588,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,21,"Yeah, we're not -- I think we've said enough about the Tesla Cyber Truck.
We're not going to -- this is not the right forum for us to do product launches.
But I think it would be -- I mean, my opinion, and this could be totally wrong.
I could be totally out to lunch here, but I think the Tesla Cyber Truck is our best product ever.
That's my opinion.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And demand is not -- it seems to be strong.
We should be production constrained this quarter.
"
589,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,22,"Yeah, absolutely.
We want to get the Tesla volume to where it is perhaps somewhere on the order of 1%, replacing 1% of the global fleet over time.
That's, I think, the global fleet is pretty big.
We think that's a good one to aim for, which is about 20 million vehicles a year, just by the way.
But I do think that the demand for new cars will rise as the world transitions away from combustion engine vehicles, just as when people had CRT TVs, there's no cathode ray tube TVs, the sales rate was just basically replacement rate.
You wouldn't really buy a new CRT TV unless yours broke.
But when flat screens came out, there was a big step change in demand because now getting a big flat screen TV was much better than having a small CRT TV.
I think we'll see the same thing with electric vehicles, which is that instead of people just buying a car just because their last car wore out, they'll buy an electric car because they're fundamentally a better car, and especially if it's got self-driving.

594,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,27,"They're great cars.
The Model S I think if you want -- I mean, the Model S literally won Motor Trend's best car ever in history by the way.
I think if you're out there and you're buying -- and you're going to buy a Model S, I think you just made a mistake, to be totally frank.
It's incredible, especially the new one with variable damping suspension, hospital operating room, HEPA filter for air purification, the raven powertrain.
It's the fastest car in the world, and it's just so easy to drive.
It makes you feel like Superman driving that car.
It's incredibly safe.
It's just an amazing vehicle.
And then, Model S, I think, is like Faberge egg of cars.
I mean, not Model X.
Model X is like the Faberge egg of cars.
Yeah, that's why so many artists and musicians buy the car.
It's an art piece basically.

Actually, technically it's 373, but we actually certified it incorrectly as 370, but it's 373.
And there are some software improvements that we think will make that even better.
I forgot to mention, we're also expecting there's going to be an over-the-air improvement that will improve the power of the Model S, X, and 3.
That's, by the way coming in a few weeks.
Should be in the order of 5% power improvement due to improved firmware.
Drew, do you want to say anything on that?
"
596,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,29,"Yeah, and there's also the single pedal driving that will improve the range as well.

And then, there's an interesting study by Zillow and a number of other organizations that show that adding solar to your home increases the price -- increases the value of your home, and the Zillow study showed a 4% increase in the value of the home with solar.
And then, if you add sort of the Powerwall, which gives you blackout protection so you'll have energy security in the event of rolling blackouts or if the power goes out for any reason, which appears to be a long-term systemic issue in California particularly, that I think is definitely going to be viewed as a significant asset for any home.

But -- and I think if you look over a reasonable enough time frame, the production will actually be fairly smooth.
But from a week to week standpoint, it obviously will not be.
It will be about as smooth as, say, the stock market.
How smooth is the stock market from one week to the next? But if you just extend the time period to, say, two or three-quarters, it will be very rapid steady ground.

608,TSLA,2019,3,elon-r.-musk,"founder,-chief-executive-officer-&-director",False,41,"Well, I think, on a percentage basis, Solar will grow the fastest, but Storage will also grow higher on a percentage basis.
I think both over time will grow faster than Automotive.
They're starting from a smaller base.
I think, especially if you look at sort of -- if you look at like year-over-year growth, it will be absolutely incredible, I think.
From one quarter to the next, there might be some fluctuations due to seasonality or some short-term parts shortage or you name it, but over the course of, say, a year, gigantic increase.
Also, with Solar, it's hard to install a lot of solar in the winter, especially on the East Coast.
The roofs are full of snow and ice.

Sorry for that.
So, I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X.
It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the deliveries of the previous quarter and that Model 3 has indeed cannibalized the demand for these cars, quite a big deal.
So how are you thinking about these two models going forward? What's the strategy you have in mind? And I have a quick follow-up on the Model Y.
"
630,TSLA,2019,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,3,"Okay.
That makes sense.
And then, my question...
"
631,TSLA,2019,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,4,"Yeah, just a quick one on the Model Y.
So, I was wondering what you have learned with S and X that make you think maybe when you launch Model Y, you have some cannibalization of demand on the Model 3? And have you started to think about that and how to approach it?

This is George Dailey on for Adam.
So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model 3 sold in China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?
"
634,TSLA,2019,3,george-dailey,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Great.
And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it's been over seven years since you launched the Model S.
And many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don't even offer one right now.
As your business model proves to be more sustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with batteries or software or complete electric vehicle architectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable transport?

641,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,5,"Okay.
And the last question from retail investors.
There is skepticism regarding your comment that the full self-driving will be feature-complete by year-end, like resulting from confusion about feature-complete, what feature-complete means.
Could you please talk to this and perhaps give us a list of features that establish the FSD baseline?

652,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,16,"Thank you very much.
So first we're going to take some questions from say.com.
We will then take questions from both institutional investors as well as retail investors.
.
Questions and Answers:
"
653,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,17,"So, the first question from institutional investors is, what are the opportunities for Tesla to create demand? Is word of mouth still sufficient or should we expect to see Tesla commerce advertising in the near future.
"
654,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,18,"Okay.
The next question from institutional investor is, Elon, other than robo-taxis and autonomous vehicle capabilities, when you look over the next three years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you believe investors don't understand or have missed?
"
655,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,19,"Okay.
Thank you.
The next question from investor is related to full self-driving attach rates.
Given that self-driving regulations will evolve unevenly in different markets, would you consider selling modules individually? For example, navigate an Autopilot or Summon versus current strategy of selling the package as a whole in order to encourage adoption and getting more data?
"
656,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,20,"Okay.
"
657,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,21,"Okay.
Thank you.
The next question is, with respect to Model Y, what is your latest expectations for launch timing? Do you anticipate any Model 3 production downtime at Fremont during the launch? And how should Model Y gross margin percent look compared to Model 3 gross margin?
"
658,TSLA,2019,3,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,22,"Okay.
Thank you.
And the last question from institutional investors is, can you provide an update on FSD package attach rates? As FSD attach rates improve, will you let the financial benefits manifest in higher gross margins for company and shareholders or will you lower the price to drive delivery volume?
"
659,TSLA,2019,3,kunal-girotra,"senior-director,-energy-operations",False,0,"Hi, everyone.
My name is Kanal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about four years working on different aspects of deploying our energy products.
I now run Tesla Energy's deployment and fulfillment teams.
Over the last three months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our Solar and Energy Storage businesses.
As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 50% over last quarter, and our energy storage deployments, which include Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by 15% to an all-time high of 477 megawatt hours.
In the last three months, we relaunched Tesla Solar in North America by simplifying our solar offering into three sizes of small, medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.
"
660,TSLA,2019,3,kunal-girotra,"senior-director,-energy-operations",False,1,
661,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah, thank you, Elon.
Thank you, Martin.
Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla.
I know many employees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work.
We've made terrific progress, and yet again, we realized margin improvements in nearly every aspect of the business.
There are three key points I would like to highlight.
First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided by improved gross profit, reduced operating expenses and the absence of negative one-time items that weighed on our financials in the first half of the year.
GAAP automotive gross margin improved sequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits.
We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on Model S, Model X and Model 3, enabling better fixed cost absorption.
We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as other costs such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import related items.
We are also making continued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.
Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimited supercharging.
And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly, driven by mix in Asia, pricing action in EMEA.
North American ASPs held flat as mix improved, offsetting pricing action we took at the start of the quarter, which is great to see.
Note that with the release of Smart Summon in the US, we were able to recognize $30 million of deferred revenue.
As we expand Smart Summon to additional markets and release new features, we will continue to recognize additional deferred revenue.
Our services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to improve efficiency of this area of the business, and we further reduced operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveries and new programs in development.
And finally, on net income and other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange, which as I mentioned last quarter, we don't hedge.
The second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cash flows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in capex spend.
This has enabled year to date positive free cash flows for the company.
Our cash balance increased by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter with our highest quarter-ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion.
Specifically, on captive leases, we've received a number of questions on how these are funded.
We use our leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for captive leases without material use of cash.
What's important to note here is that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow, and as a result, leases negatively impact free cash flow.
This impact was material in Q3 as the lease rate increased substantially by 50%.
In addition, capex spend increased, driven primarily by Gigafactory Shanghai and Model Y spending.
We've received a number of questions on why our capital spending appears low compared to prior levels, even though there are multiple new projects launching and in development.
As we noted in the shareholder letter this quarter and last quarter, this is because we've made great progress on improving our capital efficiency.
My third and final point is around demand and growth.
Our global order rate remains strong and continues to increase.
Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing, and quarter to date orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.
In the immediate term, we're focused on increasing production of Model 3 and Model S and Model X as quickly as we can.
The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment.
We've also made targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand.
Our pace of execution on these factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly.
As Elon mentioned, the first phase of Gigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we've been able to pull in the timeline for other major projects.
Overall, we are quickly turning the corner for our next phase of growth and our financial health continues to strengthen.
We remain focused on reducing cost which enables rapid investments in future programs and growth.
"
662,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Right.
"
663,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yeah, so all these improvements have led us to speed up our customer order to installation timelines from months to, in many cases, days.
As Elon, you already said, we've added the option to add Powerwalls to secure people from future power outages and home installed Powerwall -- as was shown in the recent California outages, many homes ran successfully.
Unidentified Participant
Yeah, you can tell which homes have a Powerwall because that's where the lights are on.
Look at the neighborhood, it all but a few lights are out, and there's usually the ones with the Tesla Powerwall.
"
664,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
"
665,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, and then we have done the same thing in the commercial solar space.
Nobody thought of putting a simple left side with prices for commercial solar.
We do that now, and we've seen a good response from small businesses wanting to go solar.
And by removing the complexity of long-term contracts and simplifying the terms and conditions, a commercial solar sales process would typically take six months is now taking a couple of weeks.
So the same thing that we have done in residential, we want to expand more and more in commercial as well.
So all in all, the roadmap for energy products from solar, Solar Roof, Powerwall to Megapack is superexciting, and I expect Tesla Energy to become a larger part of our overall ecosystem as we leverage and integrate the same competencies from our Vehicle business.
The future is pretty exciting for Tesla Energy.
"
666,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah, from a margin perspective, we're expecting ASPs for Model Y to be slightly higher than they are for Model 3, and this is common in the industry between sedans and CUVs.
The part that we've worked very hard on is controlling the cost of Model Y, and our steady state forecast for that program puts the cost at roughly equivalent to Model 3.
There will be ramp in efficiencies at first, of course, as we launch the program, but as it stabilizes with steady state production, we do expect that it will be a higher margin product.
It's something that we're very excited about within the company.
"
667,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"I don't think we're going to need to lower the price of FSD.
I expect the price of FSD to increase slowly as the functionality and capability improve.
That's -- that is unchanged.
Anything to add on to that? I mean, our cash gross margin obviously is higher than our GAAP gross margin because of unrecognized revenue associated with FSD attach rates.
So that's why I think it's in the order of $600 million or in the order of $0.5 billion of unrecognized revenue.
So if you were to include that, which is obviously recognized as we release the full self-driving functionalities, the actual gross margin we're operating in on a cash basis today is higher than the GAAP gross margin.
"
668,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah, I can take that.
So far, we've launched Tesla Insurance in California.
I have to say that I'm quite pleased by the results so far.
The take rates as measured by quote-to-purchase conversion are quite high by industry standards, and we expect that this will only increase as folks understand the products better and receive some of the known price increases coming from some of the standard carriers that they'll come to us and look for an alternative.
There's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly the purchase flow, to make sure it's the best product experience for our customers.
And we're also working very hard to get other states lined up in the States, and then also to launch in some countries internationally.
So we're not able to provide specific timelines on those changes, but we're definitely working as quickly as we can, given how well received Tesla Insurance has been in California.
"
669,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Completely agree.
The goal here is not to have an outsized market share of insurance, it's just to make sure that their customers have an alternative to other companies, as well, if those rates are high.
I mean, ultimately what makes the most sense for a total cost of ownership perspective is for folks to have good pricing on their insurance.
"
670,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah, I can provide a couple of comments on that.
On your final -- on your last question about China headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory.
So we don't expect China to be any different than that.
So there will be some that we experience in Q4.
The amount of that is hard to forecast, given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here in Fremont.
We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly fixed cost absorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.
On the margin improvement, a couple of things there for Auto gross margin.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3.
I mean, that's important, as I mentioned in the last earnings call.
The prior powertrain versions of S and X provided significant headwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.
We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricing on our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand.
And so, I think there is a bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which we allude to in our financials.
And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us.
It's hard to underestimate how much of that has been engrained in the culture of the company.
And Jerome and his team have done absolutely tremendous work there.
So, on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing, labor, warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.
Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I'll note, one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition, debatable whether that's considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release revenue associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out specifically and the dollar value around that because we know there's been speculation around the impact for the quarter.
And foreign exchange is just something that since we don't hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and goes every quarter.
So we'll have to see as the quarter plays out the effect that that has.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
"
671,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"That one is also difficult to forecast, it's a good question.
At least based on the plans that we have now, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremont factory.
There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down.
And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering.
So I think just for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of the Fremont facility.
"
672,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"It was over $100 million.
"
673,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Yeah.
"
674,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"Yeah, I think that's a fair way to characterize it.
I mean, our expectations are that credit revenues will generally increase with time, not necessarily increasing every quarter.
We did increase from Q2 to Q3, but there's a certain amount of them that are baseline based on the number of cars that we build and deliver, and there's others that are deal specific, and those deals can happen at any point.
So we're constantly in conversations with auto makers about this, but within the company, we manage the business without counting on any profit or cash flows from regulatory credits, and we view it as purely incremental.
And my recommendation is that everyone should feel it that way.
It's just an extra that comes through.
"
675,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"Yeah, that's right.
The baseline from the comment earlier that I made was looking at this point in the quarter in Q2, and order rates are strong, I would say, in all markets.
I think we're very encouraged as a team at the reception of our products as more and more people become aware of electric vehicles.
I think competitive products help raise that awareness, and overall interest is just increasing.
So our focus internally is to increase production as fast as we can both with the existing equipment and accelerating our timelines on new capacity.
We believe that everybody should be driving an electric car, so we need to move as quickly as we can.
"
676,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Yeah, just to add -- I agree.
They're absolutely phenomenal cars.
And we are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand.
And so, I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, that's kind of consumed a lot of the attention around the company.
But now as that has stabilized, we're able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model 3.
So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter.
And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in Q4.
"
677,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"And we're not stopping to work there.
We'll continue working on these developments.
"
678,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,17,"Yeah, the best comparison we have for that is when we launched Model X and we had Model S at the time.
"
679,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,18,"Yeah, and we didn't see any cannibalization there.
"
680,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,19,"Yeah, so that's the best comparison that we have.
"
681,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,20,
682,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,21,"Yeah, absolutely.
The subscription solar offering that you mentioned has launched in six states, and like you said, it's six monthly payments and no long-term contracts, and the response from customers has been pretty awesome so far.
"
683,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,22,"Totally, yeah.
Yeah, I think to your point of buying Tesla Solar is easy because we have one of the lowest prices in the nation now, in the country, and just a little bit of story there.
We were able to lower our prices because our cost of acquisition is now less than a quarter of any typical solar company.
"
684,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,23,"Yeah, we do online sales, online orders...
"
685,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,24,"Totally, yeah.
Yeah.
That's great.
On solar, we've also simplified the fulfillment process with a goal of really fast order to install timelines.
We've done many residential installs with a single related to a customers' home because of the reduced complexity.
We've also been working with cities and counties to submit generic permits that follow a template rather than customizing for every situation, because...
"
686,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,25,"Totally.
Yeah, around 350 cities and counties have accepted it.
"
687,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,26,"Many more coming.
"
688,TSLA,2019,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,27,"Yeah, yeah, we have a lot more small cities and counties that have to come online, but that will be our focus in the coming days.
And it's more important as we scale Solar Roof too.
For all our deploying energy products, we need the innovation in the bureaucracy space that you said as well.
"
689,TSLA,2019,2,daniel-v.-galves,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,0,"Hey, thanks very much for taking the questions, and congrats on the $5 billion cash number.
I'm halfway expecting to some headlines tomorrow if Tesla's got too much cash on the balance sheet.
I was wondering if you could update us on Gigafactory China.
We don't have a great sense of what delivery volumes in China are for Model 3 at the moment.
Some sources are around maybe 3,000 or 4,000 per month.
What have you seen in terms of order flow and demand since you announced pricing at a local product that gives you confidence that you can get to 3,000 per week type of demand in that market?
"
690,TSLA,2019,2,daniel-v.-galves,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,1,"Okay, and sounds good.
And have you considered potentially sourcing cars to Europe from that China plant at all?
"
691,TSLA,2019,2,daniel-v.-galves,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,2,"Okay.

693,TSLA,2019,2,edison,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Hey, it's Edison in for Emmanuel.
Just first question on the guidance.
I know previously, there was a target out there of 25% kind of on S/X and Model 3.
Just wondering is the updated one, is that suggesting that that's no longer in place for the year or kind of what are the implications with today's update?
"

"
697,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,2,"Yes, just like efficiently factory both Fremont and Giga is like just the rate of improvement, which is not slowing down has been incredible.
It's like you're just like you can feel it and see it.

699,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,4,"I remember it well.
And maybe just to add a bit more to that, I'm not disappearing.
And as far, to make sure that people understand that this is not, not some lack of confidence in the company or the team or anything like that, it's as I love the team, I love the company and I always will.
So Drew -- Drew and I worked close together for many, many years, and I have total confidence in Drew and not going anywhere, if there's anything I need to do to be helpful to Drew or the whole team or any of the ongoing projects.
So yeah, I mean, I'm actually really happy with how we've kind of phased in transition.
Some of these different projects and people in and I feel like this is a super good process overall.
Drew, you want to say anything?
"
700,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
And I'm excited to stay involved in some of our core technologies and all that and help where I can, just in less of less of an operational, obviously, less -- not executive type role.
"
701,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,6,"Good year.
"
702,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,7,"It was -- the technology was ready.
"
703,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,8,"Yeah, they did some pioneer work.
"
704,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,9,"Yeah, I'll just add to that.
I agree completely.
I'll add is that generally speaking within the Model 3 lineup, the pricing adjustments for our higher trim cars were slightly more than that for the Standard cars.
So the -- so we'll see how the data plays out on this, as we've taken more orders, but the expectation is that our mix will move toward higher trim to some extent, offsetting some of the ASP adjustments from the pricing changes.
And one other thing I'll add is that, we are focusing on a couple of markets as well to target intensify some of our sales.
And so some of our pricing adjustments reflect those elements of that strategy.
"
705,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,10,"That's correct.
"
706,TSLA,2019,2,jeffrey-brian-straubel,co-founder-and-chief-technology-officer,False,11,"Yeah, generally on ASP as we noted in the letter, it was roughly even over the course of the quarter, stabilized around $50,000 and we have good visibility into our ASPs are going based on order data.
So that gives us one to two months of lead us to where our actual recognized ASPs will be.
And so I would expect some adjustment to our Model 2 ASPs, as a result of this pricing change.
But the trim mix will offset some of that.
And we continue to make great progress on cost efficiencies.
And so overall in that, our expectation is that the Model 3 gross margin will continue to grow.
"
707,TSLA,2019,2,colin-w.-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co-inc.,True,0,"Can you walk us through the plan for battery sourcing in China? How many -- how much of the supply is going to come from internally produced batteries? How much is coming from externally? And what's your expectation around cost per watt hours as you start to ramp?
"
708,TSLA,2019,2,colin-w.-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co-inc.,True,1,"Okay.
And can I have a follow-up question around Model S and Model X saturation? Obviously, you guys have some ideas around how big that market is? How should we be thinking about sustainable volumes and pricing on those volumes? Obviously, we're seeing some lower numbers here, and I think that's a core element of what's going on with the story that as we see pricing drop and volumes drop, what are the right numbers to think about you guys from a planning standpoint in terms of sell-through on both the Model S and Model X?
"

710,TSLA,2019,2,daniel-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Hi, great.
Thanks for taking the question.
I wanted to ask about your reg credits, in particular, the non-ZEV piece.
You're not disclosing the ZEV piece anymore, but just a couple of questions on this.
First, how can we think -- is there any quarterly cadence to think about this? And then what's the composition of this? Is this going purely to European OEMs? There's obviously one automaker that you've agreed with.
I don't know if there any others that you're looking at? And lastly, to what extent can you or are you willing to sacrifice pricing in Europe to sell higher volumes to generate more reg credits? And are you having discussions with other automakers on this front?

So we have some first questions from our retail shareholders from say.com.
And the first question is, it has been stated that Tesla is supply constrained not demand constraint.
Can you help us shed some light on why the slight is lowering car cost is supplies constraints?
"
728,TSLA,2019,2,martin-viecha,"head,-investor-relations",False,8,"Thank you very much.
The second question is many of us who follow Tesla closely are incredibly excited about a battery and powertrain Investor Day and its technology implications.
Can you provide us any more detail on when this will be and what will be covered?
"
729,TSLA,2019,2,martin-viecha,"head,-investor-relations",False,9,"All right, thank you very much.
The next question is, you stated on the Q4 2018 earnings call that customer service was a personal priority for 2019.
Can you update us on what has been done to-date to ensure that all owners are receiving an industry leading customer experience?
"
730,TSLA,2019,2,martin-viecha,"head,-investor-relations",False,10,"Okay.
The next question is, in April, Gigafactory one had efficiency of about 23 out of the 35 gigawatt hours theoretical capacity.
Has this been improved yet? And does Tesla still sell constrained? Are there any near-term plans to increase the plant theoretical capacity?

735,TSLA,2019,2,joseph-osha,jmp-securities-llc,True,0,"Hello.
Listen, listening to you talk about mix here and the fact that you're running a single shift your S and X facilities in Fremont.
I'm wondering is there maybe some potential to reconfigure the floorspace there a bit? And is that something that you're thinking about?
"
736,TSLA,2019,2,joseph-osha,jmp-securities-llc,True,1,"And just as a follow on then, could we see you manage to make 8,000, 7,500, 8,000 Model 3s in Fremont by the end of the year, you think?

739,TSLA,2019,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hey, thank you for taking my question.
I'd like to ask you, Elon, about distributions.
So you may like -- you guys made a big change at the beginning of the year, going from like an almost 100% on line distribution model, you tried to push back on test drive and get people to buy the car, try it and return it if they don't like it.
So could you give us an update on how it is progressing? Do you see this start becoming mostly like an online distribution on -- following an online distribution model? And I saw you opened 25 new retail locations in the quarter, so how do you see your retail footprints evolving over time?
"
740,TSLA,2019,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"All perceived.

742,TSLA,2019,2,a.m.-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein,True,0,"Yes, thank you.
I was wondering if you can comment about whether you felt that Q2 benefited from consumers in the US sort of rushing out to buy Model 3 in advance of the declining federal tax credit, a phenomena that you sort of saw in Q4? And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my analysis, it looks like maybe 70% of the Model 3 sold in the quarter were in the US, which is sort of higher than your normalized percentage of US sales.
And so do you feel that, that phenomena may have occurred in Q2? And are you still confident that Q3 deliveries can improve sequentially? And beyond the data point that you provided on the call that the orders quarter data better than last quarter, is there anything else you can point to that provides that confidence?
"
743,TSLA,2019,2,a.m.-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein,True,1,"If I could just follow up.
Elon, I'm wondering if you can comment on whether you believe Model 3 is having any cannibalization impact on as S and X sales or why you think that -- or why else there might be sort of a structural step down in the demand and delivery levels relative to what we've seen over the last five or six years?
"
744,TSLA,2019,2,a.m.-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein,True,2,
745,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thank you.
So last quarter we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is a record for Tesla.
Put that in perspective, it's nearly an 80% increase in deliveries compared to the second quarter of last year.
I think it's -- you said a heartfelt to appreciate, when you have a large manufactured item with the complex global supply chain.
Just how difficult that is, I'm incredibly proud of the Tesla team for being able to do that.
I think this level of growth is -- I possibly unprecedented might be the fastest that any large complex manufactured item has grown in history.
So just really great work by the Tesla team to achieve that outcome and we expect growth to continue in the future at -- for several years to come at the 50% to 100% level.
So it's like drilling think that is not well appreciated how to put this growth at that rate.
So in -- achieving record number of deliveries is an important milestone and shows the rapid progress we've made in managing a global logistics and delivery operation at high volume.
And as I've said all this was achieved, thanks to the tremendous hard work of the entire Tesla team.
Model 3 was once again, the best-selling premium vehicle in the US, that's only all of its gas-powered equivalents combined.
In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premium competitors and it was awarded a five-star ratings in euro and cap earlier this month.
This is in addition to Model 3 receiving an overall five-star rating in the US from NHTSA and including earning five stars in every category and subcategory, and achieving the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested.
Motor Trend also recently selected Model S as the best vehicle they have ever tested in their 70 year history.
Across all other cars.
So Motor Trend which is arguably the -- that the leading authority in evaluating vehicles, the Motor Trend Car of the Year is the most coveted award, it's -- is pretty credible that they would say that Model S in their try 70-year history is the best vehicle they have ever evaluated.
So this is despite Tesla not buying any advertising in Motor Trend and I think speaks to their journalistic integrity that's something special.
So -- and -- since the vehicle that they evaluated, we've actually made tremendous advancements in both Model S and Model X, including our recent update of a new suspension with active adaptive damping and all new drive train, that's capable of 370 mile range in the Model S and a 325 mile range in the Model X.
We also issued numerous software updates and improvements that have made Model S and Model X faster, safer and added dozens of new features.
Just like Model 3, Model S and X have the hardware needed for future of full self driving capability.
As we look ahead to the rest of the year and into 2020, we remain focused on launching new vehicle as new programs further expanding our manufacturing operations and continuing to improve customer service.
We remain focused on international expansion because local production is essential to being cost competitive.
By the end of this year, we will -- we expect to be producing Model 3's in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai and as you can see from the photos in our quarterly letter, equipment installation there is progress -- progressing well.
We also have to finalize location for our European Gigafactory before the end of the year.
Here at Fremont preparations for Model Y production has already begun, since Model Y has high component overlap with Model 3, it should be -- and we expect it to be a lot easier to ramp.
It's something on the order of three quarters of all the parts are coming Model 3 and Model Y.
And we expect manufacturing cost Model Y despite additional content to be approximately the same as Model 3.
This quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and add more than 100 mobile service vehicles to our fleet, and although our fleets at our total Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12 months, which is like again, just kind of a crazy thing to consider that's Tesla is almost doubling all cumulative production every year.
This is a -- this is totally mad thing to make as many cars in the year as we made in our entire history and have that be an ongoing trend.
I think it's difficult for people to really feel an exponential, so we didn't evolve to feel an exponential, we can feel linear, but we could only understand an exponential at a covenant level.
But Tesla is expanding at an exponential rate.
And in fact, if you look at the Tesla cumulative deliveries chart like year-over-year cumulative deliveries it's is about the cleanest exponential graph I've ever seen.
So obviously, if that trend continues results I think are going to be pretty amazing.
And I think that will continue.
So we've been able to improve service considerably and you can imagine that if -- obviously if -- if we're doubling our fleets every year, managing service, it is quite difficult.
It's like the total -- because service scales as the, not just with new production, as the total fleet scales -- service needs to scale and we want to scale our service in a way that's sensible from a cost standpoint, a bit better that the -- it's really quite a difficult challenge to scale.
Nonetheless, we've made massive improvements in service, especially in parts waiting time -- time to wait for parts and collision repair and we've in-sourced, a great deal of the collision repair activities, which has --how do I think quite a good effect on customer happiness.
And this will continue in the months to come.
So it's a very important milestone and we believe, Tesla has is now at the point of being self-funding and we expect the cash flow -- free cash flow positive in future quarters with the possible temporary exceptions around the launch a ramp of new product.
From a profitability standpoint, we expect to be probably around breakeven this quarter and profitable next quarter.
So that's feel pretty confident about that.
And then in terms of deliveries, we expect deliveries to be between 360,000 and 400,000.
We expect production to be slightly higher number than that and demand to be slightly higher numbers than that.
So if you go often confuse, deliveries, production and orders for Tesla and they're actually three different numbers.
So yeah, you obviously cannot deliver more then you make, so typically you will make more than we deliver.
And then the demand generation activities kind of move -- kind of like a -- if it -- to get together with production like -- it doesn't make sense to put a lot of effort into demand generation, if production can't meet the demand.
So what has happened is that we'll solve the production issues and so -- OK, we need to increase demand, address demand then it may increase production, the increased demand.
And like its [Indecipherable] get caught up in these details, a lot, but if you look at the actual results, like I said, look at cumulative deliveries over time for Tesla, cleanest exponential we've ever seen, extrapolate that curve.
So there is a trend not to be excited about at Tesla and we'll have more share in the coming weeks, months.
Zach is there anything you'd like to say about our results?
"
746,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Yes, I think, so important update is JB Straubel, our Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, will be transitioning to a Senior Advisor from the CTO role and Drew Baglino will be taking over most of JB's responsibilities.
I'd like to thank JB for this fundamental look rolling and creating and -- and building Tesla.
Thank you, JB.
"
747,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Sure.
There is a number of things to consider here.
The -- there's really two key dimensions for demand is value for money.
And then there is affordability.
If somebody simply does not have enough money to buy the car, it doesn't matter how much the value and how good the value for money is.
You could have money, so it does not have the funds to buy the car, they simply can't get it.
So this is just very important to parse those two.
And I think there's like it does [Indecipherable] by our cars, but people, obviously -- if they don't have enough around, they cannot.
So we have to make the cars more affordable.
And the effectively, like in the US, our cars got almost $2,000 more expensive with the expiry of the tax credit on July 1, or partial expiry.
And we only drop the price of the The Standard Range Plus Model 3 by $1,000 or actually -- yeah, $1,000.
So the base Model 3 actually got a $1,000 more expensive, which seem like a reasonable compromise.
So that's, yeah -- that's actually, I mean, sometimes just have you sort of pretty notions like if the amount is high, can't charge any price, like you cannot charge any price.
I think making a cars more affordable is also fundamental part of the Tesla mission.
So anything you want to add?
"
748,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Yeah, essentially that we expect average selling price to be the same within a few percentage points.
"
749,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yeah.
"
750,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yeah, on the gross margin point like the -- like full self driving is just an extremely important part of the larger calculation and the features for full self driving are only as portion of them have rolled out.
So the revenue recognition on the full self driving option is limited at first, until those futures roll-out and also the demand for full self driving packages limited because the features are mostly prospective instead of current.
But as those features roll-out, I would expect the take rate for full self driving to increase significantly as well as the recognition -- revenue recognition full self driving to obviously match the roll-out of the product.
So the gross margin over time, will be really quite compelling when factoring in the full self driving option, which is, yeah, kind of to 7k in mid-August and that's number will increase over time.
"
751,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Yeah.
Before have battery day, we're going to do a comprehensive review of cell chemistry module and pack architecture.
And manufacturing plan that it has a clear roadmap to a terawatt hour per year.
The time is probably is about six months like maybe February or March next year.
Show intel.
"
752,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Sure.
I mean with the service team multiple times a week and get daily updates on the reliability vehicle, we -- the best service of course is no service, like that's -- like vehicle just reliability and quality being so good that services rarely required, that's the main like eliminate the need for service.
And in terms of increasing, so as resources initially we're opening service centers as fast as we can and have already opened to 25 new service locations quarter and that will increase the rate of service center opening will increase dramatically into the course of this year, as well as more mobile service.
Most of this is really great because it's like we just come to you and fix the car, wherever you are and it's hard to beat that for convenience.
The cost delivery we've made master improvements to logistics for getting parts to service centers.
Hey, Jerome, do you want to -- Jerome is how we manage the service, global service and...
"
753,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yeah.
We had the original service heads the US at the factory last week, and it was incredibly helpful, just a closed loop on -- for what service and production and with the software team.
And for example, like a lot of services visits are just a questions about how to use the car and...
"
754,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Like if I had, I turn it on.
"
755,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Like it's good.
It's like, how do I turn it on? Okay.
So just providing better feedback on user interface and officially how you turn it on.
And yeah.
A whole bunch of things that are quite elementary to reduce service load.
"
756,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Drew?
"
757,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,12,"If we hadn't had lunch in 2003, Tesla wouldn't [Indecipherable] basically.
"
758,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,13,"So about 28-ish.
"
759,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Cell volume is approximately matching the production of ramp rate.
"
760,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Nothing major.
It's just a distribution warehouse.
"
761,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,16,"I -- yeah, don't get worked up too much about detailed price plans, but are you asking like what do I think the long-term demand for Model 3 is in Greater China region? I think it's about from Shanghai Gigafactory, I think it's actually a long-term demand is about 5,000 a week.
"
762,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,17,"No.
Our plan is to -- well, to source cars to greater Europe area from Fremont, California and until we have European Gigafactory operational.
And that's -- but that's probably a couple of years before, it's probably 2021 before we have an operational Gigafactory in Europe.
And so at that time, we will source from California, yeah.
It's like this speculation, it's my opinion, but so what I think, say, long-term demand is for Model 3, it's probably 15,000 units a week globally, something like that.
"
763,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Yeah.
I think we'll -- demand in Q3 will exceed Q2.
It has thus far and I think we'll see some acceleration of that.
So -- and then I think Q4 will be, I think very strong.
So we expect that quarter-over-quarter improvements.
I think Q1 next year will be tough.
I think Q3 or 4 will be good, Q1 will be tough.
Q2 will be not as bad, but still tough.
And then I see like Q3 and Q4 next year will be incredible.
"
764,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,19,"Actually, we're just talking about this earlier today.
We're not quite sure ourselves.
I think there's some cannibalization.
Maybe the pulse expectation in the market that there's like some big overhaul coming for S and X, which then cause people to hesitate to buy if they think there's some like radical redesign coming, which is why I've stated publicly that this is not the case.
The Model S and X today are radically better than the ones that when we first started production, especially S.
Like -- say like 2012 or 2013 Model S compared to today's Model S, night and day.
In fact, I still run into people I know who have like 2013 Model S and they think it hasn't changed.
And like, it is dramatically better in every way.
But we don't do model years.
We just roll in improvements as they come.
So -- but I think there is maybe a communications issue where people don't realize just how much better the S and X are today than when we first started.
And we actually want to address that communication issue and just get a better understanding from the front lines, like what demand should be higher for S and X than it is and will get to the bottom of it and fix it.
"
765,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Well, if you factor in the full self-driving option, I think it is in, in fact, the year.
We seem to get the future's done, make sure they are great, rolling out and recognize revenue and increase the take rate on full self-driving.
There's also -- for the existing fleet, there's a very significant opportunity to upgrade the existing fleet to full self-driving.
So most of the fleet has not purchased this option yet.
So there's a significant margin potential for the existing fleet to upgrade to full self-driving, which most of the fleet can.
So yes, absolutely, I think that like long term, we are talking 25%, 30%.
Not long term meaning, like a year.
Long term like in terms of vernacular, that 30% gross margin is I think quite likely.
"
766,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Yes, I just want to like to see what the labor hours were quarter-on-quarter.
"
767,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,22,"Great.
Yeah.
So like, for a core financial health standpoint, I think I'd just like to echo Jerome's words.
I think Tesla's fiscal discipline is dramatically better than times in the past.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha of JMP Securities.
Your line is open.
"
768,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Yeah.
Lunch was [Indecipherable], that's the reasons I'd like this.
"
769,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Well, we are reconfiguring the floorspace at Fremont and there's quite a lot of factory space that's probably taken up with the S/X parts warehousing, parts for the S/X line and we don't really need that so that's where we're putting a lot of the Model Y activity.
Jerome, do you want to add?
"
770,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Yeah (multilple speakers) I'm sorry, go ahead.
"
771,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,26,"Yes.
"
772,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,27,"I mean, I feel confident, it's -- let's just say that the trend is very clearly toward being able to get to 10,000 vehicles a week, of which that would be -- there is rough numbers like 8,300 to 8,600 Model 3s and the balance in S and X.
So there's sort of 1,600 to 1,800 S/X.
In round numbers, 8,500 3s, 1,500 S/X per week, but probably a bit more than that.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Dan Levy from Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
"
773,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,28,"The regulatory credits is like, I mean it's a relatively small part of the equation for Tesla.
So -- I think the ZEV credit situation I think when is reformed because the market for ZEV credits is negligible.
Now some of what's happening here is other manufacturers are kind of waiting to see how their EV sales due before buying any credits from Tesla and so it kind of depends on how that goes if they sell more EVs then there's not really need to do with Tesla and if they sell few, [Indecipherable].
"
774,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,29,"I mean, I don't know if we want to talk about the details of battery supply.
We've got a good handle on.
We don't expect to be self constrained in China for the next year, I don't know.
Drew, what do you think?
"
775,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,30,"Yeah, I mean, I think you probably need to like just do like a reset like mostly a Master Plan for our Powerplant 3, but it's really like just under Battery Day will be kind of national, which is like, OK, how do we get from kind of [Indecipherable] gigawatt hours per year to multiple terawatt hours per year.
What -- that's a pretty dry and scale increase -- so yes.
Sort of roughly 100 like a 28 gigawatt hours right now, well, actually there is one where you count the factories in Japan.
So a little over 30% to 35% like that.
And how do we get like 2 terawatt hours a year? What would you like? So to order bank to increase.
"
776,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,31,"Yeah.
"
777,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,32,"In order to make fundamental shift in the world's energy usage and really transform things to sustainable energy future, if you're not in the terawatt hour ranges, it's like, it's a nice new story, but is not fundamentally changing the energy equation.
"
778,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,33,"Yeah, I think it's probably too much focus on S and X.
And the S and X are -- and they are nice, but they're not -- and it's like without them, we couldn't spell sexy.
So the main reason the reason -- well, it's not the main reason, but a reason, is we want to keep spelling sexy.
So that's not a reason, I should say not the main reason but to keep going with the S and X.
But the story for Tesla future is fundamentally Model 3 and Model Y and I think like my guess is like long-term sales of anything a couple of years, I think.
The demand for -- sales demand for 3 is like in the order of 0.75 million units a year, and it's probably 1.25 million per year for Model Y and combined like it's maybe 2 million from those two vehicles and then S/X is like may be 80,000 to 100,000 a year.
So it's like 4% or 5% of the volume in 3 and Y.
And then truck throw a truck in there, pickup truck and a semi, it just gets smaller and smaller.
So there -- there are great products, but there -- from a volume standpoint, they're not all that important in the long term.
"
779,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,34,"That you guys talked about in 2003 as well.
"
780,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,35,"Actually, I said, we've opened 25 service locations.
I think really what we find is that the word-of-mouth for Tesla is incredibly good.
So once there's a new piece of customers in a particular area, they love the cars and they talk to all their friends about it, and that's really what drives sale.
So if you think of like retail locations, kind of like a viral seed in an area.
It would grow organically by itself, but the retail locations actually is like a viral seed.
It's not they aren't needed, they just like an accelerant.
What is needed for sales in any given area, I'd say this worldwide, frequent retail like this country is different or that country is different.
Like people around the world pretty much want the same thing, so in my experience.
They have to have a service location that's convenient so it can be like you've got to drive eight to five hours to a service location.
You've got to have service, you have to have the supercharging and charging all sorted out, consumer financing and then the price must makes sense.
And any place where those four things are true, our sales are great.
So we're rolling out service centers like crazy.
Service centers are the key to sales, not the retail location.
"
781,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,36,"Yeah, supercharging is incredibly important.
You can't just have like 80% of the routes that somebody wants to take.
You have to have 100% routes, because a car is like really freedom to travel, anything [Indecipherable] travel is -- it drives the fundamental value of the product.
"
782,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,37,"Yes, exactly real or perceived for freedom travel.
"
783,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,38,"Yeah, we expect to be able to offer full self-driving actually everywhere, except EU because there's just some committee rules that were put in place years ago that needs to be changed.
It's up -- from a technical standpoint, it's very doable, but we just need to work through the regulatory committees to get the regulatory approvals and rules changed.
It's just -- it all just takes a bit longer than other places.
But I think we'll see a lot of pressure from our customers in Europe to have these rules changed so they can have access to full self-driving.
And I think at the end of the day, the regulators will answer to the public.
So I think it's just a temporary thing and it's as quite specific to the -- to EU rules, and we're just not present really when those rules were drafted.
So that's we got to put in place.
But they're making a ton of sense, but we just got to work through the process to change them.
"
784,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,39,"It's actually just taking the parts that were stored in a bunch of warehouses and just moving them to the service centers.
And the thing that makes sense is I think to have the service centers where the parts are kind of all on the wall, it's like a supermarket.
Like you always know where the parts are and you just go meet there and going to grab it and just replenish the shelves with parts.
And so what we're basically putting parts that are used more frequently than like six weeks on the walls on service centers, there's no ordering of the parts, you just go take it from the shelves and put it on the car.
Really want to get to not merely same-day service, but same hour.
Sort of like applied generally to service.
"
785,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,40,"Yeah.
"
786,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,41,"Yeah.
And also just having parts, if I may -- if we make them internally or if they made by a supplier sending them directly to the service center instead of like having them go through a bunch of distribution outlets, in fact, the warehouse in China from the last trip actually the China team here, is there anything we're doing that we should fix this.
And yeah, we'll -- several of the parts that require replacement are literally made in China, and then we end up shipping them to New Jersey and then back to China.
And could we please just ship them like literally across the road.
And like, yes, no problem.
There's always like crazy things that happen as -- if you're like -- if you have a 45,000 person company and then just basically start stop doing silly things.
It's -- yeah, a lot of what is needed for improvement.
"
787,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,42,"Yeah.
"
788,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,43,"Yes, I mean Tesla is the only company made some things that volume that is fully vertically integrated all the way through sales and service and charging everything.
So we really just need to look at total system efficiency and say in the limit if Tesla was the auto industry.
How would we do it to maximize economic efficiency? And that's -- and then we got to like recalculate that optimization as we achieve greater scale.
We're confident we can achieve a fundamentally better economic efficiency than the rest of the auto industry.

789,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,44,
790,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,45,"Well, 2003 is good year.
"
791,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,46,"Sounds good.
Well, JB, thanks for role and creating this company and growing well.
So that's the way you guys talking about in 2003, sounds like the right year.
"
792,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,47,"Good year.
"
793,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,48,"Yeah, with the -- looks like finally ready, it's ready to put in your car, AC propulsion [Indecipherable].
If you could give us regular credit.
"
794,TSLA,2019,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,49,"Yeah.
It's great.
Some of the questions there.
Questions and Answers:
"
795,TSLA,2019,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Thanks.
So Elon, you mentioned the importance of full self-driving for gross margin.
You've also mentioned the importance of China.
Do you expect to be able to offer the full self-driving suite that you offer in the US and China? And I guess even in Europe where they've also been a little bit tougher on regulating?
"
796,TSLA,2019,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"Okay.
And the second question is, you mentioned service a number of times.
There's always been some, I think, growing frustration with owners.
And you mentioned parts availability and you've issued the dealership model, but I guess how do you plan on increasing parts availability without the corresponding working capital commitment that would be required as the fleet continues to grow?

"
798,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah, sure.
Thanks, Elon.
A few things I want to highlight before moving into the Q&A.
Overall, Q2 was a strong quarter for Tesla.
I'm extremely proud of the team for the progress we've made.
We've achieved record vehicle production and delivery, record storage production and deployment, record services and other revenue with a corresponding reduced lost.
As we've mentioned a few times, we stabilized international logistics and delivery operations and higher volumes, and we saw gross margin improvement in nearly every aspect of the business, adjusting for the impact of regulatory credit revenue.
As a result of these accomplishments, we once again achieved strong free cash flows, which is only partially attributed to working capital benefits, we also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion in that proceeds in May.
Thus we exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, the highest in our history.
Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1, aided by higher volumes and progress on cost efficiencies.
A few things to note, there is $117 million with an operating expenses for restructuring.
We had a sequential reduction of $104 million related to regulatory credits, which is inherently lumpy.
And in our other income line, we saw $66 million reduction.
This is nearly entirely due to foreign exchange, which we don't hedge.
GAAP automotive gross margin only reduced slightly despite the reduction in credit revenue and expected reductions in our vehicle average selling prices.
Adjusting for the impact of credits, automotive gross margin improved materially.
For Model S and Model X, ASPs were impacted by pricing actions, applied to inventory of vehicles built prior to the launch of our powertrain and suspension upgrades in April, the majority of which were sold and delivered in Q2.
For Model 3, global ASPs stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a sequential reduction, yet gross profit per Model 3 improved, representing the continued success of our cost management efforts.
Note that we continue to defer a significant portion of revenue associated with full self driving, which will be recognized in future periods.
Upon the release of additional features.
Operating expenses, net of restructuring continues to improve as well, despite the increases in volume, reflecting the amends focus on improving our operating efficiency.
And while operating expenses and capital expenses may appear to be a naturally low this quarter, that's not the case, rather these reflect continued progress on cost efficiency and ability to scale our core technologies and processes.
If you take a step back here, I think it's important to remember the Tesla is on a long-term journey and it's difficult to see the full picture, looking quarter-to-quarter.
We committed that Model 3 will be a transformative product, both for the industry and our business.
Three years ago, we unveiled the Model 3; two years ago, we brought the product to market; one year ago, we demonstrated our ability to build the Model 3 at high rate.
So far this year, we've demonstrated our ability to manage global deliveries and logistics at a higher rate, but the most important thing is that we've demonstrated our ability to generate significant organic demand, as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were non-reservation holders.
And thus far in Q3, our order pacing is ahead of where we were at this point in Q2.
And as we noted in our Q2 production and delivery release, our order backlog increased over the course of Q2.
Ultimately, the Model 3 is accomplishing what our business needs it to do, it expanded our sales and customer base, enabling us to generate cash, we need to reinvest.
In the process, we've appropriately managed our operating expenses and have reduced the cost of running the business.
This is critically important because I feel as though we've broken through a baseline six cost barrier, enabled by the success of the Model 3 business.
With continued focus on execution and cost management, the next 12 to 18 months should be the most exciting yet.
During this time, we believe that Gigafactory Shanghai will be producing at scale, Model Y will be in production, addressing the most popular vehicle segment, our European Gigafactory will be well under way.
Our autonomous driving feature suite will continue to develop, energy products business will grow and maybe a few other things along the way.
And while there is inherent risk in any large and ambitious set of projects, our intent is to grow and invest as fast as we can afford to.
With the cash we have on hand, and the stabilization of Model 3 across the key areas, as I've noted, we believe we're in great shape for this next phase of growth.
"
799,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yes, just to add on the tax credit step down, so the step down from Q2 to Q3 was significantly lower than the step down from Q4 to Q1.
It's also important to keep in mind that there's seasonality in the auto business in Q1, which also is part of the impact.
But generally speaking, our order rates so far this quarter is higher than where we were at this point in Q2, and we haven't seen a significant impact on US-based orders as a result of the step down.
"
800,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"And then we'll grow again and we'll need to rebuild those processes.
"
801,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,
802,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, and we continue to take significant costs out of the Model 3, in particular, as well, and Jerome can comment further on this.
But every week, nearly every week, we had record lows on the labor content to build the vehicle.
And we saw an ASP adjustment net reduction in Model 3 from Q1 to Q2, yet the gross profit on the vehicle expanded attributed to the cost reduction efforts are under way.
"
803,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah, on your question about the cadence of regulatory credits, it's -- it is, generally, as I've commented in the past, we expect regulatory credits to become a more meaningful part of our business.
On a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's very difficult to forecast them.
As you saw from Q1 to Q2, that declined.
And as you model regulatory credits in Q3, I would not expect a significant increase in regulatory credits, although it's hard to put that exactly.
The regulatory credits composition is a mixture of this particular deals that are 1 time.
There's also some that are production based over time.
The production based ones are easier to forecast because it's based on cars that we build and we get an outset to that way.
The deal specific ones are lumpier which makes it more difficult.
And then your final question was on, does it make sense to sacrifice pricing to drive regulatory credit in certain markets.
It might.
I'm not sure if we've specifically gone into the details of that, but generally, we're selling cars in markets at the prices we think are appropriate, and the regulatory credits is something traditional.
We generally try not to run the business based on regulatory credit revenue.
"
804,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"That's what you have to think about it.
"
805,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"That's what we need to do.
"
806,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yeah, and we're going city by city on the service center point.
We're looking at where our populations are of existing customers.
We're mapping driving time from the customers to the service centers inclusive of traffic to improve intensification of our service centers and locations in which are customers currently reside.
We do have various that are under representative for service centers where the drive turn is too long, where the population that don't have the appropriate access to changing the service centers and we're working as fast as we can to get places up and running in those areas.
So it's very systematically being mapped out with a focus on service and supercharging as opposed to retail presence.
"
807,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
And specifically on the working capital piece of this, we actually have a significant amount of service parts inventory.
The challenges it's not just at the service centers.
"
808,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"And so a lot of the lag that is experienced is we have to get the parts from the distribution center to the service center.
And so by moving -- by localizing the parts, I don't expect that to be a large working capital drain on the company.
It might actually be the reverse where we don't need to store as many parts eventually.
"
809,TSLA,2019,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"And as the scale of the business increases, the economics of localization of things like parts distribution make a lot more sense.
Whereas in the past, when the company was smaller, having centralized centers was easier from a cost perspective.
So the business -- because a company is growing so fast, as Elon has mentioned, we have to continue to redesign processes and systems to restabilize ourselves in a plateau of volume.
"
810,TSLA,2019,2,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,0,"Yeah, as you pointed out, the best service is no service.
So we're trying to continue improving the quality of the cars.
And track this daily and fewer and fewer service visits are required from the most recent cars that we're building.
So we're on a good trend there.
We also need our luck pure work to finish the cars manufacturing.
Besides that, we still more parts of all the service centers and we ship everything same day pretty much, so that people don't have to wait for cars -- for parts, and we accelerate service and we increase capacity.
There's a lot of improvements that we've already implemented and many more on the way.
So I'm relatively optimistic and I'm happy to help with the service team.
"
811,TSLA,2019,2,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,1,"And it's the number one visit is how to use Autopilot test.
So yeah, a bit of education there helps.
"
812,TSLA,2019,2,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,2,"Yeah.
"
813,TSLA,2019,2,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,3,"Yeah, we're optimizing the real estate trying to conciliate everything under one roof, reduce the cost, nothing special there.
"
814,TSLA,2019,2,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,4,"Our labor costs are more than 50% reduction in one-year.
Yeah, it's progressing every quarter.
"
815,TSLA,2019,2,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,5,"And reduced in half, yes, since the Q3 last year, but it's also all -- for the fact that [Indecipherable] spares, this craft is reduced to pretty much nothing reduced 90% year-over-year, spares are just more than half.
So we're -- our goal is to make the comp more affordable and sort of pushing every day, yeah.
And every week, we'll hit records on most lines.
And in terms of output and cost per unit, yeah.
We're in very good dynamic and level of difficulty discipline that I have not -- we have not had in the past.
"
816,TSLA,2019,2,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,6,"Yeah, we're improving the material delivery for S and X just like we have done for Model 3 using some radical improvements.
We reduced production part warehousing costs by again 90%, 9-0, since Q3 last year, and so we're making a lot of room.
We have -- we are much more efficient with parts delivery and helps that going in production actually.
And so that space that we've cleared out, I'm looking at it right now in Fremont which is going to put Model Y stuff in there.
So if you visit the factory from, I would say every six months, you'd have a hard time recognizing and finding your way.
It's constantly changing and evolving.

818,TSLA,2021,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
I was hoping maybe just, first, you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the rollout of version 9 of FSD and the transition to the subscription model.
It sounds like some of this is about to roll out next month.
I'm not sure if that's the subscription model, but maybe you could just spend a little time talking about how impactful you expect that to be.
"
819,TSLA,2021,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"OK.
Great.
And I was hoping, Zach, maybe you can just talk a little bit about opex.
There was a noticeable increase, even excluding SBC.
Obviously, a lot going on this quarter, but can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about that going forward?

And welcome to Tesla's first-quarter 2021 q&a webcast.
I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
Our Q1 results were announced at about 1 p.m.
pacific time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.
Please press star one now if you would like to join the question to you.
But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
Elon? 
"
822,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,1,"Thank you very much.
We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
"
823,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,2,"Thank you.
Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
From Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
Your line is open.
"
824,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,3,"Thank you.
Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you.
From Dan Levy from Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
"
825,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,4,"All right.
Thank you very much.
Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for today.
Thank you very much for dialing in and for listening, and we'll speak to you again in about three months.
Thank you.
"
826,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,5,
827,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,6,"Thank you very much.
And we'll first take retail questions from, say, website.
The first question is, how is Dojo coming along? Could Dojo unlock an AWS like business line for Tesla over the next few years?
"
828,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,7,"Thank you very much.
Let's go to the second question from retail investors.
The recent price changes on solar roof have been discouraging for customers and investors.
Could just like share more about solar roof challenges? And if the outlook has changed at all, i.e., 1,000 roofs per week?
"
829,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,8,"Thank you very much.
And the next retail question is, master of coin, can you tell us anything about Tesla's future plans in digital currency space or when any such major developments might be revealed?
"
830,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,9,"Thank you.
And the fourth question from retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle mainstream media's imminent, massive and deceptive click-based headline campaigns on safety of autopilot or FSD for a specialty PR job of some sort?
Unknown speaker
Well, I can -- I'll take this one, guys.
From the safety side, I continue to say -- Elon, drive the point and I'll -- go ahead, Elon.
"
831,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,10,"OK.
Thank you very much.
Let's go to the next question from institutional investors.
The first question is, proponents of alternative grid storage technologies claim that lithium-ion is unsuited for long-term storage at scale due to vampire drain.
Could 4680 cells address this limitation? Is the limitation even relevant for charging the energy equation?
Unknown speaker
Yes.
Just let me jump in on the vampire drain.
That's definitely not the issue.
Good lithium ion cell self discharges less than 0.001% of its energy per day.
So it's -- this vampire drain is maybe not that...
"
832,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,11,"Thank you very much.
Let's go to the next question from institutional investors, which is you suggested that between a 5x to 10x improvement is achievable in the automotive production versus the first Model 3 line on the first principles physics analysis.
Where does Berlin sit relative to that limit?
"
833,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,12,"Thank you.
And last question from an institutional investor is master plan part two talks about an urban transport vehicle that is smaller than traditional bus with greater aerial density achieved by removing the central aisle.
Do you have any updates to share on this goal?
"
834,TSLA,2021,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,13,"OK.
Thank you very much.
So let's move to analyst Q&A.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you.
First question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
Your line is open.
"
835,TSLA,2021,1,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Hi.
good evening.
Thanks.
Two questions.
One is on COGS.
I think we've gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction related to powertrain.
But I'd like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS, ex powertrain, as you'd still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make the math work on a $25,000 vehicle.
So what levers do you have to reducing your cost, ex powertrain? Is it just more scale, better supplier pricing or is it just based on ongoing cost reduction?
"
836,TSLA,2021,1,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"Great.
And then just related.
As you see Berlin and Austin ramp, I'd like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont versus the new capacity.
Obviously, Fremont non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.
You had to retrofit that to your need.
So maybe you can give us a sense of how your new capacity is going to differ versus Fremont, what are the areas that you have efficiencies that you previously didn't have and maybe how much does that add up to improved COGS over time to help you achieve that $25,000 vehicle.

838,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,0,"Great.
Thank you.
So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.
Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
And we've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we've ever seen.
So this is -- if you talk about we're used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in in Q1.
So Model 3 became the best-selling midsized premier sedan in the world, in fact, I should say the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time the best-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3.
And this is only three and a half years into production and was just two factories.
For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion engine competitors, I think, is quite remarkable.
In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly a quarter million Model 3s, which translates to annualized rate of half a million per year.
When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year.
So I'm not 100% certain next year, but I think it's quite likely.
I'd say more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
Then with regard to full self driving.
Full self driving beta continues to make great progress.
It is definitely one of the -- I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that's maybe ever existed.
And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, specifically real-world artificial intelligence.
And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that's using on the order of 70 or 80 watts.
So this is a much harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that.
This has got to fit into a smaller sprain.
And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we're finally getting rid of one of the last crutches.
Radar was really -- it was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good.
You actually just need vision to work.
And when your vision works, it works better than the best human because it's like having eight cameras, it's like having eyes in the back of your head, beside your head and has three eyes of different focal distances looking forward.
This is -- and processing it at a speed that is superhuman.
There's no question in my mind that with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average person.
So -- but it is a hard problem because we are actually solving something quite fundamental about artificial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI.
And we are.
So -- and key to solving this is also having some massive data set.
So just having well over 1 million cars on the road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations -- sort of like so many weird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with -- one example is like a car as an actual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling from the front of the kayak in front of the car and -- but yet the car must ignore this and just look at the road.
So it's really quite tricky, but I am highly confident that we will get this done.
So -- yes.
This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3.
So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts.
Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.
This is a huge problem.
But then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China because we're unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions.
So -- which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada.
So that was a very challenging situation.
I think we're mostly out of that particular problem.
That's just -- those was just two of many challenges.
So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages.
So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Model S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has, for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system.
There's just a lot of issues encountered, ensuring that the new factory was as we're saying this was by far [Inaudible] smaller piece.
So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe.
And we're trying to get all the -- in the cars slowly for the past few months.
But we're just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we built.
But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.
And then to be in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 as well.
So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high.
So it's really just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes.
So probably, like, we're going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week.
Perhaps if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500.
This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which is just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
But I do think this will get solved.
So it's just a matter of time and then we'll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
It's a great car.
It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product.
So in conclusion is there's a lot to be excited about in 2021 and '22.
We're building factories as quickly as we can.
Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai.
In the background, we're continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster and other products.
Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success.
Now on to questions.
"
839,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,1,"OK.
"
840,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,2,"Well, so we have the -- and Drew can add to this.
But we have the -- a small sort of pilot plant, which is still big by normal standards, expected to have like a 10-gigawatt hour per year capability in Fremont, California.
And we made quite a few cells.
We're not quite yet at the point where we think the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we're getting close to that point.
And then we've already ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and then much of it for Austin as well.
So we really don't flick the nitty-gritty elements.
But overall, I think we still feel quite optimistic about this achieving volume production of the 4680 next year.
What do you think?
Unknown speaker
Yes, thanks.
Just one thing I would add is there's been a lot of questions about yields.
Actually, I noticed people asking about that.
The yield progress has been really strong every day, and we were really still in commissioning phase.
We were really still in commissioning phase with most of the tools to the point where we're confident that the yield trajectory aligns with our internal cost projections.
We did talk about yield also at Battery Day, which is one of the reasons why it's useful to check in on that.
It takes a while, as Elon just mentioned, to go from prototype to production.
And it's not just parts.
It's processes, it's equipment.
But as we've matured the process equipment, we've gotten to where we need to be on the yield side.
"
841,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,3,"Yeah.
And basically, this is just a guess because we don't know for sure, but it appears as though we're about 12 -- probably not more than 18 months away from volume production of the 4680.
Now at the same time, we are actually trying to have our cell supply of partners ramp up their supply as much as possible.
So this is not something that is to the exclusion of suppliers.
It is in conjunction with suppliers.
So we want to be super clear about that.
This is not about replacing suppliers.
It is about supplementing the suppliers.
So -- and we have a very strong partnership with CATL, with Panasonic and LG.
And we would -- our request to our strategic partners for cell supply is please make us -- please supply us with as much as you possibly can.
Provided the price is affordable, we will buy everything that they can make.
Unknown speaker
Yeah.
Yeah.
And specific to that, we're on track to more than double the supplier capacity over the next l3.
"
842,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,4,"Yeah, exactly.
We do expect from suppliers willing to receive double the cell output next year versus this year.
"
843,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,5,"We're aiming for comparable margins in storage as in vehicle.
But it is important to bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than the storage.
So -- we're already are at margins with the Powerwall.
But some additional work is needed for the Megapack to achieve good margins.
Yes, Drew, what do you think?
Unknown speaker
Yes.
Sorry, just jumping in, Elon.
Absolutely agree.
Powerwall is mature.
We've been producing Powerwall 2 for three years now and we're at good margins there.
But Megapack has more room to go to achieve our targets.
"
844,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,6,"We have a clear runway for improving the cost per the megawatt hour of the Megapack.
Unknown speaker
Absolutely.
Yes, we do.
"
845,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,7,"So go ahead, guys.
"
846,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,8,"I mean, I think all of the above.
Unknown speaker
Yes, I mean on the vehicle side, there's plenty of opportunity as well.
Obviously, building a car like a Model S lot is quite complex and has various moving parts.
Model 3 and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.
But when you look at some of the other advancements that we're including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and Berlin, we've reduced the body count by as much as 60%, and the park cost money.
So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get the economies of scale when we start to talk about the volumes we're considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well, and powertrain continues to be integrated into that.
"
847,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,9,"Yes.
I think we don't want to talk too much about future product development.
The earnings call is not the right place for -- to make major product announcement.
So yes.
We'll get there, but we'll talk about it later.
"
848,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,10,"Thanks everyone.

849,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,11,
850,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,12,"Sorry Zach.
My apologies.
I was on mute.
"
851,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,13,"So yes, I was just basically saying that the -- although like right now, people think of Tesla as -- a lot will think of Tesla as a car company or as an energy company.
I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company.
I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world.
Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self driving that others cannot.
So if you look at the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of self driving.
So we couldn't find a powerful enough neural net that runs a computer.
So we designed and built our own.
The software out there was really quite primitive for this task.
And so we built the team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world.
And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a neural net computer, our brain.
Our brain is neural net computer.
And it's -- the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it's designed for eyes in the brain.
And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can see in all directions at once, you can see three focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired.
It's never sort of texting.
It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human.
Then it seems pretty obvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of the average person.
So that's what we're doing.
Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that.
So because we're -- we have over 1 million cars, and perhaps next year, we'll have 2 million cars in active use, providing vast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful training system.
And currently, we use Tesla training software.
So we developed a lot of training software, a lot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky.
This means all eight cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time.
There wasn't any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool.
Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling.
So now we're getting quite good at auto labeling, where we do -- where -- that the trainers train the training system and then the system auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to confirm that it is correct and perhaps make edits.
And then every time an edit is made, that further trains the system.
So it's kind of like a flywheel that's just sort of spinning up.
And really, the only way to do this is with vast amounts of video data.
So then we need to train this efficiently.
So Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized for neural net training.
We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efficient on, say -- not sure what the exact right metric is, but say, per frame of video, we think it will be an order of magnitude more cost efficient in hardware and in energy usage for a frame of video compared to a GPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we're aware of.
So then possibly that could be used by others.
It does seem as though over time -- I mean just an observation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing is and more and more of the compute stack.
We -- conventional computing -- well, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but it will become -- but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute.
So a long story but I think, yeah probably others will want to use it too and we will make it available.
"
852,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,14,"Yeah.
First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong.
So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs.
So production is going fine, but we are chocked at the inflation point.
We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically.
Some roofs are to be literally two or three times easier than other roofs.
So you just can't have a one-size-fits-all situation.
If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the roof sort of -- the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solar roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes 3x what we -- what our initial quotes were.
So in those cases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit and -- but what we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money.
We just got to provide a refund of the early deposit.
But that's what is, I think, most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we're shifting the whole sort of solar situation -- the solar power -- well, basically, solar power situation to there's only one product basically -- or there's only one configuration.
Every house -- we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall.
That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof.
But in all cases, it will have the power to -- technically, this is -- it's actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will.
The plus refers to a higher peak power capability.
So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the specification on the website.
They have about twice the power capability roughly.
It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguably twice the steady-state power of the specification of the website.
The energy is the same, but the power is roughly double.
And all the installations -- so all installations will have a Powerwall.
And the difficulty installation will dramatically -- or the difficulty of the installation will be much less.
It will be much easier because the power from the solar roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels will only ever go directly into the Powerwall.
And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility means -- between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house.
You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.
Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel.
So this is extremely important for scalability is.
It's the only way to do it, really.
And this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility.
And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power.
So that gives people energy security.
And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid.
So let's say that there's a -- like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the power demand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power.
There's no power storage.
No good point on power storage.
However, with a whole bunch of Powerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power.
And so if the grid needs more power, we can actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand.
So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility.
This is profound.
I'm not sure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessary because we are headed toward a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where people are moving toward electric vehicles.
This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes and businesses will increase significantly.
We will -- there will need to be a bunch more electricity coming somewhere.
In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as much electricity as we currently have.
So these are rough numbers, but roughly you need twice -- roughly need twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need three times much electricity if all heating goes electric.
So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for the utilities.
Because -- and in fact, I think this will be very -- if this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers.
They won't be able to do it.
They won't be able to react fast enough.
And we're going to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeing brownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there's a massive change going on with the transition to electric transport.
And we're seeing more extreme weather events.
This is a recipe for disaster.
So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level, at the house.
In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind, which are the main forms of renewable electricity, can be -- that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn't blow, sometimes it blows wide.
Sometimes it blows too much and sometimes it didn't blow enough.
But if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed.
The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy.
And so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future.
And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level.
If it doesn't occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants.
So they have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place.
They'll have to increase the size of the substations, is a nightmare.
This must occur.
There must be solar plus battery.
That's the only way.
So yeah.
"
853,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,15,"No.
I think -- no, please go ahead.
I think it's just worth going through the facts of the -- what -- I mean, specifically, there were -- there was an article regarding a tragedy where there was a high-speed in Tesla.
But -- and there was really just extremely deceptive media practices where it was claimed to be autopilot where this is completely false.
And those journalists should be ashamed of themselves.
Please go ahead, Lars.
Unknown speaker
Yeah.
Thanks, Elon.
So I was just saying, we're committed to safety in all our designs, and that's number one in what we do here.
Regarding the crash in Houston, specifically, we worked directly with the local authorities, NTSB and NHTSA, wherever applicable and whenever they reach out to us for help directly on the engineering level and whatever else we can support.
In that vein, we did a study with them over the past week to understand what happened in that particular crash.
And what we've learned from that effort was that Autosteer did not and could not engage on the road condition that -- as it was designed.
Our adaptive cruise control only engage when a driver was buckled in about 5 miles per hour.
And it only accelerated to 30 miles per hour with the distance before the car crashed.
As well adaptive cruise control disengage the cars fully to complete to a stop when the driver's seatbelt was unbuckled.
Through further investigation of the vehicle and accident remains, we inspected the car with NTSB and NHTSA and the local police and were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed so there must -- leading to a likelihood that someone was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash and all seatbelts post crash were found to be unbuckled.
We're unable to recover the data from the SD card at the time of impact, but the local authorities are working on doing that, and we await their report.
As I said, we continue to hold safety in a high regard and look to improve our products in the future through this kind of data and other information from the field.
"
854,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,16,"I just love they call it vampires.
Unknown speaker
Yeah.
I think the challenge with seasonal storage is your value proposition drops from hundreds of useful full cycles per year to less than maybe 10 or maybe even less than five cycles per year.
So it's just a different type of technology altogether that would make sense, given that it's more than an order of magnitude, different use case.
"
855,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,17,"Yeah.
We've got a long way to go before we're dealing with seasonal technology issues.
But certainly a way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar erring on the side of subway latitude and -- but then across a variety of longitude.
So essentially, like let's say, in the U.S., for example, if there was a -- I'm not sure if you'll understand this, you can actually power the entire United States with just sort of 100 -- roughly a 100-mile -- by a 100-mile grid of solar.
Some people don't quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States.
Almost nothing of this [Inaudible] of almost any country in the world.
The solar incident is a gigawatt per square kilometer.
This is insane.
In fact, you took the clear area, just the area or saying for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because of a nuclear power plant is there, in most cases, if you just put solar there, it would generate more power than the nuclear power plant because they typically have pretty wide clear areas.
So it really -- so if you have, say, 25% efficient solar panels and then those are 80% efficient in how they laid out, you're going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer.
Therefore, five straight kilometers is a gigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant.
It's really not much area at all.
And a lot of places can have wind and solar in place.
So anyway, it's entirely possible to power all of earth with a small percentage of earth's area.
And then to transfer that power through high-voltage DC lines with no new technology.
No -- you don't need like room temperature superconductors.
This another room temperature superconductors.
This is a total -- also another myth.
Room temperature superconductors, almost irrelevant, in my opinion, almost irrelevant.
Low-cost, long-distance power lines using copper or aluminum is very important.
So heating is important.
So that's current square type of resistance.
So as you increase voltage, you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is of minor relevance, like maybe you lose 5% to 7% with a high-voltage DC power line, something like that.
So I want to be clear.
No new materials is neceassary.
No new materials is necessary.
We just need to scale this thing up.
We -- the technologies exist today to solve renewable energy.
And some people will say, well, why don't we do it? That's because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanely gigantic.
So you can't just go and do 1 zillion terawatts overnight.
You've got to build the production capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for the solar cells.
You've got to put that into vehicles.
You've got to put that into station storage packs.
You've got to put that into solar panels and Solarglass Roofs, and you've got to deploy all this thing -- all this stuff.
But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this.
And we should try to accelerate it.
And the right thing to do, I think, from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist to agree is to have a common tax, just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to be bad than good, and we tend to tax fruit and vegetables less.
It was the same should be true.
We should tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy we think is probably good, just like cigarettes and alcohol versus fruits and vegetables.
This is common sense.
And -- but I guess on the plus side, I'm not suggesting anyone be complacent.
But sustainable energy, renewable energy will be sold, it is being sold, but it matters how fast we sold it.
And if we sold it faster, that's better for the world.
There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero.
I want to be clear, zero.
I think the bias will tend to be toward iron-based lithium-ion cells.
When we say lithium-ion, you will think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells.
It's more like 1% to 2% of the cell is lithium.
But the main part of the cell is the cathode, the main mass and cost in the cells is the cathode.
For high-energy cells, like for example, what we use in most -- most Teslas have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells.
However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it's just staying on the ground.
And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode technically.
But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary, so is the iron ore nickel.
I'm destroying the terminology.
Just think of it as iron and nickel.
And there's an insane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could possible use.
And there's also more lithium than we could possibly use.
Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron plus base lithium-ion cells.
"
856,TSLA,2021,1,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,18,"I think we're still quite far away from it.
I mean the thing to bear in mind with production is -- for those who've never done production, they just don't understand how insanely hard production is.
I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
Prototypes are trivial, they're child's play.
Production is hard, is very hard.
Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low cost, insanely difficult.
But Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car.
The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.
So this is -- this -- basically, myself and many others at Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done.
It was so hard to have no idea.
So anyway -- and the thing about making a large complex manufacturing object is, let's say you have first-order approximation, 10,000 unique items.
And even one of those items is slow, that says you wait, just one.
Doesn't matter how -- so trivial.
We've had production stop because of carpet in the trunk.
We've had production stop because of a USB cable.
At one point, for Model S, the -- we literally raided every electronics store in the Bay Area.
For a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable in the Bay Area because we went and bought them all to put them in the car, literally.
And there's like hundreds of stories like that.
So anyway, that -- solving that -- those constraints and a logistics problem that makes World War II look trivial.
I'm not kidding.
Like the scale is insane.
We're talking millions of cars, massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatory regimes.
It's insane.
So yeah.

"
858,TSLA,2021,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hi, guys.
Thanks so much for takng my question.
I'd love to get actually based on what you presented on the Battery Day.
In the last six, seven months, I want -- I was wondering how much progress you've made on that front, first, in terms of process development.
So how are things coming together on your pilot line? Are you getting to the kind of production throughput you were aiming for? And second and actually on your production ramp.
So I was wondering in which sites you're ramping production capacity for the 4680 cell and where you stand on ramping up that capacity as well.
And I have a quick follow-up on energy as well if that's possible.
"
859,TSLA,2021,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"OK.
And I had a quick follow-up on maybe, Zach, for you on your energy business.
So I understand like the negative gross margin with solar roof ran.
But I was wondering what do gross margin look like there when you look at the storage business and where you -- what's your ambition in terms of gross margin in that business as, I guess, it's going to grow in the mix in coming years.
So it's important for long-term modeling.

860,TSLA,2021,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,
861,TSLA,2021,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yes.
Thanks, Martin.
Thanks, Elon.
So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by three key items.
First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries.
The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation.
For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that's before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition.
And as he mentioned -- as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities, while the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult, and it's an evolving situation.
If we double-click within net income.
Auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentially and year over year.
This is in spite of the cost mentions for S and X and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we're experiencing start to be resolved.
On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending toward profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overhead.
On energy gross margins, these remained negative for second quarter.
This is driven by solar-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business.
We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall.
We're working as fast as we can to increase production.
And this will aid in profitability of this business as those volumes increase.
On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technology and growth.
In particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells, investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments.
On the SG&A side, we're setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to come there.
And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
Double-clicking on cash flows.
We continue to generate positive free cash flows, and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from S and X.
Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt.
We also invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 financials.
Taking a step back, we've generated $8 billion in operating cash flows and $4 billion in free cash flows over the past four quarters.
As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter.
Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels.
And so we're driving as fast as we can to increase our production rates.
As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we've discussed, continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs.
And we expect profitability and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements.
And then as we get toward the end of the year, our story will pivot toward the launch and ramp of our newest factories in Austin and Berlin.
So there's certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to.
Thank you, and we'll open it up for questions.
"
862,TSLA,2021,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
I'll jump in here.
So with respect to Dojo...
"
863,TSLA,2021,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Go ahead Elon.
"
864,TSLA,2021,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Sure.
Thanks, Martin.
So as I noted in our opening remarks and we've announced previously, so Tesla did invest $1.5 billion into bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that.
We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using bitcoin.
And so where our bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here.
Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn't being immediately used, trying to get some level of return on this, but also preserve liquidity.
Particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austin and Berlin and uncertainty that's happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able to access our cash very quickly is super important to us right now.
And there aren't many traditional opportunities to do this or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get good feedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity.
And bitcoin seemed at the time and so far has proven to be a good decision.
A good place to place some of our cash that's not immediately being used for daily operations or maybe not needed till the end of the year and be able to get some return on that.
And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currency space is that there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic here.
We're certainly watching it very closely at Tesla, watching how the market develops, listening to what our customers are saying.
But thinking about it from a corporate treasury perspective, we've been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the bitcoin market.
So our ability to build our first position happened quickly.
When we did the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly.
And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able to get cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us.
So we do believe long term in the value of bitcoin.
So it is our intent to hold what we have long term and continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles.
Specifically with respect to things we may do, there are things that we're constantly discussing.
We're not planning to make any announcements here, and we're watching this space closely.
So when we're ready to make an announcement on this front, if there's one to come, we'll certainly let you all know.
"
865,TSLA,2021,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yes.
We're seeing a lot of...
"
866,TSLA,2021,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
We're working on getting FSD subscription out.
There's a couple of internal technical dependencies, but from a business model perspective, that's aligned, and we're hoping to roll that out soon.
The key thing that I say here, there's a lot of potential for recurring revenue based on FSD subscription.
If you look at the size of our fleet and you look at the number of customers who did not purchase FSD upfront or on a lease and maybe want to experiment with FSD, this is a great option for them.
One of the things we'll need to keep an eye on is a potential transition from cash purchases of FSD subscription over to -- or cash purchases of FSD who may move over to FSD subscription.
And so there could be a period of time in which cash reduces in the near term and then as the portfolio of subscription customers builds up, then that becomes a pretty strong business for us over time.
But we're hoping to get this launched pretty soon and see what the response is to it.
"
867,TSLA,2021,1,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Sure.
On the R&D side, what we're seeing, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is kind of a convergence of a series of programs that are happening.
And our R&D opex spend kind of correlates to where we are in the product life cycle on different programs.
And so we're kind of at the tail end of investments in, what we call internally Palladium, which is the new Model S and Model X.
And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Elon had mentioned.
We're also getting very heavy into 4680 development that Drew and team are working on and the associated structural battery pack that goes along with that.
And so these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry.
And so we're investing heavily there on an R&D side to work out those kinks.
And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue to work through the development cycle of those.
And then I also mentioned Elon talked a bit about Dojo and the potential there.
So from neural net investments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make investments in.
On the SG&A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global.
And China is ramping quite quickly.
And we're trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume so that we have the right sales capacity, store capacity there, local investments and IT and others to manage the growth, such that as the growth comes, the execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we've seen in the past.
And so we're making investments there ahead of the growth.
And overall, as we looked at opex as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, we do expect to see a substantial drop from 2020 to 2021 as the volumes in the latter part of the year pick up.

882,TSLA,2021,4,toni-sacconaghi,ab-bernstein,True,0,"Yes, thank you, for taking my question.
I have two, please.
First, you spoke a lot about FSD and how the economics could be very attractive going forward.
I'm wondering if you could just share what your current attach rate might be for FSD on your vehicles, or how to think about the progress of your attach rate or revenue in FSD, let's say, in '21 versus '20? And how much deferred revenue for FSD was drawn down during the year? And I have a follow-up, please.
Thank you.
"
883,TSLA,2021,4,toni-sacconaghi,ab-bernstein,True,1,"OK.
Thank you for that.
Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask you.
You talked about your product roadmap and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better.
That would put you at 3.2 million vehicles or more in 2024.
And I think you made reference to Cybertruck, you know, maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024, or how do we think about that, or what else is missing in that equation?
"
884,TSLA,2021,4,toni-sacconaghi,ab-bernstein,True,2,
885,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,0,"Thanks, Martin.
So just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year, we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year.
This level of growth didn't happen by coincidence.
It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout the company.
Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reported quarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin.
Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of [Inaudible] small finger by now -- $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in 2021, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
This is a critical milestone for the company.
So after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
So we've begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
But that's not the most important thing.
We focus more on when to get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we've been making quite a few cars in Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
So in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we'll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new locations in the future.
Although we're not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will get through 2022 look at new locations, and probably be able to announce new locations toward the end of this year, I expect.
So -- in 2022, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
So the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
And, yeah, so that's -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
And last year was difficult to predict, and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but, you know, I'm not sure what you do for an encore to 2021, 2020.
Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in 2022 over 2021, you know, comfortably above 50% growth in 2022.
Full self-driving.
So, over time, we think full self-driving will become the most important source of profitability for Tesla.
It's -- actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty -- it's nutty good from a financial standpoint.
And I think we are completely confident at this point that it will be achieved.
And my personal guess is that we'll achieve full self-driving this year, yeah, with data safety level significantly greater than the present.
So it's -- you know, the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self-driving by a software update, I think, might end up being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history.
We shall see.
It would also have a profound impact on improving safety and on accelerating the world toward sustainable energy through vastly better asset utilization.
Let's see, so on the product road map front, there's quite a lot to talk about.
I'm not going to go through every sort of thing that we're working on because I think a lot of them deserve product launches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call.
So I'll talk kind of at a high level -- yeah, mostly at a high level.
The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.
So both last year and this year, if we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease.
This is a very important point that I think people do not -- a lot of people do not understand.
So last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues, rewriting code, changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central.
And there were not -- that was not the only supply chain issue, so -- just hundreds of things.
And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year.
So that's a good result.
But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
So if we'd actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
And the same is true of this year.
So we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
It would not make any sense because we'll still be parts constrained.
We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling, whatnot to create those vehicles: Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.
That is most likely.
But like I said, it is dependent on are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars? So in terms of priority of products, I think the -- I think actually the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
Capital equipment is distilled labor.
So what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage? I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point.
That's what Optimus is about, so very important.
Drew, do you want me to talk about the 4680 program?
"
886,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,1,"Or is this a good -- the right time?
"
887,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,2,"Yeah.
I think it really becomes quite a compelling solution to the consumer where you integrate the electric vehicles charging, solar, you know, energy storage, hot water, HVAC in a very tight, compact package.
That also looks good.
It just doesn't exist.
"
888,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,3,"That's Lars, by the way.
"
889,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,4,"Yeah, like system integration, too, like with phone --
"
890,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,5,"You're going out and everything, and the car can -- like the house can just heat and cool things because those are coming home, you know, type of thing. 
"
891,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,6,"It still needs to be like randomly that temperature when you're not there or, you know --
"
892,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,7,"Yeah, exactly.
So just do sensible things and just work really, I think it would be just quite a game-changer down the road.
We've got a lot of fish frying on it.
And so, it is a thing we will do but we're not committing to a time frame at this point.
"
893,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,8,"Yeah.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, would you consider splitting FSD packages into perpetual and term licenses with a higher tier for both options for commercial use? A perpetual license that could be attached to individual or business and not the vehicle itself.
"
894,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,9,"No, I mean, this sounds maybe too complicated.
We're just going to be focused on like what sells for the fully considered lowest cost per mile or kilometer of driving.
And these other -- so that's what matters like how do you maximize the efficiency of getting people from one place to another and then charge them in a sensible way, including the charging infrastructure.
That's a big part of it.
"
895,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,10,"So I'll be charging for money and charging for energy.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, is Dojo on track for summer 2022? And what challenges, if any, are you working through? Is Dojo necessary for FSD to operate better in cities like New York City? Or on a separate note, where should we expect the first implementation of Tesla Bots in your factories?
"
896,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,11,"OK.
There's a few questions on there, like six questions.
Yeah, Dojo appears to be on track for doing something useful in the summer this year.
The -- I think the threshold that really matters is at which point -- when does it become more competitive than a GPU cluster for training? And, obviously, the GPU cluster is getting better, so it's a moving target.
But that's the goal I've set for the team is the -- if the FSD team running our GPU supercluster needs to tell me that they want to use Dojo instead.
That's -- where -- that's the, you know, obvious sort of threshold.
And I don't know when that will -- I wouldn't say like success is 100% certain here.
I think, we just generally want to overestimate meeting options and underestimate ourselves.
But it does seem as though we might pass that threshold next year with Dojo if, you know, we execute well.
Dojo is not needed for full self-driving but it is a cost optimization on creating vast amounts of video data.
Cost optimization also, a rate of improvement.
You know -- so if you can train models faster, have a shorter iteration interval then you can make progress faster.
So not everything can be distributed to zoning GPUs.
There's some elements of serialization there.
So -- and then if Dojo is competitive, then, you know, it does seem like the kind of thing where we would offer it to other companies that want to do neural net training.
Those are very much a neural net training optimized system.
You know -- but in theory, it should be better than a generalized computing platform or say, GPUs, which were not really intended for, you know, the pixel shader.
It is not directly intended for optimizing training of neural networks.
They just happen to work better than CPUs in most cases.
So we should think like Dojos like a giant ASIC optimized for neural net training, especially video, or video-like things.
But as -- like I said, we're not saying for sure Dojo would succeed.
We think it will.
We would encourage those who think this is an interesting problem to join Tesla, and -- yeah.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the first use of Tesla Bots, whether it's in the factory or elsewhere?
"
897,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,12,"Yeah.
"
898,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,13,"Yeah.
The first use of the Tesla Bot, Optimus, the Optimus name seems to be sticking at least internally, Optimus Subprime.
Like if we can't find a use for it then we shouldn't expect that others would.
So the first use of the Optimus robots would be at Tesla, kind of like moving parts around the factory or something like that.
Martin Viecha
OK.
Thank you very much.
And the next question on insurance.
When do you plan on having your insurance service rolled out in all the states? International rollout timing? In markets that have Tesla insurance, what kind of uptake rates are you seeing?
"
899,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,14,"It should be clear, like we are pushing very hard for California to change the rules to allow informatics, which basically means that, you know, you're as safe as you're driving is measured.
So I think the current California rules are contrary to the best interest of the consumers in California, and should be changed.
"
900,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,15,"Yeah.
"
901,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,16,"Yeah.
And we get direct feedback on whether driving is safe.
And if they drive safe, their insurance cost is less, so they drive safer.
It encourages Tesla insurance with informatics, and real-time feedback encourages safer driving and rewards it monetarily.
It's great.
"
902,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,17,"Yeah.
"
903,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,18,"I don't think we want to comment on -- like that's -- it's always possible to increase the output of any given factory.
To say what's the next capacity, well, it's difficult to say what that next capacity is because you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity quite a lot.
You know, I think there's -- look at the big picture, you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
So even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
So, in the U.S., with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
The logistics costs are going to be much less.
But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
Yeah.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
"
904,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,19,"Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable? You know, there's -- you can make something infinitely desirable, but if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
That's the thing that will really set the rate.
Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of 40 million vehicles a year.
But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources? And how much further could margins improve and why?
"
905,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,20,"Yeah, I think -- basically, everything pales in comparison to the value of robotaxi or personal driving.
I mean, it's just -- I mean, that just tends to warm everything.
You just go from having an asset that is -- has a utility of perhaps 12 hours a week per passenger car to maybe around 50 or 60 hours a week to a five times increase in the utility of the asset.
The cost didn't change.
Yeah, so that's where just things just had, you know, just kind of put your mind.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the last question from investors is, Elon mentioned Level 4 autonomy could be achieved this year.
Is it based off initial FSD beta rollout experience, or is Level 4 ability predicated on Dojo being completed online?
"
906,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,21,"As mentioned earlier, Dojo is not required for full self-driving.
You know, it should have a positive effect on the cost of training networks.
You know, it's not just a question like does it get to full self-driving but really kind of like the ""march of nines"" of reliability, is it 99.999% reliable or 99.999999% reliable.
This is -- it gets nutty.
So, obviously, we want to get to close to perfection as possible.
So, frankly, being safe than human is a low standard, not a high standard.
People are very, very lossy, often distracted, tired, you know, texting.
Anyway, it's remarkable that we don't have more accidents.
So, it's -- yeah.
So actually being better than a human, I think, is relatively very forward, frankly, how do you be 1,000% better or 10,000% better.
Yeah, that's what, you know, gets much harder.
But I think anyone who's been in the FSD beta program, I mean, if they were just to plot the progress of the beta interventions per mile, it's obviously trending to, you know, a very small number of interventions per mile and pace of improvement is fast.
And there's several profound improvements to the FSD stack that are coming, you know, in the next few months.
So, yeah, I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving safer than human this year.
I would be shocked.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Let's go to analyst questions now.
And the first question comes from Jed from Canaccord.
Jed, feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question.
"
907,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,22,"Yeah.
To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will be -- will transition to an iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system.
Manganese is also, you know, could be part of the future, but primarily iron.
It just comes out iron-nickel.
We need something that is, you know, formed in a star before a supernova, ideally.
So, you know, iron is.
So that's because there's a ridiculous amount of iron on earth as is a ridiculous amount of lithium.
So you can really expect all stationary storage to transition to iron over time.
And like I said, with some -- manganese is like a wild card.
There's also not a lot of manganese.
And I should say like we did short-change the energy business last year, and that vehicle took priority over the energy side.
So --
"
908,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,23,"Absolutely.
And just to repeat Drew's point, we are still -- we still expect to be part or primarily chip-limited this year.
So that's the thing -- that's actually the driver.
"
909,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,24,"Yeah, on chip side, exactly. 
"
910,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,25,"So, yeah, we --  but -- we do see a very, you know, I mean, long-term probably terawatt-hour per year energy business.
So, a lot.
It's very vast.
Yeah.
"
911,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,26,"It's hard to predict 2022 because we still have lingering supply chain -- there are still lingering supply chain issues globally.
But I think the chip stuff -- at least the chip side of things appears to -- looks like it will alleviate end of this year or '23.
I mean, there are a crazy number of chip fabs being built, which is great.
The sheer number of chip fabs being built right now is exciting to see, yeah.
So there could be other issues.
We're trying to anticipate those as much as possible but, you know, predicting the future is difficult.
"
912,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,27,"Yeah.
We'll grow it this year, for sure.
It's just, you know, we -- if we're simply -- we're able to respond to demand, it might grow by like 200% or 300% or something, you know, as opposed to sort of 50% or something.
"
913,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,28,"Yeah.
"
914,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,29,"And it will naturally grow faster than the vehicle business once we can less shipthe --
"
915,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,30,"The damn chip constraint, frankly.
So it will grow like kelp on steroids, basically, on their own.
It needs to.
And our primary mission is to accelerate sustainable energy.
That's always been our primary mission, and we're trying to stay true to that.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
"
916,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,31,"Well, we don't have incubators.
"
917,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,32,"Research centers.
We don't have research centers.
"
918,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,33,"Yeah.
We work on things that go into our products.
Yeah, we're like this is a useful product that, you know, the world really needs.
And we're just like, ""Let's make this thing, design it up and iterate fast, and then figure out how to make this at scale at a reasonable price."" That last part is the super hard part.
You know, many times we've said prototypes are easy, production is hard.
We could work out that as a way of prototypes, but what's the point of that? Like you actually have to reach scale production and have cash and exceed cash out.
That's the super, super hard part.
"
919,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,34,"And that chip limitation should alleviate next year.
And then probably, we transition into a cell limitation battery, you know, total gigawatt-hours of cell limitation, which is when the 4680 will become very important.
"
920,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,35,"Yeah.
"
921,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,36,"It was just the same general societally with those way too much value placed on the idea.
It's like, you know, like the idea of -- like you have to have a kind of the idea of going to the moon.
That's what the hard part.
OK, going to the moon is the hard part by far.
And the thing is that that is true for really most products.
So this is just weighing too much value placed in the idea of -- versus execution.
And we have ideas -- we have a bazillion ideas.
So many ideas that we don't know what to do with.
We just sort through them and say, ""Which one are we actually going to go through in the blood, sweat, and tears of bringing to volume production."" That's the super -- and can we actually do that, right, that's tough.
"
922,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,37,"Yeah, exactly.
You want to tie it back with production, just like the office we're sitting in right now literally looks over the Giga Texas production line, like the offices are integrated into the factory.
"
923,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,38,"Yeah.
I think the FSD stuff, you really don't want to be looking at the rearview mirror.
It will not be a good indicator for the future.
This is what you need to look out the front windscreen, so -- because it is such a profound step change.
I mean, effectively long term, every car will have FSD.
And so -- and the value of that will be a very big number.
You know, it's like -- I just look at this as asset utilization.
You have a passenger car, which normally is driven maybe 1.5 hours a day on average, maybe 10 -- 10 hours, 10, 12 hours a week.
A lot of cars are in parking lots, so we're spending money, not just driving the cars but storing them all over the place.
We can get rid of a lot of parking lots if you have a car that is operating all the time.
But there will be a challenge with traffic.
So, you know, we like this little tiny baby company, The Boring Company, which I initially started as a joke, but now I think it actually could be quite essential to alleviating the insane traffic that will happen when cars are autonomous because you reduce the pain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number of cars on the road.
I mean, it's going to be -- I think it's way cheaper to point with robotaxi, which is an autonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past, three or four years will be capable of that than a bus or a subway.
It will cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.
So, if we want to get -- I'm not going to take the bus, you know, if it costs you, I don't know, for argument's sake, $2 to travel 10 miles point to point, nobody's taking the bus, especially in cold weather or it's dark or maybe a little bit dangerous or how bad, you know.
I just do not understand how profound a change this is.
It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
Millions of cars suddenly have about four or five times utility in the U.S.
overnight.
I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.
"
924,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,39,"Yeah.
I mean, it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of full self-driving is not fully appreciated.
If an asset has five times more utilization than the -- it's like dividing the cost of that asset by five.
So if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because, still, you don't want to drive.
So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
So it's probably better than five times, I don't know.
Yeah.
I mean, basically, if the cost of our cars do not change at all, we would still sell as many as we could possibly make.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
"
925,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,40,"Yeah.
"
926,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,41,"Yeah, we don't use 4680 at all for the iron upgrade cells.
"
927,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,42,"Well, last year was chip hell of many chips, so silicon carbide inverters or -- certainly one of them, but --
"
928,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,43,"Yes.
It's a ton of very simple control chips that run-of-the-mill, literally, you know -- 
"
929,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,44,"Yeah, basic chips to control.
"
930,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,45,"I think -- yeah.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And now, Zach has some opening remarks as well.
"
931,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,46,"Yeah, exactly.
Like the little chip that allows you to move your seat back and forth.
That actually was a big problem that can make these.
"
932,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,47,"So -- like -- but a lot of these things are alleviating.
I think there's some degree of the toilet paper problem as well, where, you know, there was a toilet paper shortage during COVID, and like, obviously, it wasn't really certainly a tremendous enhanced need for ass wiping.
It's just people panicked in order to -- and got every paper you could possibly wipe your ass with, basically.
I was like, ""Is this like a real thing or not?"" I actually took my kids to the H-E-B and Walmart in Texas to just confirm if this was real.
Indeed, it was.
And there's plenty of food and everything else, but just nothing, no paper products that didn't cause a split up.
So an odd choice for people to panic about.
And those things are -- actually, if end of the world is coming having toilet paper is the least of your problems.
So, I think we saw just a lot of companies over-order chips and they buffer the chips.
And so, we should see -- we are seeing alleviation in almost every area, but the output of the vehicle is -- goes with the least lucky.
You know, what is the most problematic item in the entire car is there's like, at least, 10,000 unique parts in the car, so waiting more than that if you go further off the supply chain, and it's just -- which one is going to be the least lucky one this time? It's hard to say.
"
933,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,48,"Yeah, exactly.
It's not a long-term thing because there's going to be -- there's a great amount of chip fabs being built, which is great.
Martin Viecha
Well, thank you very much.
Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for this session.
Thanks very much for all your good questions, and we'll speak to you again in three months' time.
Have a good day.
Bye, bye.

"
936,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,51,"I'd like to just second the thank you to suppliers.
A lot of suppliers worked late nights, weekends, vacations around the world, and we're very grateful for that.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
Let's go to the Q&A from the investor side.
The first question was on 4680 cells, which we already answered, so let's go to the second question.
How is the progress of the $25,000 compact car? Can you give an update?
"
937,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,52,"Well, we're not currently working on the -- on a $25,000 car.
We -- you know, at some point, we will, but we have enough on our plate right now, too much on our plate, frankly.
So, you know, at some point, there will be.
I think that's sort of a question that -- it's sort of the wrong question, really.
It's -- really the thing that overwhelmingly matters is when is the car autonomous? I think, at the point in which it is autonomous, the cost of transport drops by, I don't know, a factor of four or five.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
The next question from investors is, since we're talking product road maps today, how do you view domestic cooling and heating in the context of accelerating the sustainable energy transition, and how might Tesla's HVAC and heat pump advances fit it?
"
938,TSLA,2021,4,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer-and-product-architect,False,53,"You want to talk about that, Drew?
"
939,TSLA,2021,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hey, thank you for taking my question.
Can you hear me well?
"
940,TSLA,2021,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"I wanted to come back on battery.
So, it's great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with 4680 this quarter, and at the same time, that you don't really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant volume growth this year.
And the question I had is, you know, I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally, but I'd be curious to hear you talk about how you think about 4680 as being a form factor that your suppliers could adopt as well.
And how you see in the long run, in the greater scheme of things, you know, what does 4680 become? Is it going to be outside of Tesla as the largest form factor for batteries? Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the Megapack, in all your energy storage business? And do you expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?
"
941,TSLA,2021,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"OK.
Thanks.
And I have a quick follow-up on chips.
So you've talked a lot about all this shortage and the supply difficulties.
And I was wondering if you could give us some color on, you know, like the power chips you need for investors and all the power systems you're putting together versus like the more traditional logic chips, if the situation is different between the two? And should we understand from the situation today that you're working very hard also at expanding the scope of your suppliers? And should we expect like Tesla to take on board additional suppliers in the near term, especially on the power side?

"
944,TSLA,2021,4,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,1,"Sure.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680 effort to provide us flexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible.
As we sit today, sales from suppliers is actually -- it sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that you mentioned, Elon, in 2022, or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volume plans based on the information we have.
But we are making meaningful progress of the ramp curve in Kato.
We're building 4680 structural packs every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas.
I was driving one yesterday and the day before.
And we believe our first 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter.
Our focus on the cell, the pack, and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year.
And the 4680 and pack tool installations here at Giga Austin are progressing well with some areas producing first parts.
And the internet has also noticed that.

949,TSLA,2021,4,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,6,"Yeah.

"
957,TSLA,2021,4,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,14,"So everybody needs to be in the factory often enough to be able to understand that last part of the equation.

958,TSLA,2021,4,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,15,"And if you're in the research center --

"
961,TSLA,2021,4,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,18,"Yeah.
On the 4680 as a form factor, yes, we've engaged with a number of our, you know, partners or suppliers on the form factor and they're all working on it.
And, you know, they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also, ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
And -- so that's what's engaged -- I mean, we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor there, engaged because they think it's a good form factor, and we're -- we want people to make it for sure.
To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be.
And in the end, it's about cost competitiveness, scalability of manufacturing.
And when you compare like an iron cell with a nickel cell, for example, like there are some just physics-based differences in what happens in certain corner cases that would drive different form factors, and we just have to be cognizant of that and designed to that.
So it isn't like the ultimate form factor for all things.
There's other form factors that could be better for an iron cell, for example.
So --

On the power side, in particular, you know, it's still like an area of like technological development where the next chip can do the same thing with less diarrhea, so like the total fab required to accomplish the function goes down.
So there's still room to grow without needing more fab capacity.
But in general, there's a lot more fab capacity coming, so that's like a win-win there.

"
971,TSLA,2021,4,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,28,"Yeah.
I think from a mission perspective, it's very aligned.
If you imagine replacing natural gas, water, and space heaters with electric heat pumps, it offsets something equivalent to like 80% of what a solar plus Powerwall system would offset, so it's very impactful.
And we have learned a lot about how to make capable and reliable heat pumps that work in all environmental conditions, and are excited about the idea of working on that problem one day.
Let me put it that way.
It's definitely aligned with our mission to transition to sustainable -- accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.

How do you organize the R&D, you know, efforts so that you can start talking about all these new products? Is there like an incubator or some type of thing like that? But just structurally, I'm curious about that.
Thank you.
"
977,TSLA,2021,4,ben-kallo,baird,True,1,"Thank you.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
"
978,TSLA,2021,4,ben-kallo,baird,True,2,
979,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah.
Thanks, Martin.
As Elon mentioned, 2021 was a financially transformative year for the company.
If we look across the full year '21 and compare that to 2020, our automotive gross margin, excluding credits, rose by over 600 basis points, enabled by work on cost reduction, utilization of our Shanghai factory for exports, and accelerating demand.
Opex as a percentage of revenue reduced despite the impact of one-time items and unique items, and operating income more than tripled, with operating margin reaching our guidance of mid-teens, and these margins are trending up.
We also saw regulatory credits accounting for a relatively small portion of our 2021 profitability, which we expect to continue to reduce in materiality going forward.
For Q4, specifically, automotive gross margin, excluding credits, increased to 29.2%, which is our highest yet.
We do continue to see some impact of higher pricing on certain models and trims as was the case in prior quarters.
But please keep in mind that due to backlogs, changes in pricing will generally impact our financials in future quarters.
Supply chain challenges and port congestion resulted in a significant increase in our expedite costs in Q4.
We also took reserves associated with warranty and recall costs.
Operating expenses were meaningfully impacted by stock-based compensation from the final two tranches of the CEO stock grant becoming probable and payroll taxes associated with the exercise of the 2012 CEO options.
The total impact of these payroll taxes, warranty and recall costs, and excess expedites was just over $700 million in the quarter.
Our free cash flows have remained strong, reaching record levels in Q4 of $2.8 billion despite increased capex.
In addition to using cash to grow the business as quickly as we can, we have been retiring legacy and high-interest debt.
Note that we plan to continue to utilize the ABS market for product-specific financing.
As we look forward, we expect 2022 to be another significant and exciting year for the company.
We continue to drive for vehicle volume growth at or above 50%, as Elon mentioned, and our plans show that this is actually achievable with just our Fremont and Shanghai factories.
For quite some time now, these factories have been running below capacity due to macro challenges with supply and logistics.
As Elon mentioned as well, from what we're seeing, the pace of growth in 2022 will, again, be determined by supply chain and logistics, which is quite difficult for us to forecast.Despite these constraints, it's important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we are prepared once limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future.
This will result in higher fixed and semi-variable costs in the near term, in addition to the usual inefficiencies as we ramp a new factory.
We are also seeing inflation and rising commodity prices, which we expect to continue to put pressure on our costs.
How this specifically impacts gross margins in the near term is uncertain, given a mix of both tailwinds and headwinds.
However, we do expect to continue to see stronger operating margins as we grow our volumes and improve operating leverage.
Over a longer-term horizon, we are quite optimistic about the expansion of margins, though.
From the hardware side, we are aggressively driving manufacturing innovations and operational efficiency to reduce cost.
And with the rapid development of FSD, software-based profits will ultimately become a strong addition to the profits generated by selling hardware.
So congratulations to the Tesla team for a terrific 2021, and thank you to our suppliers who supported us.
Looking forward to another great year.
"
980,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
We currently offer Tesla insurance in five states in the U.S.
Four of them are telematics, which is Texas, Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona, and then California, which has a more standard insurance offering based upon regulations there.
"
981,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"And the closer you are to applying blood, sweat, and tears to actual production, the faster you'll be able to bring new things into actual production.
"
982,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,
983,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah.
And that's evidenced by what we're seeing in Texas. 
"
984,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"We've been in this market now for about three months.
And what we see in the data is the frequency of collision by folks who are given a feedback loop on how they are driving is quite a bit lower than the frequency of collision otherwise.
"
985,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Exactly. 
"
986,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"And so, we see that so far in Texas.
Take rates have been quite strong.
We measure this on the conversion rate from when folks quote to see what their monthly rate would be at the starting point to what percentage of them purchase.
So we're very encouraged by the interest that we're seeing in Texas.
And then we have enough history in Texas to see what does the loss ratios look like and how do the economics of the program work.
And, you know, we're on the right track there as well.
So we're comfortable with what we've seen in Texas to move as quickly as the intent to scale this across the U.S.
Specifically on the question about when we will be in all states, you know, this is a slow process because of insurance being regulated at the state level, and so we have to go through each of those processes with each of the departments of insurance in each state.
But our internal goal here, by the end of the year, is to be in enough locations that 80% of our customers within the U.S.
could choose to sign up for Tesla insurance if they wanted to.
There's a lot of uncertainty around that based upon the regulatory processes, but that's our goal.
And then, as we make more progress rolling out in the states and each incremental state becomes a little bit less effort than the prior, that's when we'll turn our attention to the Europe market.
We might be able to do that by the end of the year, starting to get work on Europe by the end of the year.
We'll have to see how we progress in the U.S.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your current factories, Freemont, Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin? And timing for new factory announcements?
"
987,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yeah, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the company.
And they're in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
So, our mix of Model Y is increasing, you know, as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model 3.
And so that is helpful on our margins.
And then as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve and the costs go down as well.
The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the company.
And, you know, the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we've also -- that factory had a different line design, more efficient from the start, and we've been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
So, that has been helpful.
If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model X.
And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.
And then, we've also done various price increases in certain markets on certain models, which has helped there.
So, that's generally the story at a high level.
You know, as we look over the next a quarter or two, as I mentioned in my opening remarks in the last call as well, you know, we have ramp inefficiencies from the launch of Austin and Berlin.
We also have pressures coming from inflation, supply chain, raw materials, etc.
And so, you know, where that nets out is hard to say in the immediate term.
And we obviously, as a company, are going to be driving to increase margins as much as we can.
But I just want to be realistic that we're launching two factories simultaneously here and it unavoidably will add cost to the business as we do that.
And as we look further out, and Elon mentioned this in his opening remarks as well, you know, the software portion of the business, I think, is the one to really pay attention to.
As full self-driving features get rolled out to more and more folks, I mean, for me, personally, I prefer to drive my car with the FSD data on, and I think as more and more people experience that, take rates there, and then as we work toward the robotaxi space, there's actually quite a bit of upside on margins from a software perspective.
"
988,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
I mean, I think it's exactly that.
I mean, it's a question of does it double, triple, quadruple? I mean, either way, I think, you know, our plans are pretty ambitious for Megapack this year and storage in general. 
"
989,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"The exact amount of growth is hard to know.
But ultimately -- I mean, to Elon's point about the growth of this business, I mean, we need to be growing it faster than the vehicle business.
"
990,TSLA,2021,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yeah.
"
991,TSLA,2021,4,jed-dorsheimer,canaccord-genuity,True,0,"Hi, thanks, and congratulations on a great year.
Elon, I guess, my question is around the Megapack or your energy business.
And so, as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, you have two different strategies, or it seems like with Megapack and Powerwall, and I think the Powerwall was answered with 4680 and the 2170 opening up.
So, I was wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect for that.
"
992,TSLA,2021,4,jed-dorsheimer,canaccord-genuity,True,1,"That's helpful.
Thank you.
So you what -- do you see that '22 is kind of the opening of that -- the energy business reaccelerating?
"
993,TSLA,2021,4,jed-dorsheimer,canaccord-genuity,True,2,
994,TSLA,2021,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,0,"Can you hear me OK?
Martin Viecha
Yeah.
We can hear you.
"
995,TSLA,2021,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,1,"Perfect.
Can you talk a little bit about your strategy around anode materials and your ability to leverage that into a reduction on the cathode side and performance from [Inaudible]
"
996,TSLA,2021,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,2,"That's super helpful.
And then just around the vehicle pricing strategy, obviously, there's a lot of flexibility there for some customers and not -- can you just talk a little bit about the process around vehicle pricing? And how quickly do you expect to change that and adjust as you see some of these commodity prices flow through the cost structure and you look at the brand dynamics for vehicles?
"
997,TSLA,2021,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,3,
998,TSLA,2021,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,0,"Sorry about that.
Do you hear me now?

Sorry.
Yes.
We can hear you now.
Perfect.
"
999,TSLA,2021,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,1,"Sorry about that.
OK.
Yeah.
Just actually kind of following up on a question before.
You had mentioned commodities are rising.
And when I look at a lot of the key, you know, raw materials in the battery, cobalt, nickel, lithium, all up 40%.
And I know you guys have done a good job of getting long-term contracts to sort of mitigate that impact.
I mean have you seen so far any impact from that spike? And if not, I mean any sense of when that raw material headwind might actually show up or has shown up?
"
1000,TSLA,2021,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,2,
1001,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,0,"Yeah.
Thanks, Martin.
Early next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural, battery, crash, range, and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter.
Testing is -- to date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture and unknown unknowns may exist still.
Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the pack timeline I just mentioned.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The second question from an institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023? What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
"
1002,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,1,"At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect but how quickly can we process the data we've collected.
This is where Dojo comes in, as we mentioned on AI Day.
With substantially faster training computer in Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now if, for instance, say, the training and that takes one day instead of one week makes a huge difference in our ability to push out more updates.
But realistically, there's a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster iteration.
So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The next question is, can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet will be necessary to achieve 20 million in annual volumes? The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over 1 million units.
So, is it possible to achieve 20 million units with just S, X, 3, Y, truck, and the $25,000 car?
"
1003,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,2,"Yeah.
And on the Supercharger side, the supercharging team monitors congestion and plans expansion to ensure customer experience with minimal wait times alongside the growth in our vehicle fleet.
While we certainly have work to do in expanding capacity in some congested areas, average congestion on the network has decreased over the past 18 months.
Nonetheless, we're not standing still.
We are executing accelerating expansion plans globally.
The network has doubled in the last 18 months, and we are planning to triple it over the next two years.
And even so on an individual-site basis to combat existing congestion more quickly where it is isolated and problematic, we expedite local relief sites, deploy mobile Superchargers, and we try to introduce pricing strategies that encourage more off-peak usage to avoid the waiting.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
"
1004,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,3,"And we've also maintained an ongoing road map on software improvements, dynamic routing to avoid busy Superchargers.
That's actually really helpful.
We take the real-time busyness of the stations into account when choosing where to navigate people on their road trip.
And beyond that, we're also continuing to improve the trip planner itself and how it estimates how much energy people use so it's not too conservative in asking people to charge more than they need to, which is another thing that can delay a total trip.
Martin Viecha
Great.
Thank you very much.
The next question is, is Tesla considering any other ideas, other than FSD, with real-world AI that can bring additional software revenue to Tesla? If not, can Tesla consider building interesting games around FSD beta?
"
1005,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,4,"Sure.
At AI Day, we did talk about a potential future where Dojo could be used as a neural net training platform for other companies.
It's not a focus of ours today as we're fully subscribed on Dojo with our internal uses.
We do expect to continue to improve the in-car experience in the context of FSD.
Martin Viecha
Great, thank you.
And maybe last question from shareholders is, how does FSD take rate -- how has FSD take rate changed since the introduction of monthly subscription? Are there any plans to increase FSD pricing as wider release becomes imminent?
"
1006,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,5,"Yeah.
Certainly, our goal is to localize all key parts of the vehicles on the continent -- at least the continent, if not closer to where the vehicles are produced.
So that is our goal and we're working with -- you know, internally and with our suppliers to accomplish that goal and not just at the end-assembly level but as far upstream as possible.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And the next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
Colin, are you able to unmute? OK.
While we're waiting for that, let's go to the next one.
"
1007,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,6,"And diversification, right? You know, like it doesn't need to be nickel or cobalt or -- I mean there's always another option.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Colin, do you have a follow-up question? OK.
Let's go to the next one.
The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
"
1008,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,7,"Sure.
I don't know that I'm going to get into too many specifics, but I guess first, one thing I would say is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in the same situation just in terms of what their constituent components are.
So there's less of a focus on like rapidly changing them one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities.
There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode.
Like there's a fundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function.
So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that it doesn't, in any way -- that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impeding on the long-term cyclability of the product.
It can also help with energy density.
As you like sort of improve the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell, not directly 1-to-1 because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better.
And that's a focus as well but the trade space is just sort of cycling versus day one cost.
"
1009,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,8,"And on the differences between Austin and Berlin, there are some.
They're largely associated with the different sort of building architectural choices that were -- happened to occur in collaboration with like local codes and other sort of governing requirements that drive the differences in the architecture between the locations.
In general though, like we're trying to progress the manufacturing system as a system and make sort of logical, like, path to find improvements from factory to factory.
And in some cases, there was an improvement identified between, like, decisions for one, Austin; the other, Berlin; or vice versa.
And so there might be a slightly newer iteration of one part of the factory in one place than the other, but they're -- it's all part of a -- like a path forward in the factory that builds the machine -- the machine that builds the machine, sorry.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And the last question comes from Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord.
"
1010,TSLA,2021,3,drew-baglino,senior-vice-president,False,9,
1011,TSLA,2021,3,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,0,"Thanks, Martin.
Yes.
We're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
I think Zach spoke to that well.
And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexity to the business.
We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell-constrained world.
While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin, Berlin, ramping S and X further in Fremont to restore to past levels while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai.
As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
And that timing, of course, depends on increasing cell capacity both from our suppliers and through our in-house cell as well as many other headwinds we face in the supply chain and completing our currently full plate of products on the table.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The third question is, with FSD beta training data sets set to explode exponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
"
1012,TSLA,2021,3,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,1,"Thanks, Martin.
Yeah.
As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the best-selling luxury sedan worldwide.
And as we mentioned at our shareholders' meeting, Model Y is poised to be the best-selling vehicle in the world.
Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments, and we hope to do so with each new product.
As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle lineup to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and midsize, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so, along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The next question from a retail shareholder is, what is Tesla's goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin, and Berlin, by 2024?
"
1013,TSLA,2021,3,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,2,"Thanks, Martin.
Yes.
As we have been for years, we always engage with NHTSA and other worldwide regulatory bodies to share our knowledge and to work with them on our approaches on both active and passive safety.
There are ongoing regulatory inquiries taking place all the time and especially on the subjects like FSD that are at the cutting edge of technology development.
During these investigations, my team, myself are always cooperative as much as possible.
We expect and embrace the scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance and the innovations our products have will ultimately be all that matters.
In the end and as I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs.
This is because our primary motivation is from -- coming from a team of incredible engineers designing software and hardware that saves lives and prevents injuries.
In doing so, we'll continue to be transparent to the public on how our technology is both developing from an Autopilot safety data, the latest of which we just shared in the shareholder update, and you can also see and review a wide variety of customer post FSD videos on social media.
Back to you.
Martin Viecha
Great.
"
1014,TSLA,2021,3,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,3,"Yeah.
Thanks, Martin.
We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
We've been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers a while back.
As you may have seen recently in social media, we've built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design.
And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer, there are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements though the product is largely true to the initial vision.
We'll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we're in now and look to launch that by next year.
Martin Viecha
OK.
Thank you very much.
We just promoted Pierre to a presenter.
Can you hear us?
"
1015,TSLA,2021,3,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,4,"Yes.
If I can add to that, it's really exciting for the engineering team to see the finance team taking on safety into their world, too.
It's just pervasive.
Thanks for that, guys.
"
1016,TSLA,2021,3,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,5,"Sure.
I mean as I said earlier, we always cooperate fully with NHTSA and other regulatory bodies in any sort of investigation they may have, particularly related to ADAS systems.
When they came out with the standing general order in July, we were quick to respond to that and one of the first and only companies capable of actually meeting the needs of that report.
We continue to send that information to them as required, weekly, and as incidents occur.
And with the additional investigations, as I said, we meet that with great sincerity.
And we'll work through them one by one to make sure that all the facts come out and that NHTSA is well informed about our strategies for both active safety in this case but also passive safety.
As you guys may know, we released updates to our airbag and restraint system last week to Model Y using our fleet data.
We worked closely with NHTSA on that, and they were fully in the loop before we did it.
So I think these kinds of things will continue to happen in the new regulatory space that Zach discussed as we move toward a software-based vehicle.
And we're happy to be a part of that journey.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.
"
1017,TSLA,2021,3,lars-moravy,"vice-president,-vehicle-engineering",False,6,"Yeah.
Sure.
So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior of Cybertruck to meet both the durability and corrosion requirements required for an automotive world.
With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.
We have made some early sourcing decisions in that, but I think we'll keep that one internal, and we've already begun the first casting-ins of that.
Rolling stainless isn't so different from pulling any other material.
It's just about how hard the rollers are to get to that hardness level.
And, you know, just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with our suppliers and vendors to make sure those timelines and supplies meet the need and demand of our customers.

Yeah.
We can hear you.
"
1020,TSLA,2021,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"Amazing.
I'm very impressed that you managed to figure that out like --
Martin Viecha
We have to.
"
1021,TSLA,2021,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"I would have panicked.
Anyway, let me ask you my question.
Actually, I'm very intrigued by what you guys are doing on the insurance front.
And so you have now in the market in Texas an insurance product for which the premium varies as a function of the safety score of the driver.
And so I'd love to hear you about that.
You know, you must have some initial data points about market reaction.
What's the update? And from there, can you tell us about how you think you're going to distribute that? Is that going to go through your installed base very easily? Or is it going to be like a heavy marketing push? And then maybe tell us about your expansion plans.
What are the next geographies? What's the timing? How fast is that business line likely to grow in the next few years?
"
1022,TSLA,2021,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,3,"No, I think I'm fine.
Zach, thanks for taking the time to answer.
It's fascinating and very interesting, yes.
I look forward to looking into that.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC.
"
1023,TSLA,2021,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,4,
1024,TSLA,2021,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,0,"Testing.
Can you hear -- 
Martin Viecha
Yeah.
We can hear you.
"
1025,TSLA,2021,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,1,"Yeah.
No.
It's -- by the way, great to hear there's a team at Tesla, not just a one-person show.
I want to drill down a bit more on FSD.
In December of 2020, in a Business Insider interview in Germany, your leader said that he expected Level 5 autonomy by December -- within a year.
So that would be now.
Yet we look at the progress in FSD and some of the issues you see on YouTube, and it looks very much like a Level 2, two-plus system that requires vigilances, in fact, your disclaimers cite.
So I guess three questions, kind of one, what is the timetable to get to Level 4 at least capability? We can deal with the regulatory stuff later.
Two, what is the criteria, for Zach, for you to release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD? And is having a Level 2 system that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue? And then three, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you plan to work with the new -- with the folks at NHTSA who appear to be asking some questions.
They have three requests out to you regarding information around the Level 2, around the capabilities of FSD.

1027,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah.
Thanks, Martin.
We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3.
Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same quarter last year.
We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars toward the end of the quarter.
The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.
Additionally, we have made great progress increasing production volumes of Model S and have recently started the ramp and deliveries of Model X.
It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes, but based on demand, we are targeting to exceed historical production levels.
We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year to date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve.
I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
This team's expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference when managing through these challenges.
Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible.
I also want to thank our suppliers for their dedication and partnership to Tesla.
Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.
The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
Similar dynamics are also playing out on our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts and cells allow us to do so.
Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program, and we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excluding regulatory credits, which is our strongest yet.
This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.
The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin, and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.
As was the case in Q2, there was some net benefit from pricing actions.
However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials.
Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program.
Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds as was also the case with FX this quarter.
While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which should help to compensate.
Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to benefit from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption.
As a result of the great progress on margins, volume, and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve an operating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously.
On cash, we generated record operating cash flows of $3.1 billion and continue to invest heavily in the buildout of manufacturing, supercharging, and service capacity.
We also continue to retire high-interest rate debt, including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during the quarter.
As we look forward, we are clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our target annual growth rate of 50% this year.
Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, but we are driving for continued growth.
We are also nearing assembly of our first production cars in Austin and Berlin.
It's important to stress, while the first production car is an important milestone, the hardest work lies ahead in the ramp.
Please keep in mind that we are pushing the boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these factories, which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp.
These factories will also partially weigh on our margins as we work toward volume production.
Overall, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished and I'm excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022.
The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time while also continuing to improve our precision and pace of execution.
Thank you.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And we will now take questions from institutional and retail shareholders that we posted on our website.
The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with 4680 cells?
"
1028,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
Thanks, Martin.
You know, our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.
And so you can extrapolate that out.
You know, there may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that.
There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that.
But that remains the long-term goal of the company.
In Fremont, you know, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there.
Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production.
And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%.
I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that.
As we look toward Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue to ramp production there as well, so most recently the ramp-up of the Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
We'll continue to ramp that factory.
And, you know, our plans there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y, but we've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand.
And so we'll take Model Y at these factories.
You know, we're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can.
And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.
And then we'll add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
So, you know, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.
We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye toward a 50% annual growth rate.
Martin Viecha
Great.
Thank you very much.
The next question is, what is your view on the tightening regulatory environment for FSD, the investigation, and broad data request by NHTSA? Some of the recent nominees to NHTSA have been publicly critical of FSD, including engaging with short sellers online.
How will you manage this environment?
"
1029,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yeah.
We have achieved -- we've actually exceeded our long-term guidance on our operating margin target.
So we're very pleased to see that.
And as we look out over the next quarter and the next year, there's kind of -- there's a number of puts and takes financially for the company.
The launch of Austin and Berlin, we'll have ramp inefficiencies there for some period of time until we get those factories up and running.
And so that's likely to put some downward pressure on our margins as those factories ramp.
Our goals are to ramp those as quickly as possible.
But as Drew mentioned earlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through.
We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure.
So we are seeing cost increase on the commodity side.
We're getting feedback from our suppliers, as we are seeing ourselves, the impact of labor shortage.
And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be a part of our story here, and it's uncertain how that will unfold.
It's our hope that these things stabilize.
Exactly when that happens is difficult to predict, and we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost.
And so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.
So it's difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.
With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a company on managing our overhead expenses and operating expenses.
And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining, and I expect that trend to continue to happen.
And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next four or five quarters.
As we think kind of forward, the business up until this point has kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a little bit of software on top of that.
As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there's considerable upside both on gross margins, and operating margin as that comes to light as the business starts to become more of a mix of a hardware-based company and a software-based company.
So we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, just a little bit difficult over the next four to five quarters.
We'll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information.
There's just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now.
Martin Viecha
Thank you.
Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
"
1030,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
We have seen an impact.
Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum, nickel on the cell, aluminum on non-cell.
And we have a mixture of contracts with various suppliers.
Some materials, we contract directly and we have full exposure to price fluctuations.
We do have a number of long-term commitments -- long-term contracts in place.
We also have contracts where there's some amount of cost-sharing based upon the movement of indexes.
And so as these have been moving, some of those costs have been flowing through to us.
It's not a substantial amount of cost but it's not small.
As we look toward the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible that we continue to see more of cost headwind as a result of these movements.
It's difficult to say precisely, but, you know, the volatility and the increases are just substantial -- so substantial.
And there are certain suppliers that, maybe up to a certain point, have been absorbing some of the increase.
And as contracts expire there or we have to renew and extend them, we'll have to return to negotiations.
And so, you know, what we have to do as a company and what we are intensely focused on is we need to be continuing to drive down the cost of our products, which we have been doing.
And we have to overcome cost increases that are outside of our control.
So whether that's resourcing components or redesigning components or finding ways to be more efficient in manufacturing, we have no choice but to continue on that path and be even more aggressive in the light of the macroeconomics here.
"
1031,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah.
Pricing has been a really difficult thing for us over the last couple of quarters.
And we're -- part of the challenge is -- well, I mean the great thing that we're seeing in the space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening of the desirability for electric vehicles.
And I mean to be totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard.
And that kind of awakening and changing consumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electric car and folks want to buy a Tesla right now.
It's very exciting for us.
At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a number of dynamics, as we've talked about in great detail.
And we are putting an extreme effort to build as many cars as we possibly can.
It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are.
It's quite the grind.
We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand that we're receiving.
But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacity fast enough.
So at the same time, we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure, as we've discussed previously on the call.
So what we're trying to think through -- you know, if somebody orders a car now, it will -- it could be delivered, in some cases, depending upon the car and which factory, could be a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters.
And the timing in which we build that car will be just before that car gets delivered.
And what will the world look like at that point? And so we're trying to think through, how the cost structure is evolving, how does pricing need to change with that, what are the supply dynamics in the space.
The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time.
The difference is that when Tesla changes pricing, it's extremely transparent, where that's not always the case otherwise.
And, you know, sometimes, our pricing will increase.
Sometimes, our pricing will reduce.
Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense.
But, you know, there is a strategy that we work behind the scenes as we're balancing supply and demand, as we're also trying to balance various shortages on parts, as we're trying to manage wait times.
All of that goes into the optimization here.
Martin Viecha
OK.
Thank you very much.
The next question is from Brian Johnson from Barclays.
Brian, please go ahead and you can unmute.
"
1032,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
Thanks.
We'll take them in order.
You know, it's difficult to be specific on the timelines.
The Autopilot team is working extremely hard iterating on every version.
We are being extremely transparent through the release of this to public customers who are posting information online.
So when you're using full self-driving and you're going through the iterations, you can feel the progress.
And for those who don't have it in their cars, social media is excellent at getting a sense for how that's progressing.
And the team is moving quickly with every iteration, with every update, and they're working very hard on that.
On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue, the way that this works is we have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at the time that a customer has purchased that.
And so what we have to assess is, have we met those commitments? And is the software widely available to folks that we've made those commitments to within a certain geography? And, you know, given that FSD is still currently in the beta phase, it's invitation-only and it's limited, we have not deemed that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue.
And we'll continue to evolve this.
We'll continue to monitor it within the finance team to see when we get to the milestones in which we're comfortable releasing.
On the NHTSA question, Lars, do you want to take that?
"
1033,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Sure.
So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our first production cars before the end of the year.
You know, we've talked about this a bit, you know, the unknown unknowns, new factories, new vehicle designs, new technologies, new locations, new teams.
So, you know, there is quite an execution journey ahead of us.
But that remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that.
We -- for -- we should not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we do produce them -- so homologation, regulatory reasons.
And we'll want to make sure that we build up some number of cars that we're confident in the quality and the customer experience around them.
The second thing that I'll say -- and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of the newness here, it's extremely difficult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like.
And it's possible things -- the stars align and things move quickly.
It's possible that we're spending the bulk of next year working on ramping these factories.
It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue to update you all through these calls and through other forums.
As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difficult because that is a function of the ramp, which is uncertain.
So the benefit here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared to other factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarter that is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable and growing margins there.
The same is also true in Shanghai.
So I expect we'll see some amount of headwind on margin from these ramps.
It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able to ramp and what uncertainties come up during the process.
"
1034,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"I mean we are carrying some amount of costs associated with the factories today.
And so the incremental cost associated with turning the factories, it's not 100% of a factory, if that's what you're getting at in your question.
"
1035,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yeah.
We also actually saw a very similar dynamic to this when we were launching Model S earlier in the year.
So, you know, when a product starts launching and then cost of goods sold starts to activate, depreciation starts to activate, there's a bit of a movement in the P&L as to where that cost resides, so yes, assuming to some extent Brandenburg and Austin costs are already flowing through our P&L.
But we still need to continue staffing and ramping and incurring all the operating costs associated with the factory that we're not spending right now.

1037,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Just to add to that, I mean, as Lars said, safety is extremely important for Tesla.
It's the right thing to do.
And, you know, if you look at various independent testing and regulatory testing of our products, you can see the work of incredibly talented engineers in the results of those tests.
And, you know, our goal in developing safety-oriented software around the car is to continue to go beyond what the hardware is able to provide.
If you can prevent a crash from happening, that's the safest way to manage this.
And I think at a macro level here, what we're seeing -- and this is entirely understandable and expected, is that the automotive industry is going through a transition from the traditional car as we know it to more of a computer, software-oriented, sensor suites around them that can manage things beyond just what the driver manages.
And regulatory bodies are -- understandably so, are interested in understanding how to regulate in this environment, and NHTSA is no exception to that.
So as Lars mentioned here, I think this is a great thing.
We're excited to partner and we'll work collaboratively with all regulatory bodies who want -- to go on the journey to the transition to a software-oriented vehicle.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
The next question is, service remains an issue with appointments available weeks or even months out.
Likewise, Supercharger wait times have become untenable at some locations.
What concrete steps is Tesla taking to improve the customer experience in these two key areas?
"
1038,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yeah.
I'll take the service part of this question.
Drew, you can take the supercharging part.
We have seen an increase in service wait times throughout the summer.
And there's a couple of things that have contributed to that based upon the information that we have.
The first is that -- and I think this is kind of not -- this is not unique to us, is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened, I think, more quickly than most people expected.
And what we're seeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased.
There may have been some demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off, and so there's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring.
That has increased demand for service.
At the same time, in the macro-environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts has become increasingly more difficult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labor market.
And so this kind of the simultaneous increase in demand for service with the ability to supply that service has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned.
And so we saw an uptick primarily in Europe and North America in service wait times over the course of the summer.
And we've been working extremely hard since then to address this, and we've seen our wait times come down.
So this is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspective, we are seeing improvements there.
We remain super-focused on adding locations.
And so over the last year, we've grown our physical footprint of service centers by 35%.
We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%.
We're also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and demand for service.
But I think the most important part about all of this is -- and we've said this on calls before, where the best service is no service.
And so we have been incredibly focused as a company both on the initial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles.
And we've seen pretty substantial improvements in both of those metrics over the long term and over the last couple of quarters.
So it is something that remains on our minds.
We monitor this very closely.
But hopefully, that's a helpful explanation into the context and what we're doing.
"
1039,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"And one -- just one thing to add on supercharging.
If you haven't experienced our latest iteration of battery packs that can handle fast charge rates in combination with our 250-kilowatt charging stations, it's pretty incredible.
And this is a really important component to supercharging capacity because the faster you can charge, the more charge sessions that you can have on an individual post, the better the customer experience is as you're going on a long-term journey because your supercharging times are lower.
So this is a really important part of the strategy.
Supercharging team has done a great job rolling these out, but it requires a combination of both the 250-kilowatt charging and our latest iteration of battery packs.
"
1040,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"I'll take the second part of the question first.
We won't be providing any kind of forward-looking commentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term.
With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to unpack within the company.
I mean what I'll say just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments is that the things that we learn on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant.
This is really more of a platform for when FSD beta goes into wide release and the features and functionality become more accessible to more customers.
The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription, and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD option into your lease or your loan, on a monthly basis, the most economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and rolling it through their financing.
And as a result of that, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate of FSD when people purchase cars.
We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it through that route.
But again, as I said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant.
We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features.
Martin Viecha
Thank you very much.
And now, let's go to analyst questions.
[Operator instructions] The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Pierre, feel free to unmute your mic and go ahead.
Pierre, I think your mic is muted.
OK.
While Pierre works on that, let's go to the next analyst.
The next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC.
Joe, we cannot hear you.
Can you click unmute? OK.
While the team is working on that, let's just go back to say.com questions.
So the next say.com question is, can Tesla allow for FSD to be transferred to another vehicle at a fee, something less than $10,000? Early adopters are paying the price if they want to upgrade their vehicle.
You lose the value on the trade-in and now you have to buy in at a higher cost.
"
1041,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"I don't think that this is widely known, but we're already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.
If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there's a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD compared to one that doesn't.
And so there's that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
That money can then be applied toward the purchase of a new car.
So I just -- you know, we hear this feedback quite a bit.
We see it on social media.
We see it in the forums, etc.
And so this already does exist, not directly in the form here and we don't call it out explicitly in the trade-in potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in as a result.
And hopefully, this clears this up because we do actually do that. 
Martin Viecha
OK.
And the next question is, Elon said that we'd get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
"
1042,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Thank you, Pierre.
"
1043,TSLA,2021,3,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"Yeah.
Thank you, Pierre.
I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product.
We have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probably listening to the call.
So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre.
So I mean at the highest level here, you know, we entered the insurance market kind of unintentionally, I would say.
Our customers were coming to us, complaining that the price of traditional insurance was too high and it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla.
And part of our journey here at Tesla is we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products.
That's extremely important to achieving the mission of the company.
And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentage of what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high.
And we spend extreme amounts of effort in manufacturing to take $5 of BOM cost out here or $10 out somewhere else.
If we can get, you know, $5, $10, $20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of the price of the car if you finance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms of affordability.
And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into this.
As we started to do more research, essentially, the tools by which the insurance is traditionally calculated are optimized based upon the existing data, but the existing data is limited.
So they -- there's a focus on things like marital status or age or other attributes like that.
Accident history is a good one, etc.
But what essentially happens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually file many claims end up overpaying on their insurance relative to their cost.
That overpayment then goes to riskier customers who are essentially being subsidized.
And, you know, as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought this just doesn't seem like it's fair.
At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there's enormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driver who's operating that car and whether those attributes correlate with safety because we do get a signal when a car has been in an accident.
So we've been spending our time looking at, you know, hundreds of different variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history.
And we've been able to fit a model that is able to predict, with decent accuracy, the probability of collision over a period of time.
And the model is not perfect, right? The model is a function of the data that we have available.
That data set continues to grow.
We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a model that works pretty well so far.
And from that model, being able to predict frequency of collision, we can then align that against the price curve.
And we can have individualized pricing integrated into the car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience with a feedback loop back to the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful on or unsuccessful on, in the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety.
So that's what we've developed.
We then included the safety score as part of the FSD beta enrollment program, where we have almost 150,000 cars currently using a safety score.
And I believe the latest data is over 100 million miles of driving.
So we've been able to go back and analyze that data.
And we've learned two things coming from that.
The first is that the probability of collision for a customer using a safety score versus not is 30% lower.
It's a pretty big difference.
It means that the product is working and customers are responding to it.
The second thing that we've looked at is what is the probability of collision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score.
And that is aligning with our models.
Most notably, if you're in the top tier of safety compared to lower tiers, there's multiple X difference in probability of collision based upon actual data.
So this is a very new and very exciting frontier for us.
I know that was long-winded, but I -- we spent a lot of time on this and we put a lot of thought into it.
Specifically, with respect to the rollout, the insurance industry in the U.S.
is intensely regulated and it's regulated on a state-by-state level.
That means that we require regulatory approvals from each individual department of insurance at each individual state.
Texas is the first state that we launched in.
I do want to thank the Texas insurance regulators here.
You have been great to work with.
We have a road map of additional states.
We will launch the product in those states as we receive regulatory approvals.
And our goal is to be in every major market in which we have cars in.
The -- we did a soft launch in Texas.
Was it last week? Yes.
And what we're seeing in initial take rate data is that if you compare that to what we're seeing in California, we're off to a good start here.
So we're very excited about it.
We're excited about individual risk-based pricing.
We're excited about the ability for folks to become safer and, as a result, save money.
And it feeds into our priority of a company -- of building the safest products in the world.

Martin Viecha
Yes.
We can hear you.
"
1046,TSLA,2021,3,jed-dorsheimer,canaccord-genuity,True,1,"Hey, thanks for taking my question.
So, Brandenburg, I'm just wondering, Zach, if you could estimate the carry costs from a margin perspective.
Or I guess in two parts.
So when do you expect -- do you still expect production coming on in '21, so a couple of months left in December? And how do you see that margin impact as a function of the carry cost? And I do have a follow-up question.
"
1047,TSLA,2021,3,jed-dorsheimer,canaccord-genuity,True,2,"Sure.
So on a margin per car -- but I would suspect though if your carry cost is full right now on the -- that as you start producing vehicles, it's going to be a margin lifter from where you're at right now, no?
"
1048,TSLA,2021,3,jed-dorsheimer,canaccord-genuity,True,3,"Yes, yes.

1051,TSLA,2021,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"Perfect.
So Zach, as you noticed -- or as you noted, you hit low teens operating margins.
That was your medium-term target.
You're there now despite the number of challenges and not full utilization in some of the plants.
So how are you thinking about that target now? Does it allow you to either drive price down further to unlock more demand, invest in other initiatives, or does that target need to change? And then longer term, do you have an aspirational gross margin target as the mix of software and hardware changes?
"
1052,TSLA,2021,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,2,"Yeah.
The second question is just you mentioned LFP packs globally for standard range models.
My understanding is that all comes from China.
Is that the continued go-forward plan? Or do you want these LFP capabilities in other factories around the world?

1054,TSLA,2021,3,trip-chowdhry,global-equities-research,True,0,"Very good quarter.
I had two quick questions.
First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.
How are the two factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines? And the second question is related to Cybertruck.
Who is the supplier looking at if you look at the exoskeleton steel? Is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp-up, say, in '23, '24 time for Cybertruck? That's all from me.

Your cost of goods sold per vehicle is already down to the mid $37,000 range in the quarter, it's down $5,000 year over year despite some of the inefficiencies that you talked about.
And I know that a lot is going to change from here just given how mix is going to evolve.
But if you're successful on the structural pack and front and rear castings in the launch of the 4680 cell, can you just maybe give us a sense of what a successful outcome would look like maybe a year from now? Obviously, a lot has to go right.
But just any kind of broad framework for us to think about.

We're working through some improvements that we need to make to that equipment and to the actual raw material itself to not have those limitations.

With the Cybertruck, we're redefining how a vehicle is being made.

1092,TSLA,2021,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Thanks very much for taking my question.
I have another question, actually, on batteries, but on a slightly different angle.
I was wondering how you're looking at your sourcing strategy for the 4680.
You've talked a lot about all the work you're doing to develop your in-house production.
But what about asking other battery manufacturers to do 4680 cell with their own technology? Maybe less innovation than what you guys are lining up internally.
And I was wondering if the first 4680 cells that we see on the road will definitely come from Tesla's own manufacturing lines, or whether it could be coming actually from outside suppliers as well.
And I have a quick follow-up.
"
1093,TSLA,2021,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"OK.
Great.
Thank you.
And I have a quick question.
I know, Elon, you don't think it's meaningful today, but I'd be curious to know if you have any thoughts about when you announced the new pricing on the FSD ring from 10,000 and thrown to 199 without looking.
I'd be curious to understand how it's affected behavior in issues, so like a massive effect, affecting the service.
And I'm not thinking about people looking at it as a message, but more to try the most advanced version of autopilots, and to try it.
In the first days, even on the pricing, have you seen a very significant spike in the tech rate? And can you give us a sense of how big it was?
"
1094,TSLA,2021,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"No, my question is from the time you announced the subscription at $199 the amounts, how much did the tech rate increase like the vested people who basically took the subscription about the new car? That is how it was when they had to pay 10 grand upfront.

1096,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Sure.
So to recap, Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.
We achieved record production, deliveries, and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the first time in Tesla's history.
I'd really like to congratulate everyone in Tesla for the amazing job.
This is really an incredible milestone.
It also seems that public sentiment toward EVs is at an inflection point.
And at this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward.
Regarding supply chain, while we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious.
For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain, which is the wide range of chips that are at various times the slowest parts in the supply chain.
I mean it's worth noting that if we had everything else, if we had the best numbers of vehicles themselves, we would not be able to make them.
Everything except the chips, we won't be able to make them.
The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output.
It is difficult for us to say how long this will last because we don't have -- this is out of our control essentially.
It does seem like it's getting better, but it's hard to predict.
So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort from people within Tesla.
We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks.
It's not just a matter of swapping out a chip.
You also have to rewrite the software.
So it was an incredibly intense effort of planning new chips, writing new firmware, integrating it to the vehicle and testing it in order to maintain production.
And I'd also like to thank our suppliers who work with us.
And there have been many calls midnight, 1:00 a.m., just with suppliers that -- in resolving a lot of the shortages.
So thanks very much to our suppliers.
Let's see, in terms of FSD subscription, we were able to launch Full Self-Driving subscription last month, and we expect it to build slowly and then -- but then gather a lot of momentum over time.
Obviously, we need to have the Full Self-Driving widely available for it really to take off at high rates and we're making a lot of progress there.
So yeah, I think FSD subscription will be a significant factor probably next year.
With regard to Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, we're actually doing this earnings call from Giga Texas.
So we're in the factory right now doing this earnings call.
And the team has made incredible progress here.
You can see the pictures online and see that there's basically nothing a year ago and this -- a large -- a mostly complete large factory a year later.
So it's really great work by the Giga Texas team and then also great work in Berlin-Brandenburg with the team there.
So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limited production later this year.
It's always like it's not -- it's hard to sort of explain to people who have not been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp, like why can't you just turn it on and make like 5,000 a week.
This is -- it is so hard to do manufacturing.
It is so hard to do production.
First approximation, there are 10,000 unique parts and processes that have to work, and the greater growth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things.
And a bunch of them are not even in our control.
So it's like -- it's insanely difficult.
I'm fond of saying that prototypes are easy, and production is hard.
And arguably, the really remarkable thing that Tesla has done is not to make an electric car or to be a car start-up because there have been hundreds of car start-ups in the United States and outside United States.
So the thing that's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go bankrupt in reaching volume production.
That's the amazing part because everyone else did because the prototype or the idea was the hard part, and it is not.
It is trivial by comparison with actual production.
So it's always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only two that have not gone bankrupt, and that is Ford and Tesla.
So the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory, and we must be careful that we cannot do that.
They're often -- if you look at the -- if you look at the history, so often, the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory.
We will endeavor not to make that the case at Tesla.
So let's see, the Model Y in Texas -- made in Texas and Berlin will be -- will look very much like the Model Ys we currently make, but there are substantial improvements in the difficulty of manufacturing.
So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front body and a cast rear body, whereas the one in California has cast rear body but not a cast front body.
We're also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680 cells, which is a mass reduction and a cost reduction, but we're not counting on that as the only way to make things work.
We have some backup plan with a non-structural pack and 2170s essentially.
But at a scale production, we obviously want to be using 4680s and structural pack.
From a physics standpoint, this is the best architecture, and from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest-cost way to go, so the lightest, lowest cost.
But there's a lot of new technology there.
So it is difficult to predict with precision when does it work and when do you reach scale production.
And Drew is going to talk a bit more about the 4680 productions.
Yeah, so we are making great progress on 4680 cells.
But there are -- there is a tremendous amount of innovation that we're packing into the 4680 cells.
And so it's not simply a sort of minor improvement on state of the art.
There are -- and we went through this on the battery cell day, really dozens of -- half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements.
So I think it will be great, but it's difficult to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved.
So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed, which is very difficult.
We have had some factory shutdowns due to part shortages, and we hope those will be relieved in the coming weeks and months.
And we're making great progress on Full Self-Driving.
Some of the progress is not easy to see because it's actually at the foundational software level, and so it ends up being sort of two steps forward, one step back situation.
But over time, you should do two steps forward and one step back and keep going, keep moving forward.
So I'm highly confident that the cars will be capable of Full Self-Driving.
Full Self-Driving computer and the cameras, I'm confident that they will be able to drive themselves with the safety levels substantially greater than that of the average person.
Once again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla and an incredible quarter.
Thanks, guys.

1097,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,1,"OK.
"
1098,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Yeah, exactly.
In Europe and China and most parts of the world, it's the same connector for everyone, so this is a fairly easy thing to do.
We developed our own connector, which in my opinion is actually the best connector, it's small and light and looks good and above standard.
So we developed our own connector, which in my opinion actually the best connector.
It's small and light and looks good.
So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America.
But people could buy this adapter.
And we anticipate having it available at the Superchargers as well if people don't sort of steal them or something.
"
1099,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,3,"OK.
So that's a constraint on North America.
That's basically a vestige of history.
But I think we do want to emphasize that it is our goal to support the advent of sustainable energy, it is not to create a wolf garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is sometimes used by some companies.
"
1100,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yeah.
"
1101,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
Obviously, in order for this to be -- for the Supercharger to be useful to other car companies' cars, we need to grow the network faster than we're growing vehicle output, which is not easy.
We're growing vehicle output at a hell of a rate.
So Superchargers need to grow faster than vehicle output.
This is a lot of work for the Superchargers team, but it is only useful in the grand scheme of things.
Just only useful to the public if we're able to grow faster than Tesla vehicle output.
So that is our goal.
"
1102,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Really, this is not -- we'll definitely make the 4680 reliable enough for vehicles, and we, I think, are at the point where, in limited volume, it is reliable enough for vehicles.
Again, going back to limited production is easy, prototype production is easy but high-volume production is hard.
There are a number of challenges in transitioning from sort of small-scale production to a large volume production.
And not to get too much into the weeds of things, but right now, we have a challenge with basically what's called calendaring, or basically squashing the cathode material to a particular height.
So it just goes through these rollers and gets squashed like pizza dough, basically, but very hard pizza dough.
And it's causing -- it's denting the calendar rolls.
This is not something that happened when the calendar rolls were smaller, but it is happening when the calendar rolls were bigger.
So it's just like -- we were like, OK, we weren't expecting that.
"
1103,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
"
1104,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yeah.
"
1105,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Exactly.
"
1106,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Meantime, we have a massive amount of equipment on order and arriving, for the high-volume cell production in Austin and Berlin.
But obviously, given what we've learned with the pilot plant, which is in Fremont, which is really quite a big plant by most standards, we will have to modify a bunch of that equipment.
So it won't be able to start immediately.
But it seems like -- Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, but we think, most likely, we will hit an annualized rate of 100-gigawatt hours a year, sometime next year.
"
1107,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Yeah, I mean my guess is more likely than not, above 50% of reaching 100-gigawatt hours a year by the end of next year on the annualized rate, something like that. 
"
1108,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Yeah, it's just worth reemphasizing that -- the extraordinary difficulty of ramping production of large manufactured items.
With a risk of being repetitive, it is essentially easy to make prototypes, or sort of handle small volume production.
But anything produced at a high volume, which is really what's relevant here is, it's going to move as fast as the slowest of the say rough order magnitude 10,000 unique parts and processes.
And so you can have 9,999 and with just one missing.
I mean we're missing -- for example, like a big struggle this quarter, was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts.
And obviously, you cannot ship a car without those.
That limited our production severely worldwide in Shanghai and in Fremont.
So it wouldn't have mattered if we had 17 different car models because they won't need the airbag module, so it's just irrelevant.
So in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that's meaningful for customer deliveries, we've got to solve the chip shortage working with our suppliers.
And someone would say, why don't you just build a chip fab? Well, OK, that would take us, even moving like lightning, 12 to 18 months.
So it's not like whoop out a chip fab.
Like, yeah, look, a chip fab.
So some of these things are -- yeah, anyway, it is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints of scaling a large manufactured object.
I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling.
I think we might be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object.
Maybe the Model T would have been comparable back in the day of the Ford Model T.
Probably internet knows the answer, but I think we may be scaling large manufactured object at the fastest rate in history.
Or I would like to know who did it faster, so we can learn from them.
So t's worth just noting that in the grand scheme of things, it's not bad.
So the Cybertruck and Semi, both are heavy users of cell capacity so we've got to make sure we have the cell capacity for those two vehicles, or it's kind of pointless.
We can make a small number of vehicles, but the effect of cost if you make a small number of vehicles is insane, like they would literally cost $1 million apiece or more.
There's a reason why you do things in volume production, which is to get the economies to scale and get the cost down.
So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year.
But it's not like in January 1.
It comes through -- it ramps up through the course of next year.
But even without Tesla cell production, with our suppliers, we'll be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year.
Andrew, do you want to talk more about that?
"
1109,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,13,"It could shift by a little bit, but as Drew mentioned, nothing fundamental, just a lot of work.
"
1110,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Yeah, I guess I'll do an interview.
I mean, just bear in mind, like if I'm doing interviews tonight, I can't do actual other work.
Only so much time in the day.
But yeah, I'll do it once.
I won't do it annually, but I'll do it once.
I think also, I'd like -- this is the last time I'll do earnings calls, but this is the -- I will no longer speak, default, during earnings calls.
So obviously I'll have to do the annual shareholder meeting, but I think going forward, I will most likely not be on earnings calls unless there's something really important that I need to say.
"
1111,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,15,"I think Cybertruck ramp will be difficult because it's such new architecture.
I mean it's going to be a great product.
It might, I think be our best product ever.
But there's a lot of fundamentally new design ideas in the Cybertruck.
Nobody's ever really made a car like this before, a vehicle like this before.
So there will probably be challenges because there's so much unexplored territory.
"
1112,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Well, like I said, I think we might be the fastest growing company in history for any launched manufactured item.
Those who have not actually been involved in manufacturing ramp-up just have no idea how painful and difficult it is.
It's like you got to eat a lot of glass.
And for our manufacturing ramp, it's hard.
"
1113,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,17,"It took longer than that.
Took longer than that, about a year.
"
1114,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Yeah, I mean, for Shanghai, it's an incredible team built the factory in nine months, but it took longer than -- longer than building the factory.
It took longer than that to actually reach volume production -- a high volume production.
So it took about a year.
And when you put a factory in a new geography, in order for that factory to be efficient, you have to localize the supply chain.
So there's no such thing as cut and paste.
It does not exist.
And it would obviously be insane to do vehicle production in Europe and send vast numbers of parts from North America.  That would be -- that would make the producing in Europe, for example, just crazy.
You got to look like the supply chains have efficiency and then you're moving as fast as your least lucky, least good supplier.
Yeah.
Some of these supply chains go like three or four layers deep.
Frankly, I feel at times that we are inheriting all force majeure of Earth.
So if anything goes wrong anywhere on Earth, something happens to mess up the supply chain.
Yeah.
"
1115,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,19,"We are exponentially growing.
"
1116,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Yeah.
It's also -- it takes a while to hire old people and train old people to operate a factory.
A factory is like a giant cybernetic collective.
And you can't just hire 10,000 people and have them work instantly.
It's not possible.
I really encourage more people to get involved in manufacturing.
I think, especially in the U.S., this has just not been an area where all that many smart people have gone into.
I think U.S.
has an over-allocation of talent in finance and law.
It's both a criticism and a compliment.
I'm not saying we shouldn't have people in finance and law.
I'm just saying if there might be -- maybe we have too many smart people in those arenas. 
"
1117,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Yeah, manufacturing is great.
It's a very interesting problem to solve.  And obviously, you can't have stock unless someone makes it.
That's how you get stock.
Yeah.
"
1118,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,22,"Yeah, we don't have a lot of ideas on this to be frank.
Really, Full Self-Driving is the main thing.
Things are obviously headed toward fully autonomous electric vehicle future.
And I think Tesla is well-positioned and in fact is the leader objectively in both of those arenas, electrification and autonomy.
It's always tempting to try to find analogies, but with other companies, or whatever.  But really, the value of fully electric autonomous fleet is generally gigantic, boggles the mind really.
So that will be one of the most valuable things that's ever done in the history of civilization.
"
1119,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Yeah.
"
1120,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Yeah, it's not worth commenting on right now.
It's not meaningful.
We really need Full Self-Driving at least the beta to be widely available so anyone who wants it can get it.
Otherwise, it'll be pointless to read anything into where things are right now.
So, yes.
"
1121,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,25,"At least in the U.S., we don't see regulation as the fundamental limiter.
We've obviously got to make it work and then demonstrate that the reliability is significantly in excess of the average human driver for it to be allowed -- for you to be able to use it without paying attention to the road.
But I think we have a massive fleet.
So it will be, I think, straightforward to make the arguments on statistical grounds, just based on the number of interventions, especially in events that would result in a crash.
At scale, it will have billions of miles of travel to be able to show that it is the safety of the car with autopilot on is 100% or 200% or more safer than the average human driver.
At that point, I think it would be unconscionable to not to allow autopilot because the car just becomes way less safe.
It would be sort of like shake the elevator analogy.
Back in the day, we used to have elevator operators with a big switch that -- they operate the elevator and move between floors.
But they get tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted and every now and again, somebody would be kind of sheared in half between floors.
That's kind of the situation we have with cars.
Autonomy will become so safe that it will be unsafe to manually operate the car relatively speaking.
And today obviously we just get an elevator where we press the button for which floor we want, and it just takes us there safely.
And it would be quite alarming if those elevators were operated by a person with a giant switch.
That's how it would be with cars.
"
1122,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,26,"Yes, it's really difficult for us to make specific predictions is very difficult.
I think we felt confident of say at least a few percent growth year over year next year.
And maybe 200%.
But that's -- we need a lot of crystal balls to figure out exactly what it's going to be.
And it is literally impossible to make a specific prediction.
But at least 50, maybe 100, something like that.
"
1123,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,27,"Yes.
"
1124,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,28,"Yeah.
We're going to have programs as dry cathode, I mean, I don't know, maybe it's like 10 or 15% of the cost of equipment or something like that? I don't know, 20% maybe.
"
1125,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,29,"Yes, so it's like people don't think like this is like the Messiah or something, wet versus dry reduces.
To dry is like 10% less cost than wet.
So it's not 10% slow, nothing to sneeze at, especially if you're making hundreds of gigawatt hours a year.
But it's not the Messiah, basically.
"
1126,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,30,"Yeah, we are, in fact, working with our existing suppliers to produce 4680 format cells.
And this is just a guess right now.
But I see us sort of like consolidating around a 4680 nickel-based structural pack for long-range vehicles.
And then not necessarily a 4680 format, but some other format for iron-based cells.
So right now, we kind of have the Baskin Robbins of batteries situation, where there's so many formats and so many chemistries, that it's like we've got like 36 flavors of battery at this point.
This is just -- this results in an engineering drag coefficient where each variants of cell chemistry and format requires as to an amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits our forward progress.
So it is going to be important to consolidate to maybe -- ideally two form factors, maybe three, but ideally two.
And then just one nickel chemistry and one iron chemistry, so we don't have to troubleshoot so many different variants.
"
1127,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,31,"Yeah.
We do expect to see significant increases in supply from our existing suppliers in addition to the cells that Tesla's making.
So it's both.
Sometimes, I get questions from our cell suppliers with like, are we going to make all the cells ourselves? We're like, no, please make as many as you possibly can and supply them to us.
We have a significant unmet demand in stationary storage.
Megapack is basically sold out through the end of next year, I believe.
"
1128,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,32,"We have a massive backlog in Powerwall demand that man to Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch.
Now part of that problem is also the semiconductor issue.
So we used a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as you do in a car, so it's like, which one do want to make? Cars or Powerwalls? So we need to make cars, so therefore Powerwall production has been reduced.
But as the semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwall production.
I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of a million units of Powerwall next year, maybe toward on the order of 20,000 a week.
But again, dependent on cell supply and semiconductors.
But in terms of demand, I think there's probably demand for in excess of a million Powerwalls per year.
And actually just a vast amounts of the Megapacks for utilities.
As all transitions to a sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent and by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity.
And when you look at all the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of batteries that are needed.
That's why in the long term we really think sort of combined Tesla and suppliers need to produce at least 1,000 gigawatt hours a year, and maybe 2,000 gigawatt hours a year.
"
1129,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,33,"OK.
Are you asking like if the FSD tech rate is too expensive and that's why we're doing subscription? Or I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly.
"
1130,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,34,"Yeah.
It's worth telling like if you have a target of a certain number, that doesn't mean it happens like as sure as night follows day.
It's a target.
So if there is some calamity in the world that interrupts the supply chain, then it will be less.
But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers call for roughly a doubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022.
And we have to juggle these exponential -- it's a whole bunch of exponential graphs sort of overlaying on top of each other.
And small changes in where you are on the x-axis of time can quite substantially change the area under the curve.
So what we're thinking of doing depending on -- is basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then as we have say excess cell supply in one month or another, then routing that so outputs to the Megapack and Powerwall.
Well, by the same token, if we're prioritizing vehicle production, If there's a shortage of cell upward for some reason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production.
So it could be something's got to give, basically.
"
1131,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,35,"Yeah.
I mean, any given price is going to be wrong, so we'll just adjust it over time as we see the value proposition makes sense to people.
So we're just really -- I'm not thinking about this a lot right now.
We need to make Full Self-Driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition.
Otherwise, people are kind of betting on the future.
Like right now, does it make sense for somebody to do FSD subscription? I think it's debatable.
But once we have Full Self-Driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear.
And at that point, I think basically everyone will use it, or it could be a rare individual who doesn't.
"
1132,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,36,"All right.

1134,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,38,"Yes.
"
1135,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,39,"Yes, exactly.
There is a tremendous amount of inertia in the supply chain.
So if we say to the supplier, we want you to double cell output.
Well, even doing that in a year, it's very difficult.
And then that system has a tremendous amount of momentum.
It is like a plateau of supertankers.
It's insane.
"
1136,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,40,"Yeah.
Exactly.
"
1137,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,41,"Exactly.
As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part to be at the highest place in the supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing.
And there's somehow a misconception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don't.
Apple uses I think almost 100% cobalt in their batteries in cellphones and laptops.
But Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries.
On a weighted average basis, we might use 2% cobalt compared to, say, Apple's 100% cobalt.
Anyway, it's really just not a pack.
We expect to basically have zero cobalt in the future.
I do -- I think probably there is a long-term shift more in the direction of iron-based lithium-ion cells rather over nickel.
As the energy density sort of iron ores or iron phosphate, might as well support iron phosphates.
They're taken for granted.
But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cells, and nickel-based lithium-ion cells.
I think probably we'll see a shift -- my guess is probably to two-thirds iron, one-third nickel, or something on that order.
And this is actually good because there's plenty of iron in the world.
There's an insane amount of iron.
But nickel, there's much less nickel, and there's way less cobalt.
So it is good for relieving the long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells, mostly.  And I think long term, possibly all -- there's a good chance that all stationery storage that is Powerwall and Megapack move to iron.
This is most likely the case since you do not need to transport it, and there's lesser volume and constraint for stationary storage.
So then nickel would be really for long range, road transports, ships, and aircraft, and that kind of thing.
"
1138,TSLA,2021,2,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,42,"Yes.
We're currently thinking it's a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app, and you go to Supercharger.
And you just indicate which stall you're in.
So you plug in your car, even if it's not Tesla.
And then you just access the app and say, turn on this stall that I'm in for how much electricity.
And this should basically work with I think almost any manufacturer's cars.
There will be time constraints.
If the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more because the biggest constraint at the Supercharger is time, how occupied is the stall.
And we'll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the Supercharger.
So rush hour charging will be more expensive than off-hours is charging because there are times when the Superchargers are empty and times when they're jam-packed.
And so it makes sense to have some time-based discrimination.

And now let's go to the retail investor questions on say.com.
The first question from Robert M.
is Tesla's website still says Cybertruck production is expected to begin in late 2021.
Can Tesla share more details on the current status of the Cybertruck and confirm if production is still again expected?

Let's go to the second question from retail, which is Elon has said that Tesla will be opening up the Supercharger network to other EVs later this year.
Can you share some more details on how this will be structured, will this be a select brands, or will they contribute to the growth of this network?
"
1150,TSLA,2021,2,martin-viecha,"senior-director,-investor-relations",False,11,"Yeah.

I think question two and question three, we can skip given we have already addressed it.
I'll go to question four.
In five years' time, how much faster or better could you be at manufacturing capacity expansion using current pace? And what are the biggest issues you need to solve to get to that rate?
"
1155,TSLA,2021,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah.
Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon.
Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business.
In particular, auto gross profit and margin, excluding credits, increased substantially.
This was primarily driven by better cost optimization across our factories, good execution against our cost reduction plan, as well as increases in production and delivery volumes.
There was some benefit from pricing actions, mostly in North America.
However, it was small in the context of the other contributors.
Note that the Model S and X program was at a slight loss for the quarter due to the relatively low volume.
And supply chain challenges, including expedites, continued to provide cost headwinds.
Additionally, it's encouraging to see the progress made on profitability within our energy and services and other businesses.
While there's some benefit to looking at our progress quarter over quarter, I find it more helpful to look at progress over a slightly long-term horizon.
Over the last two years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled.
This volume increase was made possible by a steady decrease in ASPs of more than 10%, driven by a road map to increase affordability and shifting mix toward our more affordable vehicles.
Yet over that same period of time, our auto gross margin, excluding credit, has increased nearly 10 percentage points to our highest yet since the introduction of Model 3.
This is only possible because our average cost per vehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price.
This is a remarkable achievement in the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction as mentioned and a testament to the hard work by the Tesla team.
Additionally, opex as a percentage of revenue has declined, and in particular SG&A, representing the work we've done to become more efficient as we scale the company, while still making the required R&D investments to support our future.
As a result, our GAAP operating margins have risen from negative to double-digit, in line with what we have guided.
By managing our overhead costs and driving higher volumes, our P&L is benefiting from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit.
Or said differently, we are recognizing the benefits of scale and improved fixed cost absorptions.
With strong operating cash flows and cash balance, we are putting that cash to use.
Capex continues to tick up, primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin, and Shanghai.
Additionally, each quarter, we are using our cash to retire legacy debt, which was taken on at a time when interest rates and company risk were much higher than in today's environment.
As I've mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew toward the second half of the year as we push for continued sequential increases in volume.
Despite the great work so far managing the instability of the supply chain, these challenges remain and are unfortunately increasing in pain with the higher volumes.
As we work through the uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best to manage customer wait times, as well as the impact these interruptions have on our employees and costs.
And as Elon mentioned, volume growth will be determined by part availability as we have the factory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position.
I'm excited to see the progress made by the Tesla team as we continue building the business and strengthening our financials.
Thank you very much.
"
1156,TSLA,2021,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
This is Zach here.
I think we're still early in understanding how FSD subscription will unfold.
But a couple of data points here.
We took a look at our backlog to see of customers in our backlog who have ordered FSD, did they cancel presumably to go to subscription after they take delivery? And the level of cancellations there, we're not seeing cannibalization there, it's possible that that changes, but that was also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199.

1157,TSLA,2021,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,
1158,TSLA,2020,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks, everybody.
I hope everyone's safe and healthy.
I got one question, one follow-up.
And I'd point out, I've had a root canal before, and I would agree, Elon.
It was less painful than buying a car.
"
1159,TSLA,2020,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"It's a big problem, actually.
It's a big problem.
Different conversations.
Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April? Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
"
1160,TSLA,2020,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"Elon, on that point, you mentioned people that gave their lives to build the country, my thoughts for you on this.
There have been a lot of comparisons drawn to the state of the US economy in the early 1930s when Roosevelt began a series of new deals and infrastructure projects, or post-World War II when Eisenhower launched the U.S.
Highway Act and when JFK launched the Apollo Program, which you could say was influenced by the Cold War, clearly, and you benefited from and our space program benefited from.
What would be your message to US lawmakers on this call as we -- in addition to your opinions on shelter-in-place, but thinking longer term, your message to US lawmakers coming out of the crisis, specifically around EV infrastructure and a chance to kind of work with taxpayers to support sustainable transport and renewable energy? I'm wondering if you see this as a chance to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost not be in vain.
Thanks.
"
1161,TSLA,2020,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,
1162,TSLA,2020,1,gene-munster,loup-ventures,True,0,"Congratulations on the progress.
And Elon, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year.
I would love for you to walk through the rollout strategy of the Tesla Network app and how that's going to look prior to the robotaxi stage? Are you going to gradually take over human routes with autonomous capable routes over time? Or how do you see that playing out?
"
1163,TSLA,2020,1,gene-munster,loup-ventures,True,1,"So, to summarize, we want -- we're going to give owners full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year.
Then a human is in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year? Would that be the hope?
"
1164,TSLA,2020,1,gene-munster,loup-ventures,True,2,"With a person -- initially a person who observes, would that be with the Tesla Network app, would that be really part of the year of 2021? Is that the hope?
"
1165,TSLA,2020,1,gene-munster,loup-ventures,True,3,"Okay.
And then kind of take it to its end stage, the robotaxi stage.
Any high-level thoughts to understand the regulatory is a massive unknown? But if you're going to put a guess on it, where would we -- when will we start seeing robotaxis?

1167,TSLA,2020,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hey, thanks for taking my question.
One on gross margin, first.
I know your impressive performance in Q1.
So there are three moving parts, the tailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y is ramping, even if it broke even, it probably took average gross margin down.
And, of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the last week of the quarter.
It probably was the sort of an extra cost.
And so, when I looked at how gross margin evolved sequentially, excluding these three moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margin could have been up like a couple of points sequentially.
So, I wanted to check with you, if that estimate would make sense.
And then I will have a follow-up on energy storage.
Thank you.
"
1168,TSLA,2020,1,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"Thanks.
And I had a quick follow-up on energy storage, if you can hear me well.
I think like -- I can't remember -- I think from the very first days I heard you on the call, you've always mentioned that demand for energy storage is always outstripping supply, and you have more orders than you can make.
And so, I'm kind of thinking there will be -- there should be an inflection point in that business at some point, and it's going to be driven by your ability to add much more manufacturing capacity like battery manufacturing capacity.
And at a high level, how are you thinking about that inflection point in terms of timeline?

1185,TSLA,2020,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,15,"The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
"
1186,TSLA,2020,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,16,"Thank you.
The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so they can qualify for the subsidy?
"
1187,TSLA,2020,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,17,"Thank you.
The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
In which way has Tesla improved toward -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?
"
1188,TSLA,2020,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,18,"Thank you.

"
1190,TSLA,2020,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,20,"Thank you.
And now let's go through the questions from retail investors.
Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for the next five to 10 years? This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030.
Is 40% or more realistic target?
"
1191,TSLA,2020,1,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,21,"Okay.

"
1192,TSLA,2020,1,benjamin-kallo,robert-w.-baird-&-co.,True,0,"Hey, thank you very much.
Just wondering about the cell strategy.
In Reno, you have, obviously, integrated there.
But you're buying cells I think, in Shanghai and what we think in Germany.
And so, how are you looking at that going forward? And then, can you just talk about Mr.
Mizuno and that Board addition and kind of the process with adding him to the Board? Thank you.
"
1193,TSLA,2020,1,benjamin-kallo,robert-w.-baird-&-co.,True,1,"Yeah.
I was asking about Mr.

1196,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah.
Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned significantly ahead of schedule.
This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
It's hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.
Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3's built in Fremont.
This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.
We also announced a long-range end performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest ever backlog yet again.
Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first ever Q1 profit.
Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
We continue to make progress on opex efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
We also experienced expected launch inefficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overall profitability.
As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers to generally increase with time.
This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accounts receivable on the balance sheet.
Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary -- by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing toward a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows.
As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.
We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the Company.
In Fremont, we're working toward restarting production as soon as that's possible.
We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2.
Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time.
The Tesla team has done a great job here.
We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.
Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important long-term investments.
It's important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial work we've done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
"
1197,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Agree.
And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is -- will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of time.
So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option up front.
And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
"
1198,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"And 3 and Y have like MERV 16 or 15 capable filtration.
"
1199,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
Use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other way around.
So lots of options.
"
1200,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"New technologies.
"
1201,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
It's a fair question.
I don't have any additional color to provide.
So $8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we're managing it very closely.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the end of Q1.
So we're making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity.
And as we've been looking at liquidity, we've been looking at this over the next 18 months, and there's ups and downs to the liquidity.
Currently now, as we're not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we're paying off.
But then in a couple of months, we'll quickly be through that, and then we'll have a gap in payables since we don't have any parts coming in.
So it does go up and down a little bit.
But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we're managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the Company.
"
1202,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Sure.
A couple of thoughts there for Y.
The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3.
And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
And so, that helps create some of the margin.
And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady state mix.
But it's similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3 when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
The commonality is huge.
It's very important.
And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well.
And so, we have experience with that both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
"
1203,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Sure.
From a sales perspective, with all the partners we've had historically in the future, we're just looking for competitive technology and competitive pricing.
I think we'll talk a little bit more about this at Battery Investor Day like how we're approaching all of it.
But yeah, I mean, we don't have like one model we're restricting ourselves to pursue.
We're just trying to find what's best for the products and -- in the long run.
And then the other question about the Board?
"
1204,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Sequential market improvement -- margin improvement.
"
1205,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
So the three things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full question here because we're having a bit of network difficulty in the room.
I'll do my best here.
So when we look at margin, we do exclude credit, as you have, so I agree with that.
Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.
So, it was lower than the overall average, and that will increase with time.
And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont also weighed on margin.
And the Shanghai margin was below the average as well.
Even though it's increasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average.
And so, I think the sentiment of your question was, if you were to remove those factors, was there a sequential increase in gross margin? I haven't specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right.
We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned.
And in particular, S and X gross margins continue to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher fixed cost amortization.
So there's good progress happening, both on the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for our products and production.
And I think this also lends itself to the power of the gross profit contribution to the Company once we get through these ramp inefficiencies, we get Fremont up and running again, we increase capacity so we can spread out fixed costs and continue to execute on cost reductions on our products, we feel very optimistic about that path going forward.
"
1206,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Yeah.
In terms of timeline, I think what we've been doing with both our partners and internally is looking at how to reduce the -- fundamentally the cost of investments in new cell capacity because when you look at a car -- a vehicle product, there's a lot of things in the vehicle besides the cells.
When you look at an energy storage project -- product, it's really just the cells.
And so, to really grow the energy storage business, it's all about cell investments.
And so, that's what we've been focused on.
And I think not to give too much away, but that will be one of the things we address in Battery Investor Day is how we're focused on that.
And when we have that in the place we want, it will be a lot easier to scale that business.
"
1207,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,
1208,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Yeah.
And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities there.
And so we'll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
"
1209,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"Yeah, I agree with that, Elon.
The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think is great.
The other one that I would add is, it's always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.
"
1210,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"Yeah, So touchless delivery, mobile service touchless sales has been something that we've been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.
"
1211,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"And many customers do that.
"
1212,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"So there is a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving.
And so, currently, in North America, it's sold for $7,000 as an option.
We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into deferred revenue.
That's associated with features that will be released with time.
Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow.
It's a little bit over $600 million.
And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been released, associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.
"
1213,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,17,"I'll also add that our Gigas have gotten bigger.
"
1214,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,18,"And...
"
1215,TSLA,2020,1,zachary-j.-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,19,"Yes, with multiple products as well.
And so the absolute number of Giga factories, we may ultimately build might be less, but each one is larger.
And that's under our belief that just significant efficiencies by having as much as possible, and similar product lines under the same roof, and as much vertical integration as possible all in one facility.
"
1216,TSLA,2020,1,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Hi, good evening.
A question on Model Y.
I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume.
How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3? What other factors should we think about? And what does that mean for the ampler for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?
"
1217,TSLA,2020,1,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,
1218,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thank you.
So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping two major products.
What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
After all -- after the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
Most surprisingly -- in other words, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to early access users in March and to all US customers with full self-driving package just last week.
Our cars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at this point.
This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month.
All of those confirmations are training on neural net, essentially, the driver when driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive, and making the neural net better and better.
I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined.
I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
It's the reason I say it's very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is training Google all the time with their searches.
So, when you're searching something and you click on a link, you're training Google every time you do that.
It's very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.
So, all those confirmations are training on neural net, and soon cars will be able to drive through an intersection without a confirmation, as well as to make turns.
And we really feel we're -- I feel extremely confident that it will be possible to do a drive from your home to your office, and most of the time with no interventions by the end of the year.
So, this is -- we can almost do this already with the leading edge AlphaBots [Phonetic] that are driving in the car.
So, let's see.
On other technology fronts, we increased the range of Model S and X yet again.
This time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X.
Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, ATA left, the car door opened and the keys in the car.
So the car -- and they did this overnight.
And so, the car actually went into a waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range.
And as a result, it had a 391 test.
As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually confident that we will achieve a 400 mile or greater range with the Model S.
But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles.
And, of course, we're not stopping there.
We're continuously [Phonetic] pushing for improved range over time and improving, handling, acceleration and all those details that make Tesla special.
For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece rear underbody casting that we are going to be making a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which is no casting of the size of complexity has never been done before.
In fact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
So, we're really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural, engineering and manufacturing.
I'm very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
It's better in every way essentially.
We also -- for Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
So the Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement.
We are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the Company.
And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to, and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.
Thank you.
"
1219,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably toward the end of this year.
I should say, it will still make sense as -- to buy FSD as an option as, in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future.
And we are confident that it is an investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
"
1220,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
I think very few people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with -- it sort of came out of nowhere.
So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure event, but quite massive, I think, 40% is the likely number.
It's possible that is 40%.
I would be very shocked, if it's less than 40%, even with force majeure, short of World War III.
"
1221,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"I think we will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month.
We may not -- as soon as next month.
This is not a prediction, just saying.
That's -- that could happen.
It will certainly be within three months and possibly one month.
And that would be in the US.
So as for how many will be in five years, I'm not -- I don't know right now what that number would be.
I guess, several more than there are today.
But I'm not sure, what exactly it would be in five years, but some number more than today.
"
1222,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yes.
"
1223,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"It could arguably -- it could start being called Tera.
"
1224,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"We were actually gaining interest momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but, and COVID essentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits.
The permit offices were closed.
And with the shelter-in-place all over the places, so we obviously cannot install and -- if you can't get permits, then you can't physically do it.
It's basically impossible.
So -- but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good.
And I'm confident that, let's say, within the next, I don't know, year or -- maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of 1,000 a week.
That's not in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality -- allowing for seasonality, where it's hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice.
But like, say spring, I think it's installing, but, which is the hard part.
We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit 1,000 a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
So that's not a problem.
It's building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry installers.
And internally, we want to have at least 1,000 Solar Roof install teams with -- and taking a week or perhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you 1,000 a week roof installations.
We see demand is good.
Production is good.
So it's really all about the install.
And then like I said, also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale -- allow us to scale far beyond 1,000 a week.
We're also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
So we do expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from China on the Solar Roof.
So we're confident, this will be a very significant product for the Company over time.
"
1225,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Well, as I said on Twitter, I'm personally extremely excited to build a kick-ass HVAC system that also has sort of hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
And these are all things we've achieved in our cars.
In fact, I don't know, a lot of people realized, but the Model S and X are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating room grade heavy filters built-in.
They're very big.
So -- but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
"
1226,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yeah.
It's not like Model 3 and Y are -- they're no slouches.
Model 3 and Y also -- they're way better than any other cars to the best of my knowledge.
They're not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal car.
And we're continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y.
These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
It's reducing particle count and it has an effect on allergies and all sorts of things.
So it's really -- air quality is incredibly important, you know in the non-COVID situation, extremely important.
So taking all those things that we've learned and applying it to how may HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be just very exciting.
And then if you've got -- if you're condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
"
1227,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"It could be a hell of a product.
So we just have to -- at Tesla, we have a tendency to apply a formula [Phonetic] we continue on the product front.
So we're going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world, and brilliant [Phonetic] Model Y, Autopilot and Solar Roof and...
"
1228,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Yeah, exactly.
Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.
We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for 2020.
"
1229,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Well, we haven't really thought about that yet.
It's not out of the question, but our brand is full.
Excuse me, sir, our brand is full.
That's not out of the question.
Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you've got to store the power, stationary storage.
And then you've got to have electric transportation.
So -- and we don't have, like, say, specific market share goals or anything like that.
It's just to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, we think that's a fundamental good for the world, and we want to do that as fast as possible.
But it's not, like you said, market share growth is a goal in and of itself.
It's just faster this happens, the better the world will do.
"
1230,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Yeah, absolutely.
As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
That is our goal.
And we think that, that's the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
And it's what results in long-term value creation and loyalty, the guest loyalty.
So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident that if we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
"
1231,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"I mean, really, it's -- yeah, exactly.
"
1232,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Yeah.
I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk.
We only have two car factories right now, one in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area, and the Bay Area produces the vast majority of our cars, all of S and X, and most of the 3 and all of the Y.
So, the extension of the shelter-in-place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional alliance, that's my opinion, and breaking people's freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country.
What the expletive [Phonetic]? Excuse me.
People -- the outrage -- systems outrage.
So -- but it will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to many companies.
And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not.
And all people's -- everything people have worked for their whole life is going to get -- is being destroyed in real time.
And we're going to have many suppliers -- or have many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the small ones, and it's causing a lot of strife to a lot of people.
Yes.
"
1233,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"I think, it's high time we invested in infrastructure in this country.
We have a lot of a crumbling highways and bridges.
And frankly, when I visit China, I see their infrastructure as being much better than ours.
It's great.
Europe has better infrastructure.
It's really quite sad that US infrastructure, especially sort of roads and highways is where it is today.
And our airports, in a lot of cases, are an embarrassment.
So -- and it's not just a question of money, it's a question of will.
Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it? So -- and yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation of the past.
If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or internal combustion engines? Obviously, not steam engines.
So, this is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people's rights, as what is happening right now.
I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should be -- if somebody wants to stay in their house, that's great.
They should be allowed to stay in their house, and they should not be compelled to leave.
But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
This is not democratic.
This is not freedom.
Give people back their goddamn freedom.
"
1234,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Zach?
"
1235,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"Yeah.
Agreed.
We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
So it's a test -- it's not make the product worse.
It's -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse.
We want to take costs out of the car, figure out how we can make it lighter and simpler.
And so, it's -- want the car to just incrementally improve, as well as incrementally lowering costs.
But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached say, 10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that and [Technical Issues]
"
1236,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"I think, well, we all need a Hiro.
And, obviously, he brings tremendous amount of experience investing at the highest levels in the world, and has done great work as -- at the Japan Pension Fund, which is the largest, I think, fund of any kind in the world.
And generally, the conversations over the years is just churning incredible insight into how the securities -- the global security markets work and what he thinks is right -- where there areas for reform.
It just -- it seems like he has a strong philosophical understanding about how to make the future better.
And he shares our view regarding the environment and just a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the Board and I think is generally recognized as such by many people.
"
1237,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"No.
I think this has got nothing to do with the Panasonic relationship.
I mean, I have a great relationship with Panasonic's CEO.
We meet regularly one on one and talk at all the time.
And so, that relationship is strong.
Just -- he'd bring more -- a broader and a global strategic view to the Board.
"
1238,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Well, it's pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is, we'll release more and more functionality.
Before we reach -- release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing.
First, we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.
So, we run any car changes through battery tests and simulation.
Then we have a global QA team, which I'm on, actually.
I'm one of -- on the global QA team.
And we test the releases in the real world, in the real world map, [Indecipherable] of real world in a simulation, which is -- which are very many, because the world is very complex and where -- and then we release it to a small group of private beta testers within the Company; then to a larger beta audience, including people outside the Company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; and then finally, a broad release.
And so, there are many stages that these things go through.
So, by the time something is being -- going to wide release into the US, it has gone through all of those stages.
And the software that's at the very early stage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.
So, just going to go through a very rigorous safety process.
So essentially, we need to figure out, get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns in intersections and things like busy malls, in a parking lot or office park or special events and sporting events, that kind of thing, when those eventually come back.
Those are extra hard cases.
But it's all tracking very well.
If you like, the Autopilot's engineering team is -- we just have an extremely talented group, and I'm deeply involved with the team.
So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, as now physical meeting is difficult.
So I have quite a deep understanding where we are, where we're headed.
And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we'll have the functionality that's really cool, also driving by the end of the year.
Now, after that functionality is released, there's still another step, which is to improve the reliability of it, once it is released, to kind of core self-driving with the human -- supervised by the driver.
And then we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver.
And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.
And then presumably the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for the autonomous cars that can drive with no human onboard.
Obviously, the regulatory approval process that's difficult for us to predict with accuracy, because it's out of our hands.
But for the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are.
"
1239,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Do you mean like, when can a car drive with no person on board or...
"
1240,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,22,"If described as a hope, I would say that, that's probably a fair description.
"
1241,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Yeah.
So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production cost in China.
And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China time.
So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
And we feel confident that that's, will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
"
1242,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,24,"So, I think it's quite likely, in my view -- again, I could be wrong.
As you see, because we are ahead in some areas, and we're behind in others, because -- when I give a guess, I give the guess that I think is the likely midpoint, not the point with lots of margin.
If this is normal distribution, I'd give you the 50th percentile, not the three segment optimistic or pessimistic.
So then that necessarily means, at least, half of my predictions will be wrong and half will be right.
Yeah.
I think -- or it might be right, but offset by a few weeks to a few months, in some cases a few years.
But I believe as everything I've ever said would come through -- did come through, it may come through late, but it did come through.
So, punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through in the end.
So -- and I think we could see robotaxis in operation with network fleet next year.
Not in all markets, but in some.
"
1243,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Yeah.
"
1244,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,26,
1245,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,27,"Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
That's -- one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
And we came to a conclusion that, that the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
And we've talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
So I think that there's clearly an uncertain future ahead.
It's a bit of a bumpy road.
But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.
Anything you guys want to add?
"
1246,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,28,"Yeah.
Touchless delivery.
"
1247,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,29,"Yeah.
Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.
That's it.
Effortless.
"
1248,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,30,"And they're doing it, yes.
In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.
Actually, my dentist is very -- but it's really like quite an arduous thing.
When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or something on Amazon and, except it's a car.
Yeah.
All right.
And five minutes is a, if you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in 90 seconds, so.
"
1249,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,31,"Yeah.
Actually, we were just -- we don't want to pre-empt Battery Day.
We want to -- leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell.
And I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla's history and we're just trying to figure out the right timing for that.
We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May.
Not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that's the right timing.
And depending upon what we're allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas.
"
1250,TSLA,2020,1,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,32,"Absolutely.
There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
And that's something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just toward the end of the year, as a subscription.
So that's just a lot of untapped potential there.
That's not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it is certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
"
1251,TSLA,2020,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,0,"Thanks so much, guys.
Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FSD and how you're seeing that play out? Obviously, it's a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are really in the way here, but we'd love to understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting the rollout of FSD throughout the balance of this year and into next year?
"
1252,TSLA,2020,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,1,"Thanks, guys.
And then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets.
Obviously, there's a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space.
Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you're migrating some of your exposure around some of your raw material costs?
"
1253,TSLA,2020,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,2,
1254,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,0,"Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone.
Welcome to Tesla's fourth-quarter 2020 Q&A webcast.
I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 p.m.
Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
[Operator instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
Elon? 
"
1255,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,1,"Thank you very much.
And I think our CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well.
"
1256,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,2,"Thank you.
And the second question from institutionals is, does Tesla plan or expect to license any of its software applications, FSD and auto bidder in particular, to third-party OEMs?
"
1257,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,3,"Thank you.
The next question is, key differences in product, customer preferences, FSD strategy between China and the rest of the world.
Do we need to do things differently to win the Chinese EV market?
"
1258,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,4,"Thank you.
And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company's long-term earnings power is tied to profit per unit of battery capacity? Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what you assume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?
"
1259,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,5,"Thank you very much.
The next question is about 4680 cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck development? What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in 2021?
"
1260,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,6,"Thank you very much.
And now we can start with questions in the queue.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you.
Our first question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Please go ahead.
"
1261,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,7,"Fantastic.
And let's take the last question please.
Operator
Thank you.
Our last question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.
Please go ahead.
"
1262,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,8,"All right.
Thank you very much.
And unfortunately, that's all the time we have today.
So thanks for all of your great questions, and we will speak to you again in about three months.
Thank you.
"
1263,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,9,
1264,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,10,"Thank you very much.
And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies.
The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in solar?
"
1265,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,11,"Thank you.
The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle? This would be a huge for loyalty and overall increased sales of vehicles who are offering more FSD sales on used vehicles.
"
1266,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,12,"Thank you.
"
1267,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,13,"Thank you very much.
And the third question is, can you give us a progress update on dry coating of the battery electrode? At the Battery Day, Elon said, 'I would not say this is completely in the bag as – yet as the yields were low.'
"
1268,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,14,"OK.
Thank you very much.
The next question is, why are you confident Tesla will achieve Level 5 autonomy in 2021? And why is Dojo not necessary to get there?
"
1269,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,15,"Thank you.
The next question is what is Tesla's current gigawatt-hour run rate of the 4680 cell production? How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?
"
1270,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,16,"Thank you very much.
And one more question is from retail investors.
What is Tesla doing to improve service experience? Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service.
Now it's impossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out.
Jerome?
"
1271,TSLA,2020,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,17,"Thank you very much.
And now let's go to institutional investor questions.
The question number one, what are the key milestones we need to achieve in order to evolve current FSD to a commercial Level 4, Level 5 ridesharing solution?
"
1272,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thank you.
So just to recap the year.
2020 was a defining year for us on many levels.
Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars.
I'd just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
So really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020.
So my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures.
We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
Regarding capacity expansion.
While we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
We started producing the model out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y.
This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
We're also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X pad -- are in production now and will be delivered in February.
So we've been able to bring forward the fab, Model S and X.
And Model S will be delivered in February and Model X a little later.
The Model S pad, and we're actually in production now, and we'll be delivering next month.
So this is a tri motor Model S with a completely new interior.
There are actually a lot of great things about this.
I'll do another call about the Model S later.
But it's really a tremendous improvement over the prior version.
And the Model S will be the first -- the smallest pad will be the first production car ever that is able to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under two seconds.
So no production car ever has been able to get below two seconds zero to 60.
This is a luxury stand that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than two seconds, and will have the ability to seat up to seven people with the third row seats.
So this is pretty nice.
This is faster to be clear than any car.
It's not like there was a different type of car, like a two-door sports car that was able to do be -- is the fastest accelerating car ever made for -- that is allowed to go on roads in history.
And like I say, we'll start delivering it in a matter of weeks.
And obviously gets into the details what the Model S changes maybe later this week or next.
But it's really better in many ways.
We will be actually raising the price of Model S for these new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more.
So hopefully, people aren't too upset if they bought the old model last month, but this one $10,000 more.
So yes, we think it's probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today.
So then with regard to full self-driving, we've made massive progress on Full Self-Driving.
I recommend watching the videos of our public beta.
So we've got, I think, almost 1,000 people in the beta at this point.
And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, just -- it's really improving rapidly.
It's not very common for -- I drive the latest [Inaudible].
It's very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place that I've never been to.
So these are not preplanned routes.
The car has never been there before.
And it's now actually more -- it's more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on a complex drive.
So -- and this is -- basically I'm highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year.
This is a very big deal.
And thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is? And I think there is a way, just with back of the on road map to potentially justify it, where if Tesla's ships, let's say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become full self-driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week if they're capable of serving as robotaxi.
So that's like roughly a five times increase in utility.
But let's -- even if you say like, OK, let's just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not five times as useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost entirely gross margin.
So it would mean, it would be like if you made $50 million -- $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having $50 million of incremental profit basically from that because it's just software.
So -- and the pace you get 20 PE on that, it's like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode.
So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD.
And I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach.
So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of profitability, we believe this is just the beginning.
We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting.
And you don't know what to expect in a given year.
Obviously, last year, we did not hear many things, we do not expect.
But assume that '21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint.
I think it's going to be a great year for Tesla.
We've got a ton of -- many great new products coming out We've got factories that are advanced factories out of [Inaudible] production.
It will also make it easier how you're having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint.
Texas can help supply the eastern half of the U.S.
and Berlin can help supply Europe.
And there's just pure cars on both, much less capital tied up with big cars that are at or -- have been transported to customers.
And I think the fundamental efficiency of the company will be much better with the factories or at least having factories on -- on each continent and having two factories in the U.S.
So I'm super excited about the future.
And yes, we look forward to making it happen.
Thank you.
"
1273,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter over quarter last year.
And we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4.
So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building.
We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
But now we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
"
1274,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"I think we're very open to licensing our software to third parties.
And we've had some preliminary discussions about licensing autopilot to other OEMs.
So this is something we're more than happy to do.
And -- but I think, obviously, like we need to probably do a little bit more work to prove that Tesla Autopilot is capable of full self-driving, which is, I think, will become obvious later this year.
And then we're more than happy to license that to other car companies.
We're definitely not trying to keep it to be a Tesla exclusive situation.
And I think the probably same goes for Autobidder.
We haven't thought as much about Autobidder, but the Tesla philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens.
We're going to allow other companies to use our supercharge networks.
And yes, using our autonomy software and Autobidder be fine too.
"
1275,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Well, we currently are winning that -- we are currently the leader in the Chinese EV market.
So I think we're mostly doing something right if we're the best-selling electric car in China.
That said, very few of our customers in China, I think maybe as low as 1% or 2%, actually have selected the FSD option.
This is much lower than rest of world.
So we definitely need to make it work well in China.
I think some of it works well in China, then we will have a Grade 4 FSD.
I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
Their attention to detail is incredible.
So they -- I'm confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it's working on time.
And we hopefully that is later this year.
"
1276,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yeah.
It is.
So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours? And you can't grow faster than that.
Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
It is to supplement our suppliers.
And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
"
1277,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"All right.
So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
So we're no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
We've got the designs fixed.
We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
We're actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you've got – obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to a lot of load.
So we'll be using an 8,000 ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y.
So 6,000 tons was the biggest cast in the world.
8,000 tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
And I think it's going to be incredible vehicle.
If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries toward the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.
"
1278,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"OK.
Zach, do you want to – I don't know, Zach and Jerome?
"
1279,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"No, it does not.
Although, we are talking with them about making the 4680 form factor, but they -- it is not required.
For example, the new S currently uses the 18650 form factor.
So they're just a more advanced cell, and we think we'll continue to use that form factor for at least a few years.But we will, over time, be retiring the form factors and try to move to a consistent form factor.
But it is not a requirement that we place on our suppliers, because they would -- it would just result in fewer cells.
So it's better for us to deal with the complexity of different cell form factors than insist on a single form factor for our suppliers today.
Like I said, over time, it will make sense to have a consistent form factor.
"
1280,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"That is one of the things that limits focus or limits the growth rate.
It doesn't limit the ultimate size, but it limits the growth rate, which is what's the rate of which we can onboard great people and get them trained in the right areas.
You usually can't like instantaneously -- if you've got a factory that has 20,000 employees, you can't just hire 20,000 people instantly.
They've got -- they're usually doing something else.
So they've got to transition from whatever they were doing or move from some other part of the country.
And so there's a certain amount of time required for that.I mean, that said, we do think that we can maintain a growth rate in excess of 50% per year for many years to come.
And at least, I'd like to -- yes, at least, look forward to many -- for many years to come.
I think this year, we may track to a fair bit about 50%, but we don't want to commit to that, but at least that's what it would appear, and the same again next year.
It appears to be meaningfully above 50%.

Thank you.
Our next question will come from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
"
1281,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"I think Tesla is definitely going to make an electric van at some point.
The thing to bear in mind is that there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output.
It's like -- if one is not involved in manufacturing, it's really hard to appreciate just how hard this to scale production is.
It's the hardest thing in the world.
Prototypes are easy.
Scaling production is very hard.
So a big part of the reason -- the main reason we have not accelerated new products is -- like, for example, Tesla Semi is that we simply don't happen our cells group.
We -- this -- if we were to make the Semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the Semi, but we would not have enough to cells built for it right now.
We will have cells group in ourselves for Semi when we were producing the 4680 volume.
But for example, Semi would use typically five times the number of cells that car would use, but it would not sell for five times what a car would sell for.
So it kind of doesn't make -- it would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.
The same would go for that.
"
1282,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Yes, to be clear, we are still not -- the software still does not fully use the capabilities of the FSD in 1 computer.
It is really just incredibly powerful computer and I am personally certain that you can create full self-driving with safe Level 5 presence just using the Full Self-Driving Version 1 computer.
The Version 2, we expect to be about three times as powerful.
And this needs to be paired with higher resolution cameras.
And so it's quite a -- it requires a bunch of things to change simultaneously.
But we have not been rushing the Version 2 of the chip.
It's coming along well, and it's in good shape.But since we can achieve FSD, Full Self-Driving, with the current system, it would actually be a distraction right now if we were to introduce the Full Self-Driving, the Tesla FSD chip 2 because it would set us back quite a bit on software.
And software is the critical path to Full Self-Driving.
So I wouldn't worry too much about that.
That's not a -- that's an improvement but not a game changer.
That has to be changed.
Getting the software to work and getting all the neural nets to be video, that's the game changer.

Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
"
1283,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"I think we feel very confident about achieving those targets, let's say, over a three-year time frame.
I don't know it grew -- it's not like year one.
So three, maybe four years, give ourselves a little room.
But for three or four years, I'd say.
"
1284,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Yes.
And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof.
And we're confident we'll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retrofit or but lower class before the end of the year.So it's really – I think we've got a good strategy.
As Zach mentioned, we're focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we're making great progress in that regard.
And I think we'll have something that's really dialed in this year.

1285,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Yeah.

Our next question will come from Ben Kallo with Baird.
Please go ahead.
"
1286,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Sure.
Well, I expect to be CEO of Tesla for several years.
So I think there's still a lot that I'm super excited about doing.
And I think it would be hard to leave.
I love these great projects halfway or part like hallway done.
So I do expect to be running the company for several years into the future.
Now obviously, nobody is or should be CEO forever.
So I don't expect to be -- like the sheer amount of work required to be CEO of Tesla is insane.
And I do -- I think I do probably more -- I definitely do more technical work than is typical for a CEO.
So it would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep seven days a week, pretty intense.
So -- but I think the mission isn't over yet, and we still got a long way ago before we can really make a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy.
I mean, the goal Tesla, from beginning, has been to accelerate sustainable energy.
And -- but if you say like what percentage of cars on the road are electric today, it's still very, very tiny, like an order of 1%, or less than 1% of the total fleet worldwide.
So that's the full have long way to go for on the order of 1% of the fleet is electric.
There's also a tremendous way to go on solar power, although it's exciting to see the advent of very cost-competitive wind and solar and geothermal.
And of course, we need a large volume of stationary battery packs.
I mean basically, maybe the three legs of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, led by solar, wind, geothermal and hydro and a few others.
And I'm actually not against nuclear fission.
I actually think nuclear fission is – with a well-designed reactor in a situation that is not subject to bad weather or seriously bad weather is actually is a good thing to do.
So – and then the second thing you need is stationary storage need batteries because most renewable energy is intermittent.
It doesn't – the wind doesn't blow all the time.
The sun doesn't shine all the time.
So you need a lot of batteries.
And it needs to be very long-lasting and high cycle life.
And then you need electric transport.
If you have those three things, we've got a very bright future with respect to energy and the environment.
So a long way to go on that.
And so I'm still very much fired up to work on that.
"
1287,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"I think that's quite likely, yes.
Yes, I can't imagine – I'm not sure who would be number two, but yes, it seems highly likely, yes.
"
1288,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Yes.
That's true.
Yes.
As it is, we need to modify the parameters, software parameters change for Autopilot or Self-Driving because it needs now to Model 3, Model Y, Model X or Model S.
And so this is – we just need to inform the vehicle, inform the Full Self-Driving brain that it is now in a Semi Truck.
"
1289,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"No.
I think there will be – you have a different control functions because there are turns that you could do in a regular car that you cannot do in a Semi, like you do want to try to parallel park this thing on the street in a city.
It needs to know its limitations being a giant truck.
"
1290,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Yes.
I mean, honestly, I've had this question a million times for just for regular vehicles, even back in the early Roadster days, even before we had the Roadster out.
People were saying that somehow hydrogen is going to be a better means of energy storage in a car than batteries.
And it was like this is just really not the case.
Hydrogen is a very – it's number one in the periodic table.
It's got very low density.
It's got low density as a liquid, like styrofoam-level density as a liquid.
And then it's only a liquid very close to absolute zero.
So you have to have a – it's really not realistic to keep it as liquid.
You want to have it as a high-pressure gas that has even lower density.
So you need a gigantic fuel tank volumetrically, and it's got to be very high pressure.
It's a big pain yes, basically.
If somebody is going to say, use an ultimate chemical energy storage mechanism to hydrogen, I'd say just use propane or something like that, or methane -- those will be way better than hydrogen.
And then having it be a fuel cell just adds even further complications to the situation.
It's just crazy basically.
And we're extremely confident that we could a long-range trucking with batteries.
The math works out.
You don't -- if you could just like take, say, watt-hours per kilogram of currently available cells, and say, OK, how much -- what weight would you need to go, let's say, 500 miles? And to what degree does that affect your payload? And it's like, OK, do this.
If you do it right, you basically have no effect on your payload or almost nothing, and you can have a long-range truck.
I mean, Jerome, do you want to add to that?
"
1291,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"But basically, we do not see any issues with creating a compelling long-range truck with batteries.
The problem is cell supply; cell supply is the only thing.

1295,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Unfortunately, we're not considering that at this time.
We do actually offer an increased – higher price than for a car with FSD than one without FSD.
And I do think that the market currently undervalues – or the consumer market.
And arguably the stock market sales probably undervalue the just how good FSD is going to be.
But we're not currently planning on offering – online to get transferred.
"
1296,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,24,"We will be offering subscription pretty soon in the next month or two.
So that should address a lot of people's concerns for being able to get it.
"
1297,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Andrew?
"
1298,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,26,"I guess, I'm confident based on my understanding of the technical roadmap and the progress that we're making between each beta iteration.
Yes.
As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car to completely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections.
It's now about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respect to an accident.
Basically, we need to get it to better than human bio factor at least 100% or 200%.
And the business happening rapidly because we've got so much training data with all the cars in the field.
And the software is improving dramatically.
The -- we also write the software for labeling.
And I'll say it's quite challenging.
We're moving everything toward video labeling.
So all video labeling for video inference and so there are still a few of new met that need to be upgraded to video training inference.
And really, as we transition to each net to video, the performances become exceptional.
So this is like a hot thing.
The video -- the labeling software that we work for, video labeling, making that better has a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling.
And then, of course, the Holy Grail is auto labeling.
So we're -- we put a lot of work into having the labeling tool to be more efficient when we used, as well as enabling auto labeling where we can.Dojo is a training supercomputer.
We believe it will be -- we think it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude.
So it is a whole thing in and of itself.
And this is offer potentially as a service.
So some of the others need neural net training, we're not trying to keep it to ourselves.
So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself.
And then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from 100% to 200% better than average human to 2,000% better than average human.
So that will be very helpful in that regard.
"
1299,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,27,"I think we kind of talked about that true.
I mean essentially, what we're saying is that the number to think about or focus on is like we've got a 100 gigawatt-hour total Tesla cells produced in 2022.
It's not that important to look at the run up to that because -- but these things tend to improve exponentially.
But we are installing capacity for -- in 2022 for 200 gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022.
"
1300,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,28,"Yes.
And we don't see any showstoppers.
"
1301,TSLA,2020,4,elon-musk,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,29,"Yes.
So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is, we need to transition over the neural nets in the car to video.
And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be to — the whole stack has to be changed to video.
That means gathering video clips than using – and this is actually surround video.
So you've got eight cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates.
So you've got eight frame surround video – eight camera surround video.
And then you've got to label basically everything in that video snippet and then train against that and have those neural nets operate the car.
So – and this is coming from the past where we would label, the neural nets would be a single camera, single frame.
So no video and not combining the cameras.
And then we went from single frame, one frame at a time, one camera at a time, neural nets to surround camera -- neural nets would look at all -- all eight cameras but only one frame at a time, and now to where we include the time dimension, and that's video.
So I really do see this as a question of getting work done.
We're getting it done.
And you can see the results in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are at least -- we're also going to be expanding the FSD beta itself to include more and more people.
So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path toward a vehicle that will drive 100% safer than a person.
Yes.
I really don't see any obstacles here.

Good evening.
Thank you.
Two questions, one on 2021 and just one on capital.
First, on 2021.
Any expectations for what we should see on regulatory credit sales? And then the second question is on capital.
Obviously, you raised a lot of capital in 2020.
What should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering some of the maturities? And can you just give us a sense of what the elevated liquidity does and doesn't buy? Meaning, to what extent does elevated capital enable you to accelerate plans on building capacity or expanding vertical integration, accelerating timing on full self-drive features? So those are the questions.
Thank you.

Thank you, Elon.
Congrats to the whole team.
So we're trying to put together all the breadcrumbs.
If I remember correctly, going back 10 years, you talked about when you have a mass market car on the road, that you'd step down as CEO and be a Chief Architect.
And then we have -- you go into Hawaii, subsea lair and the x.com, and I'm trying to put it all together.
There's a lot of questions there.

I was wondering, you mentioned how you'd like to increase your purchases of cells from suppliers.
Does this require them to also have the capability to build structural 4680 cells of the sort that you're putting in these newer iterations of vehicles?
"
1313,TSLA,2020,4,alex-potter,piper-sandler,True,1,"OK.
It makes sense.
And then one additional, maybe qualitative question on capacity expansion.
You've mentioned in the past, I mean, access to dollars is one thing, but access to human beings that are sufficiently qualified is another.
Have you run up against any issues on that front that would potentially limit your growth in any way? Thanks.

1314,TSLA,2020,4,alex-potter,piper-sandler,True,2,
1315,TSLA,2020,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yes.
Thanks, Martin.
As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges.
On cash, we continue to generate strong free cash flows, reaching a record $1.9 billion in Q4 alongside growth and investment for future programs.
Additionally, we've been able to reduce our use of debt and various working capital lines, including settling $2 billion of convertible debt in Q4, which will continue into Q1.
For net income, we achieved our first calendar year and six sequential quarters of profitability.
In addition, auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved from 2019 to 2020 despite reductions in ASP and inefficiencies from new product launches and transitions.
On Q4 specifically, this was a noisy quarter so let's unpack a few things.
Stock-based comp increased, part of which is driven by the rise of the stock price over the course of our 2020 employee performance grant process and a portion of which is unique to Q4 only.
The impact of SBC increases is seen across both COGS as well as operating expenses.
Automotive gross margin in Q4 was primarily impacted by two things: First, we invested in improving our products built in Fremont, including converting over to the new Model S and Model X, launching the single-piece castings on Model Y and introducing heat pump on Model 3.
Second, logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies.
Adjusting for items such as these as we do in our internal management views, we saw an improvement in auto gross margin.
Our services and other P&L was impacted by many of the same factors just mentioned, including onboarding costs associated with new service capacity.
However, what's most important here is that we've accelerated the growth in service capacity and will continue to drive capacity expansion as fast as possible.
On energy gross margin, we saw an impact from Solar Roof-related ramp costs and typical seasonality in the lease PPA business.
Opex as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce despite impacts from items mentioned as well as increased investment in development of future products.
Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $100 million of interest expense for the quarter.
All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain industry-leading.
As we look forward, 2021 may be our most meaningful step forward yet as we see the benefits of long-standing investments in capacity and technology.
The range of possible outcomes this year is wide, given the magnitude of launches.
There's a few things we should keep in mind.
We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of 50%, of which we may materially exceed this in 2021.
As we increase production rates, volumes will skew toward the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year's story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.
Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
Additionally, we're working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including open as a percentage of revenue.
Global demand continues to outpace production, and we're moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long term.
I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.
"
1316,TSLA,2020,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing.
And so that's something that we've accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be and I think I've mentioned this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become the leader in the space.
"
1317,TSLA,2020,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yes.
Yes.
Agreed, Elon.
And as you've said before, with the S curve of production, you can be off a little bit on the initial part of the S curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite a bit, one month to the next.
So yes, I mean we are progressing up that S curve as fast as we possibly can.
"
1318,TSLA,2020,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes.
"
1319,TSLA,2020,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"The – what we're seeing right now in the U.S., for example, is pretty dynamic space, but it's overall not particularly limiting on a rule basis, but what we're going to expect is to have to work with regulators to demonstrate really, really high reliability, as Elon said before.The rest of the world is fairly dynamic.
In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally not reaching past Level 3 right now with some impetus to start working on new working groups to reach past that.
And China showed an interest in working on Level 4 or even Level 5 later this year.
So we expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space.
We have leadership in the U.S.
looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups.
"
1320,TSLA,2020,4,zach-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Sure.
On the regulatory and credit sales side, this isn't always an area that's extremely difficult for us to forecast.
2020 regulatory credit sales ended up being higher than our expectations.
And it's difficult to give guidance on that.
I mean what I said before is that in the long-term, regulatory credit sales will not be a material part of the business, and we don't plan the business around that.
It's possible that for a handful of additional quarters, it remains strong.
It's also possible that it's not.
Most of our regulatory credit revenue from Q4 was not lined up prior to the beginning of the quarter.
And these were discrete deals that were struck over the course of the quarter.
So I wish I could give you more on this, Dan, but it's a space that's extraordinarily difficult for us to forecast.
On the second side, with respect to capital, a couple of things that we're thinking through there.
So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, debt reduction is an important thing that we're focused on now.
Early conversions, these are things we don't have a choice on.
We did around $2 billion of that in Q4.
We currently have $1.4 billion that we expect to go out in Q1 as a result of early conversions or conversions on convertible debt.
That number may increase and so debt reduction is important.
That's helpful on interest expense as well.
We are also using the money with respect to our investments in future capacity.
And so what we're able to do now that we haven't had the opportunity to do in the past is, as we're building capacity, particularly in Austin and Berlin, we can build that capacity with the expectation of what the end state of capacity will be pulling forward some of those investments, rather than incrementally adding capacity as we go along.
And so this is an important part in terms of capital efficiency that we haven't had the luxury to do in the past.
And it's great to be able to have the liquidity to focus on that.
And then more broadly, as Jerome was touching on, service expansion is really important to the future strategy of the company.
So as you saw in our Q4 numbers, the expansion of service centers and mobile service from Q3 to Q4 increased quite a bit and was also quite a bit higher than the first part of the year.
And so we're able now to make investments there and also in the supercharging network to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term, but is what the right long-term thing is for our customers and the company.

We haven't really heard of anything since.
But in the meantime, we've seen a lot of activity in electric van and last-mile space from a number of established players of start-ups.

My first question is about your in-house cell manufacturing efforts.
So in addition to building up capacity, some of the goals you highlighted was to cut the pricing or the cost by about 50%, boost the range by about 50% over a number of years.
So wanted to know if your initial efforts are trending in that direction? What is, sort, of like the timeline to achieve these goals? And maybe related to this, how are you thinking about the time line for the cheaper Tesla, the entry model, eventually?

Well, as far as best service, no service.
So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America.
We're trying to push that to 50% this year.
In 50% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
So we're trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in North America.
For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days.
And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening.
In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year.
So that's what we're doing to improve service.
In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
And we are trying to move away from the phone.
As the app is much better than the phone.
It can spot directly alerts, directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.
And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team.
You can have pictures in there.
You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card and doing all that stuff.
You get updates on the service.
And there is even more features that are going to come in the coming months on the app.
And I think everybody will be happy, including the ability to spot where your service technician is and how far it is to coming from your car and what's going on there.
So we are investing everything on the app.
I think just like most other companies as well, and that's the way of the

Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in particular, both between Asia and North America.
But we're also looking forward to pricing, and we're watching this very closely for all the components.
We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only you're going to have enough quantity to support the growth, 50% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate sharing of the risk.

Sure.
It's true.
The in-house cell manufacturing system we revealed at Battery Day contains new processes and equipment.
So we did expect some unknown unknowns and technical challenges to arise through the production ramp.
The Kato team, however, has been able to solve each manufacturing problem presented to date, and continues to improve yield and rate week-over-week and month-over-month as we move up the production S-Curve.
At the same time, the cell engineering teams refined designs, and deepened understanding has reinforced our confidence in the drive process and 4680 design, meeting our performance and cost targets.
And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato.
The production staff is nearly all hired.
Our material supply chain is established and the team is on track for full production ramp this year.
Meanwhile, we've developed enough engineering confidence with our 4680 design and the production process and equipment to kick off manufacturing equipment and facility construction to support our 100 gigawatt hour 2022 goal

I've got two.
The first one for me is try to understand your business model for stationary storage, have your thoughts on it.
I mean there are two broad directions for me.
One is selling hardware, which is a bit of a cost-plus business.
And I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity where Tesla could actually share into the savings that utilities, in particular, could be able to achieve in like grid stabilization.
The information I was able to get on your business in Australia a few years ago suggest that given the savings that are achieved, your hardware could have been sold at a higher price.

Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3? And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
Was this just purely a function of higher volume? Or was there also FSD revenues? Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.

And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.
And I think your strategy generally has been you cut costs and that allows you to cut price, and you can generate the extra volume.
And I think that's what we're seeing in China and the use of LFP.
That's a good example.
So once you ramp in Berlin, what's the reasonable expectation of what pricing might look like in Europe? And how flexible are you going to be on pricing to generate incremental reg credit, so margins out of the gate that are a little low, but that are then used for the reg credits that help to offset that?

1371,TSLA,2020,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"OK.
And now I'm trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like.
So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it's going to be almost 850,000 units on an annualized basis.
And you're going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin.
You say today you would open Austin as well.
So you're probably going to end the year above one million units.
And so am I right thinking next year we should expect to deliver like somewhere like between 840,000 and one million cars during the year?

1372,TSLA,2020,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"Thank you.

1374,TSLA,2020,3,carl-peterson,director-of-engineering,False,0,"Yes.
I'm Carl Peterson.
I'm on the Solar Roof engineering and installation.
The biggest constraint right now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and experienced.
We've made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we're continuing to hire.
The next opportunity is improving the material flow on the job site.
We've talked about this a lot in the factory as well that setting up the right packaging, kitting so that every installer on the roof has the parts they need at their fingertips.
Also, we've had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they're ramping up installations for Solar Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth.

Thanks for taking my question.
Elon, what do you think the biggest structural issue is with the, let's call it, old school OEMs, or one or two of the structural issues, for them not getting their act together and catching up with you? And then you mentioned what you — we want the world to look like ahead of us.
What do you envision that? Is it like just Tesla or Tesla and Rivian or what?

First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and solar.
Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business, and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
We have more demand than supply through 2021, and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand across the globe through 2023 and beyond.
Our order book is rapidly filling up through 2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.
Large-scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations across the globe.
This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.
This is true for stand-alone storage as well.
Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed.
For Powerwall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation.
We have a very large backlog of Powerwall orders, and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders.
We're just now capturing the full power of customer-sited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are providing services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power.
This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after tax incentives, which is the lowest in the industry.
We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales and marketing.
As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.
We're using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the technology backbone of the company.
Solar Roof is especially exciting as we've gained significant experience over the last year in the installation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
We've recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
Please note, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation.
Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience and will enable the business to grow exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
"
1380,TSLA,2020,3,rj-johnson,global-head-of-commercial-energy,False,1,"Yes.
I mean we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregation that is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customer and reduces the prices for the grid operator.
So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe.
And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.
So Megapack on one end and then Powerwall on the other side.
Those two working together in tandem and the software layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware platform and software together.
"
1381,TSLA,2020,3,rj-johnson,global-head-of-commercial-energy,False,2,
1382,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Martin.
All right.
So Q3 was our best quarter in history.
We achieved record production and deliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cash flow of $1.4 billion.
This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team.
I could not be more proud to work with such a great group of people.
Just really k****** performance across — throughout the world.
Of course, we had our Battery Day.
So we hosted — showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think most significantly at the manufacturing technology level.
There's only — a comment I made in the past is that I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarily manufacturing.
This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite confident this will be what happens.
All right.
So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries.
We wanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch.
First principles thinking, just look at it from fundamental physics and say what — rather than compare to other products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, if you — what's the limit of physics? What's the platonic idea of a perfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration.
And I think we've got a pretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time.
And we went through all of the interesting solutions for every important part of battery design and production.
And we'll continue to iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology.
The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capital expenditures required are one-third or less of what they are today.
And we expect Giga Berlin will see our first battery cell production line at scale.
Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release.
The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team.
I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team.
And there's a lot of really talented people in that team who've worked incredibly hard to make the — to get the beta release out.
So I'd just really like to thank them for their hard work.
And it's just a very smart group of people.
So I think we're starting very slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place.
And so we're — we put it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes and then probably release it to more people this weekend or early next week.
And then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a wide release by the end of this year.
And of course, as the system collects more data and — it becomes more robust.
So it's sort of like how does Google as a search engine get better.
It's because everyone is programming it by asking questions all the time and clicking on particular links.
So it's got this great feedback loop, and that makes it an extremely effective search engine.
It's the same thing for autonomy.
Having on the order of one million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner case situations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is really valuable.
It's not like the obvious stuff, obvious stuff you can do in simulation.
But weird corner cases, only a reality can give you that.
So that's — but we're able to say, OK, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner cases.
And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.
There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection.
So the car — the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person.
That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.
Then in terms of capacity build out, we're making progress on three major factories.
We're continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well.
The Tesla China team is just, I mean, incredibly good.
Super smart, work hard.
It's like I'm always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes.
It's beyond all reasonable expectations.
And then we're under construction in Berlin and Texas — and Austin.
So we're also making good progress there.
Yes.
Good.
It's overall going well.
I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year.
But because of the exponential nature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start off very slow at first and then become very — upward, will become very large.
Just in general, manufacturing follows the S-curve.
And I think sometimes, people, if they haven't spent a lot of time manufacturing, kind of think that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on and it's at capacity.
But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity.
And that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology.
So yes, I'd say 12 to 24 months even.
So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time.
Then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an S-curve.
It goes exponential to linear to logarithmic.
And it's actually an incredibly hard thing just bringing a production plant up to volume technology.
If — because you can actually think of it like you've got, through first-order approximation, 10,000 unique parts or processes, all of which operate on an S-curve and — with a bunch of uncertainty, and you can just slide 10,000 S-curves on an X-axis, and that's what bringing up a large automotive plant is like.
And which one is the laggard, which one is the leader, it's very difficult to tell, and it's constantly changing.
So it's really one of the most difficult challenges I've ever seen.
So let's see.
In conclusion, thank you.
What we've achieved would not be possible without the incredible hard work of tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people at our suppliers as well.
I'd like to thank our suppliers.
We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on cost control and improving quality.
And ultimately, the best company will be that which makes great products at an affordable price, and that's our goal.
I think I've never felt more optimistic about the future of Tesla than I do today.
I'd also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thick and thin.
This is — I think there's a lot more good stuff to come.
All right.
With that, we can move to questions.
"
1383,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,1,"OK.
Sure.
"
1384,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Yes.
We're ramping up stationary storage a lot.
So I mean, it's approximately doubling.
We expect it's approximately double next year.
So that's pretty good.
And hopefully, we can accelerate that in years to come.
"
1385,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Yes, yes, yes.
I mean if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we'll need to start turning Jupiter into cells.
"
1386,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yes.
So I think it's — we're trying to derisk 2021 so that there's almost no dependency on our internal cell production.
It's very, very small.
The internal cell production will help us ramp in '22, but we're not dependent on it for '21.
"
1387,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yes.
And our pilot line is pretty big as pilot lines go.
It's — it will be in the top 10 cell factories on Earth, I believe.
"
1388,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Subscale one, yes, so...
"
1389,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Yes.
I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through an exponential is that if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift one — plus/minus one year, it has a huge effect on the number.
So — and it sounds like, wow, you either massively exceeded or massively undershot.
But it's — actually, what's going on is a giant S-curve.
So a whole bunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve.
So that's why it's difficult to predict the middle.
And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles.
But it does seem like a good goal to have because that would mean that we're replacing 1% of the global fleet per year.
And it's difficult to say that we're — are we really changing the world if we're not switching out 1% of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean I'm not sure that we can make that argument unless we change at least 1% of the vehicles per year.
So that's where the two — the 20 million vehicle per year comes from.
It's like 1% of two billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently.
The global fleet is growing.
So probably will be a bit bigger in the future.
So it's hard to say.
It's like map an S-curve to a $20 million — a 20 million vehicle target in 2030, and we will slide it around and see what that number looks like.
That will give you about as much insight as we have.
"
1390,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yes.
I mean answering the first part, the cell production system is fairly agnostic on anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator, that kind of thing.
We could change, and we will change, and upgrade all aspects of the cell.
So — and we could, for example, make ion phosphate or nickel manganese or something like that.
It's quite adaptable.
So I wouldn't say just too much more about it.
The lithium, like a pure lithium anode is maybe not — it's not as great as it may sound.
Yes.
Volumetrically, you're not gaining all that much because if you got nothing on the — let's say on the anode side, you got — and you just play out lithium, it's got to go somewhere, so you got to have room for it.
"
1391,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Yes.
Exactly.
But if it turned out that a pure lithium anode is the right move, that would simply — that would be no problem.
"
1392,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Sorry.
Are you talking about the — for cell manufacturing or selling or...
"
1393,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,11,"OK.
Well, I mean, Tesla is absolutely vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company.
We have a massive amount of internal manufacturing technology that we built ourselves.
We literally make the machine.
In fact, we design it — so like, OK, what are the things we want to make, design a machine that will make that thing, then we make the machine.
This is what — this makes it quite difficult to copy Tesla, which we're not actually all that opposed to people copying us, but it's quite difficult because you can't do catalog engineering.
You can't just I'll pick up the supplier catalog, I'll get one of those machines, one of that machine, bingo, I'm now Tesla.
You have to — there is no catalog.
What catalog — so we made the machine that made the machine that made the machine.
It gets — no, no, we don't want to get carried away here.
But — and quite frankly, we would like to outsource less.
That would be great.
Because then if we could outsource — if we take something that we're doing and outsource it, then we could take those people, and they — we're going to have them do something else.
But yes, it's like we're just making a crazy amount of machinery internally.
Tesla is not well understood.
If you just walk around the factory, you'd just get a sense for it.
And — yes.
I don't know if this is like a smart move.
But I just know like, hey, if we're trying to make progress and nobody's got the machines that we need, we've got to make it, so we do.
"
1394,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Yes.
Drew, do you want to take that?
"
1395,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Yes.
I mean something like insurance is a good example of a product that's basically made by our internal applications team.
So we made the insurance product and connect it to the car, look at the data, calculate the risk.
This is all internally — basically internal software application.
It's pretty low capital but has very high return.
I don't know.
We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it.
That's our current plan.
And so it's quite hard to spend money without wasting it, or just — we're like really just trying to not waste too much of it, frankly.
We will certainly waste some of it, but trying to waste, not to waste too much of it, this is very difficult.
But otherwise, we just try to spend money as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yields more value than it costs.
"
1396,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,14,"I mean totally free, well, I think probably — I think even if it was free, we wouldn't put it on.
"
1397,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Well, I don't know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money in it.
I mean I think you obviously need to focus — if you care about autonomy, you need to focus on vision because the entire road system is based on passive optical.
So you have to solve passive optical for — to have a self-driving system that is a generalized solution.
And once you solve passive optical, you've solved self-driving, so why bother with anything else?
"
1398,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Sure.
I was in the studio actually on — last Friday with Franz and the team just going over just sort of some improvements to the Cybertruck.
Generally, at Tesla, we really aim to make the car that is delivered better than the car that is unveiled.
Because it always drive me crazy, car companies would unveil these awesome looking cars, like, great, you can't wait until they make that.
And then the car they actual make is like much worse, and — but it's just — it's like really disappointing? So man, we always want to make the car that we deliver be better than the car we unveil.
And that's the goal with the Cybertruck.
So there's like a lot of small improvements compared to what was unveiled.
I think it's going to be better than what we showed.
And yes, it's cool.
Like it's going to be made in Austin.
So it's kind of dependent on completing that factory.
And there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton.
This is — it's never been done before, so there'll probably be some challenges along the way.
And obviously, something that's extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form.
So there's manufacturing challenges there.
That's why it's so cleaner.
Although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint.
Yes.
If all goes well, we'll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries toward the end of next year, yes.
So it's difficult to predict.
I would say there's probably a lot of deliveries in '22 and some deliveries toward the end of next year if things go well.
"
1399,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,17,"Yes.
Go ahead, Zach.
"
1400,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,18,"I mean it's in that vicinity.
Yes.
You're not far off.
"
1401,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,19,"Well, actually, Jerome, do you want to answer that?
"
1402,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Sorry.
Go ahead.
"
1403,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Yes.
Just a note on the sort of Semi.
The Semi does consume a lot of cells.
So it's, call it, four to six times more than a passenger vehicle.
Vehicle, five, five-x-ish.
So if we are cell-constrained, it is — it kind of — it's difficult to ramp up the Semi because there's no cells.
So we need to solve the cell constraint before ramping Semi to significant volume.
That's the only real constraint on Semi's progress.
And just we found over and over again, we just kept running into cell production limitations.
And then we're just taking things out of one pocket and putting them in another.
So we just need more cells so that we can do more stationary storage, more vehicles, more vehicle lines.
Matter of fact, we need more cells.
"
1404,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,22,"I think it's very material for sure.
I mean really long term, all transport will go autonomous.
Yes.
Horses are already autonomous.
But all transport will go autonomous, yes, so including Semi.
So it will be pretty significant.
"
1405,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Yes.
I think we'll give it some thought.
"
1406,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Yes.
It's just bigger and more motors.
"
1407,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Well, I do think there will be other car companies.
I don't think we're going to be the only one.
So I mean, the things that — like what other car companies do even in the auto segment is quite a small subset of what Tesla is.
So Tesla, we design and build.
We're very vertically integrated.
So we're designing and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to the traditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering.
So it's not very adventurous, and it basically ends up like older products end up looking the same because they're going to the same suppliers.
So I mean to the degree that you inherit legacy components, you inherit the legacy limitations and cost structure.
And so you kind of need to make new ingredients, new parts, and then you need — then there's no machine to make those parts.
So you have to make the machine that makes the part.
So Tesla is like — we're probably — I mean we might be, in order of magnitude, more vertically integrated than other car companies.
And which we're not now, we certainly will be.
And then we also have to create actually our sales and service and distribution system in, I don't know, something in the order of 40 countries, somewhere, it will be over 100 countries.
Whereas the other car companies do not own their sales and service and distribution.
So they kind of assemble parts from a supplier base and then hand them to a dealer base.
So it's just like — it's not just — it's like comparing Tesla to a car company, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla, we're like maybe 10% in common with other car companies.
"
1408,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,26,"Yes, I think you're probably right about that.
I mean, RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?
"
1409,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,27,"It will be obsolete long term, yes.
I mean — yes.
"
1410,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,28,"I mean several years from now.
It's not like existing cars stop having value.
It's just that if you have a structural pack, where the pack is contributing structural value to the car because of like the — sort of like the composite honeycomb effect of share transfer between upper and lower plate, then anything that doesn't do that is going to have to have duplicate hardware.
It's going to weigh more.
It's going to cost more.
And then the same goes for the front and rear castings.
To be frank, we're trying to make the car like you'd make a toy.
If you had a toy model car, how would — and then it's got to be real cheap and look great, how would you make that? You'll cast it.
And that's how it's done.
It would be absurd to make it up of tiny little pieces of stamp metal joined in complex ways.
So it's sort of a natural thing to do.
And then the same goes for using the energy storage, the battery as a structure, which is done for aircraft wings and for rockets.
The early rockets and aircraft, they had a separate aeroshell from the propellant tanks or fuel tanks, and then they realized that doesn't make sense.
And you've got to integrate — you've got to have your fuel tank in wing shape.
You've got to have your propellant tanks in the shape of the body of the rocket, for example.
You don't want to put a box on a box, basically.
So — which over many years made it like basically uncompetitive to have an aircraft that has separate fuel tanks from the wings.
The wings need to be fuel tanks.
But like I wouldn't think of this as like it's like an overnight transition.
It's several years.
But then like I said, over time, it just won't be competitive to have a different architecture, in my opinion.

1413,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,31,"Yes.
I mean here's the way to think about that product, in my opinion.
You have to say, I think, what do you want the world to look like? When you look around the neighborhood in the future, decade from now, what do you want? What products are going to make your life better? What future do you want? And I think a future where we've got beautiful roofs generating energy that are tough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and alive with energy, that's the future we want.
Solar Roof is a killer product.
This will become obvious next year.
"
1414,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,32,"Well, yes, as I think about this today, I mean Tesla is probably — there's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla.
Every major product line is a start-up.
Every big new plant is a start-up.
And sometimes, frankly, we have to learn the lesson a few times before it sinks in.
But even things like service and sales are start-ups.
Other car companies, OEMs, they don't own their sales and service.
So we have to create our service network.
We have to create our sales and delivery network.
We have to do this in, I don't know, 40 countries, multiple languages.
Something that people don't really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the core technology that runs the company.
We are not dependent on enterprise software.
Like for those who understand what this means, this is a very big deal.
And my hat is off to the great work of the internal applications team.
They are like the nervous system, the operating system of the company, the Tesla operating system, extremely fundamental.
Obviously, insurance is substantial.
So insurance could very well be, I don't know, 30%, 40% of the value of the car business, frankly.
And as we've talked about before, with a much better feedback loop, instead of being statistical, it can be specific.
And obviously, somebody does not have to choose our insurance.
But I think a lot of people will.
It's going to cost less and be better, so why wouldn't you? And the whole autonomy thing is a start-up.
The computer chip was — designing our computer chips was a start-up.
Obviously, cells are a start-up.
Designing and making our own power electronics for the grave unit, designing, manufacturing our own motors.
Chargers, the Supercharger network is a start-up.
The thing, I think, that people just don't really understand about Tesla is that it's a whole chain of start-ups.
And they're like, well, you didn't do that before.
Yes, but we're doing it now.
I mean I think, so far, we have not — we've maybe been a bit slow with some of the start-ups, but I don't think we've had any of them fail.
So, so far, so good.
No plans to spin anything out.
That just sounds like added complexity.
"
1415,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,33,"I think we're going to focus on enabling the robotaxi system.
So you can just basically — like that's a sub — that's just really quite a small subset of the overall robotaxi or robocar thing, where you can have the car be autonomous for you.
You can have the car be — share with friends and family.
You can add or remove it from the network.
You can have it be entirely in the network.
I mean if you're an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a fleet of 10 cars.
This sort of seems like a shepherd tending the flock type of thing.
It's like you just get more, way more leverage.
So I think that's sort of — we could do that.
It wouldn't be very difficult, but we're going to just be focused on just having an autonomous network that has sort of elements of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.
Yes.
"
1416,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,34,"Yes.
Go ahead, Drew.
"
1417,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,35,"Yes.
Absolutely.
I think like the heat — for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries both as a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very significant.
Same thing could be applied to a home with the water heater, and the back of pack itself, of course.
So I think there's potential for an integrated home system that kind of does power generation/storage, heating/cooling, air filtration, water purification in a really tight package.
We don't actually have like a prototype or anything, but I think conceptually, that is something that would be probably good to have.
"
1418,TSLA,2020,3,elon-musk,chief-executive-officer,False,36,"Well, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it's really important to separate out affordability from value for money.
If the car is too expensive or any given product is too expensive, and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buy it no matter what the value proposition is.
So it is important to lower the prices in order to — such that people can literally just have enough money to buy it.
I do not think we lack for desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability.
And so we have to improve the affordability of our products so they are not out of reach of people.
We want to bring them more in reach over time but also improve our cost of production.
Obviously, we get hopefully a little bit better every year, sometimes a lot better.
And in terms of margins, all of these margins are going to look pretty comically small when you factor in autonomy.
"
1419,TSLA,2020,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company-inc.,True,0,"Thanks so much, guys.
Yes.
You're talking about in-sourcing a number of processes.
Can you talk a little bit about which processes you're moving in-house and the equipment that you're planning to make yourself versus some of the equipment that you'd be buying from other folks?
"
1420,TSLA,2020,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company-inc.,True,1,"Well, cell manufacturing, I'm pretty sure as well as on the molds that you talked about.
But in terms of the CapEx budget that you mentioned earlier, talking about the — a number of processes coming in-house and which equipment pieces you're planning to make yourself versus buying?
"
1421,TSLA,2020,3,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-and-company-inc.,True,2,"OK.
And then the second question is really around the balance sheet has really changed.
You guys have run off, land, and you've got a lot more cushion at this point.
And obviously, there's opportunities around insurance to drive out some of the cost of ownership as well as financials.
How are you guys thinking about that as you move into trying to accelerate demand a little bit and your ability to leverage your access to capital and enable some of those other products? Is that changing from where you've been in the past?

Thanks, Martin.
Overall, our financial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 being another great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned.
On net income, we achieved our fifth sequential quarter of profitability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operating margins.
Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 profitability.
First, the regulatory credits business was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this year compared to last.
Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second and third tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter.
Additionally, we have begun expensing one more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense.
I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core business.
On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to 23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin.
Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year to over 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.
We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the feet — across the fleet.
Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
Additionally, our solar deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days of payables.
Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y investments in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin.
As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
This is driven by an increase in in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing, as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, the payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last 1.5 years.
We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.
So congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few comments.
"
1425,TSLA,2020,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yes.
Two things I'll add to that.
Without a doubt, I mean, we're moving forward to push as much volume as we reasonably can.
So Elon talked to earlier kind of how the S-curve and the time line of incremental factories looks like.
And so we're moving full speed ahead with as much volume as we can reasonably move forward with.
The second comment I'd make is, if you just look at the journey of the company over the last 1.5 years, we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite a number of price reductions over that period of time, and we have cut OpEx fairly stable during that period of time as well.
And so the key is what Elon mentioned here.
I mean we have to improve the affordability of the vehicle.
We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure of not only COGS but of OpEx, which we've demonstrated over the last 1.5 years, I think, quite successfully, and improve the value of the vehicles at the same time.
So in addition to reducing the cost of the car, we're making the cars better.
And that's the formula to sell the volume.
That's what we're focused on.
"
1426,TSLA,2020,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yes.
We'll...
"
1427,TSLA,2020,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes, we'll provide guidance on 2021 after next earnings call.
"
1428,TSLA,2020,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Sure.
On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.
With respect to product margins, what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.
Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs.
It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target.
As Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that.
But we're generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin, strength in Model Y margins.
And not too far off of this, we're seeing strength in Model 3 Fremont, S and X margins.
So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.
"
1429,TSLA,2020,3,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yes.
But what I think I would say generally to the question is, I mean, we've been in a position for some time now where we are prioritizing where in the world we send our production.
And there's different factors to that depending upon when different product changes are made, what the logistics routing looks like, different things going on in different markets.
But we are in a position where we need to prioritize.
I mean what we're trying to do as fast as we possibly can is get production up higher so that we're not in a position of needing to prioritize again.
There are — yes, I think that gets at the sentiment of your question.

1431,TSLA,2020,3,jerome-guillen,"president,-automotive-division",False,0,"Yes.
We continue the development of the Semi.
And in particular, Megachargers, we realized that the 350-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going to be enough for Semi.
So we're looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging at first the Semi as during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break, yes.
So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi.
That's the goal.
We're working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard infrastructure that will be able to be deployed for all customers.
Yes.
That's probably all I can say at this point, yes.
So we're not working on...

1436,TSLA,2020,3,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering-;-vice-president,-technology",False,1,"Yes.
The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium plating on the anode.
And while the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn't change the anode plating story.
Electro design and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how to avoid that lithium plating problem.

And that's definitely applicable to the home needs of heating and cooling the home and the water in your house, so certainly applicable.

Lithium is less volumetrically dense in the pure metal form than it is intercalated into silicon.
So it's kind of hard to understand, but that's the truth.
And then as we showed in our presentation, the total anode cost that we're talking about is only $1 or $2 per kilowatt hour.
So the value of like removing the anode material isn't super high either.

Just on the quarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin.
Was China accretive to gross margin in the second quarter? And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model 3? And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to insourcing is varying by region.

Let's go to questions from institutional investors first.
The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey toward the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond Model 3, Y and the Cybertruck, cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y or region-specific vehicles or anything else?
"
1464,TSLA,2020,2,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,12,"OK.
The second question from institutional is what is your vision for software at Tesla? What opportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than by FSD?
"

What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones? And how do you think about timing?
"
1466,TSLA,2020,2,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,14,"Thank you.
And the next question from institutional investors is, please, may you update us on Alien Dreadnought? How has your thinking evolved? And what is needed in order to get closer to fundamental physical limits?
"
1467,TSLA,2020,2,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,15,"And the last question from institutional investor is how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
"
1468,TSLA,2020,2,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,16,"OK.
And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
The first one is Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street despite Elon's comments about growth rate exceeding automotive.
Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook? How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?
"
1469,TSLA,2020,2,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,17,"Thank you.
And the second question is now that it's time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more detail on production plans? What weekly production rate is considered volume production? And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
"
1470,TSLA,2020,2,martin-viecha,senior-director-for-investor-relations,False,18,"Thank you.
The next question is Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard 3 Range version of Model Y, no longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
Does this shift from smaller-pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past? What are the biggest constraints now?

1471,TSLA,2020,2,toni-sacconaghi,alliancebernstein,True,0,"Yes.
Thank you.
You mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin with PTI margin progress, and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time.
Maybe you could shed a little light on that? Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI.
For Porsche, it's smaller, at 17%.
For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%.
What do we think about? And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because I know your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1%, excluding EV credit.
So it's a 4-point contribution right now.
How do we think about ultimately what industry-leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatory credits? And I have a follow-up, please.
"
1472,TSLA,2020,2,toni-sacconaghi,alliancebernstein,True,1,"Thank you.
And if I could just follow up.
Elon, you've talked a lot about the mission of the company and really trying to drive EV adoption globally.
So how do you think about that trade-off between driving toward industry-leading profitability yet trying to make your cars more affordable and broader? It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of I'd rather drive more growth and more adoption because, ultimately, that's the mission of the company.
And we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price reductions.
You could have probably kept price where it is, sold some units and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company, has made.
So how do you personally think about that trade-off between -- even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, wouldn't you be inclined to give more of that back to drive a greater adoption more quickly?

1474,TSLA,2020,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,0,"Yes.
I was going to expand on that.
I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not just automation but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from like when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit.
And we're learning so much through doing that.

Like the same goes in all areas of cell, supply chain, manufacturing materials, design, we are solving this problem, and we're treating it like any other problem that we have solved.
We will solve this problem, talented people to join us as we solve this problem.

Less money means less time, so that's a great advantage.
And also reducing this -- and there still is a lot, the amount of inefficiencies.
We want every operation to add value to the vehicle, value, meaning moving the atoms closer to the final state.
So we do not want any robot that just moves things.
"
1481,TSLA,2020,2,drew-baglino,"senior-vice-president,-powertrain-and-energy-engineering",False,7,"We want more people.
We don't find enough people.
People who are interested in designing new lines and trying to do things different, Tesla's got a job for you.
And now we've got jobs everywhere.
It's not only in California.
Now we've got just in China, in Berlin, in Austin, Texas and in California.
So there's plenty of exciting places, and all these places will do original work and challenging meaningful work.

I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid-tied storage battery of megawatt-hour scale.
We're working with utilities, large and small, not just utilities, but also just like micro grid and project developers of all type and building our own projects where it makes sense.
And there's a lot of demand for the product, and we're growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product.
And then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid-type batteries.
It's an autonomous energy market participation system that does high-frequency trading, in short.

It's ensuring that the battery is doing everything it can to manage the grid intermittency of the renewals -- renewables and just grid intermittency of all kinds.
I mean, people turn their lights on and off, power plants turn on and off, factories ramp up and down, and batteries are great to solve those problems.

1488,TSLA,2020,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Hi.
Good afternoon.
Could you please characterize the current near-term demand environment for your vehicles? These are obviously unusual times.
I think back in Q1, you had indicated record backlog, I guess, at the beginning of this past quarter.
I haven't seen any specific comments about new orders or backlog in the release today.
So can you give us some color?
"
1489,TSLA,2020,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"OK.
So --
"
1490,TSLA,2020,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,2,"OK.
So when you're saying achieving 500,000 deliveries has become more difficult, was it really just a function of the recent shutdowns and some of these supply dynamics?
"
1491,TSLA,2020,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,3,
1492,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yes.
Thanks, Martin.
I want to start by thanking our employees, customers and suppliers for your support over the last quarter.
In particular to the Tesla team, I couldn't be more impressed with the hard work and the resiliency that you all have shown.
On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S.
factories and field operations around the world.
To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and non-critical patent projects.
The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost-savings actions.
Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
On automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, is this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%.
This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency due to the various shutdowns.
Despite these charges, we continue to make progress reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass through savings to customers around the world on some of our products.
With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period.
The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.
Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million.
While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.
Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
In the energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
We remain production-constrained in this business and are continuing to work toward building additional capacity.
And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume.
Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2.
This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&A within operating expenses.
On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which included free cash flows of over $400 million.
This is a strong result on its own despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as well as movements in working capital.
A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.
While our AR balance is usually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors.
First, overall, less than 30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales.
Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter.
Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV incentive programs, both of which have been increasing.
Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to reduce driving down this balance.
As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital management.
This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of three new factories over the next year and a half.
"
1493,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yes.
We have been experimenting on that.
So FSD remains, by far and away, the biggest opportunity in the near term, but we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right.
So premium connectivity subscription is something that we've put in place and the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost or upgrading a Standard Range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats.
So these are things that we have and we're continuing to get feedback from the field and other things that we can launch, and we'll trickle those in with time.
"
1494,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yes.
And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce manufacturing and distribute our cars.
That cost curve, even for mature products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that.
Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.
You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, particularly Full Self-Driving, there's the revenue recognition portion of that that we have today, that that will expand as we release more features.
And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, revenue from a ride-hailing network.
Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.
There's still incredible opportunity there that we were working on, particularly on how customers interact with the company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them.
So we continue to see efficiencies there.
So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low-teens operating margin level.
And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
So I hear your point on the 5% and the 1%.
We're on a bit of a journey here, and we're continuing to be partner.
"
1495,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,3,
1496,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yes.
So we'll start production next year, as we announced it before.
I'm personally very excited about the project.
I can't wait.
We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars, but we're going to accelerate that.
I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla, to carry our own freight, probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route.
We're going to prove that.
We have very good reliability.
And so far, the early units do have it, but we'll do that at a larger scale.
And we have also promised some early units to some long term, very patient and supportive customers, and we'll do that.
Now we have more sales coming up in next year, as Elon just pointed out.
So we can increase the diversity of the portfolio.
It didn't make sense up to now to do it.
But we'll be ready.
And that's maybe a little biased.
I'm very excited about this.
And we have a lot of very unique technology that we're always dreaming about that we will be putting into that Semi.
It will be just awesome.
Yes.
"
1497,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yes.
We were joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance question that on funsay.com here.
We are working super hard on insurance.
I'll go into a little bit more deal here than I have in the past.
Currently, we have a product in California, as I've described before.
It's been quite well received, and I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that are unique to our cars.
So you can think of it as a version one of Tesla Insurance.
"
1498,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"0.9.
What we're working on now is -- we can call it version two or we can call it the first version of our Telematics product.
And so really, ultimately, where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is to be able to use the data that's captured in the car, in the driving profile of the person in the car to be able to assess correlations and probabilities of crash and be able then to assess a premium on a monthly basis for that customer.
And what makes this very exciting for us is the amount of data that is available with the customer's permission to use is not available on any other product or any other vehicle in the world.
So this gives us a unique advantage in terms of information.
And we have a decision point here where we could take the California product and replicate that into other states or we could delay going into additional states and instead put more effort into the Telematics side of this, and we chose the latter.
And where we are now is nearly complete with the risk and cost analysis associated with the first version of the Telematics product.
We hope to be filing that in a handful of states with regulators very shortly.
And assuming that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in a handful of states by the end of the year.And then we'll continue to file for approval in additional states.
With regulatory approval there, we'll continue to roll this out nationwide as quickly as we can.
And then that product, as we continue to collect more data and reiterate on it, there'll be version two, version three, etc.
as we continue to refine that.
"
1499,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Sorry.
So there was the second part of this question.
Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride-hailing network? And so I think I've answered this before in prior calls.
But by the time the ride-hailing network is available, we will -- Tesla Insurance coverage will be provided to folks who are in this network.
It's a different type of insurance because of the use of the car.
It's not decided whether third-party insurance versus Tesla Insurance will be required.
There might be some things we need to think through there.
But Tesla Insurance, at least, will be working for the ride-hailing network.
"
1500,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yes.
Just to start with the gross margin questions.
We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
So we think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin.
And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
They're not quite there.
Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production.
And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
"
1501,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"There is also a lot -- very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in China.
"
1502,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"And so far, we're in negotiations with -- for Berlin, and we've awarded a lot of business, also a lot of suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe that are eager to support the factory in Berlin, yes.
"
1503,TSLA,2020,2,zachary-kirkhorn,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Sure.
I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit.
We manage the business -- said differently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contribute in a significant way to the future.
I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to 2019, and it will continue for some period of time.
But eventually, the stream of regulatory credits will reduce.
"
1504,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thank you.
First of all, I'd like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the second quarter despite tremendous difficulties.
They've done an incredible job, and it's an honor to work with such a great team.
I mean, there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they got it done and just what a great group to work with.
Like I said, it's just an honor to work with such a great team.
And as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable quarter.
And although the automotive industry was down about 30% year over year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year.
So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up.
We're also very excited to announce that we're going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.
It's going to be right near Austin.
It will be about -- I'll just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions.
But the location is five minutes from Austin National Airport and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin.
And it's about 2,000 acres, and we're going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning.
It's right on the Colorado River, so there's actually going to be a boardwalk where there'll be a hiking and biking trail.
It's going to basically be an ecological paradise, birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
So not closed and only Tesla.
So if anyone is interested in looking at a Giga Texas with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know.
This is -- we're going to be doing a major factory there, and it's also where we'll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.
And we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America.
Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California, but we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of North America.
And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
And just to emphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck and Semi programs in Texas.
And I also want to just do a shout-out to Tesla and just say thank you very much for the Tulsa team, the economic development team and the governor.
Really, I was super impressed.
The whole Tesla team was super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of Tesla down the road.
Let's see is there anything more I want to say about? There's a lot of information.
So anything, guys? All right.
Well, I'm sure they have lots of questions.
We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work.
So it's already under way.
It's out of this weekend.
Let's see, moving on to other subjects, Solar.
We recently adjusted -- recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar.
So Tesla Solar is the lowest-cost solar in the United States, and we added the lowest-cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee.
So we're very confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the Solar Retrofit, the Solar Roof.
Our Solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S.
average.
After the Federal Tax Credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt.
And it's very simple, highly automated, single-click experience.
So definitely, think about Tesla, whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want Solar on your existing roof, either way, we're the company to go to and then as you also get a Powerwall and have energy independence and be your own utility.
So I think that product is really coming together, and it's only going to better later this year.
So just very excited about that business potential.
On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range.
So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles.
I mean, you basically can drive from L.A.
to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrive, and this is at highway speed.
So you don't have to anything -- drive slowly or anything drive -- you can just drive and go very long distances.
And then for Full Self-Driving, we launched traffic license stop signs, and we continue to improve that to make them more robust.
And we're currently testing Full Self-Driving software for intersections and city streets and narrow streets.
So I personally tested the latest Alpha build of the Full Self-Driving software when I drive my car, and it is really, I think, profoundly better than people realize, yes, really profound.
It's like amazing.
So it's almost getting to a point where I can go from my house to work with no interventions despite going through construction and widely varying situations.
So this is why I'm very confident about its Full Self-Driving functionality being complete by the end of this year.
It's because I'm literally driving it.
In conclusion, I'd like to, again, say thanks for all the hard work of the Tesla team, achieving our first full year of profitability in the company history.
It was incredibly difficult and just as a result of the hard work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide.
And yes, just think about the next 12 to 18 months, we'll have three new factories in place.
Things are looking great with Giga Berlin, and we'll have Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Full Self-Driving.
There's so much to be excited about.
It's really hard to kind of fit into this call.but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing engineering front, is mind-blowing.
And then, of course, there's Factory Day, which is coming up pretty soon.
And I think that's really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.
So with that, thanks again for your support on our long-term mission, and we're looking forward to having a great journey with you to create amazing products and continue scaling it.
And, yes, this is -- I think I've never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla and the history of the company.
Thank you.
"
1505,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"I don't think we can comment on our detailed product road map beyond what's announced because we want to reserve that for product launches, but it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher-capacity past vehicle of some kind.
These are likely things at some point, but I do think there's a long way to go with 3 and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
So it's a long way to go with those.
I think we'll do the obvious things.
"
1506,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Yes.
So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.
"
1507,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Well, right now, zero; but long term, a lot.
"
1508,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yes.
It's our biggest property, true.
"
1509,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yes.
I can't emphasize.
I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
So I mean, the energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business.
So you feel like how big is the energy sector? Bigger than automotive.
And in order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is going to be primarily solar and followed by wind, and those are intermittent.
So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the solar energy because the wind doesn't always blow, and the sun doesn't always shine.
So there's like three elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energy generation; battery storage; and electric transport, those three things.
And the mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy, so I can't emphasize enough.
Yes, the battery and solar will both be enormous, and they kind of have to be in order to -- for us to have a sustainable future.
And we've got a great product road map on that front as well.
So we're going to ship in the Megapack.
It's very well received.
Drew, you want to talk about that?
"
1510,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"That's a bad word.
"
1511,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"How should free instant energy called front running.
We're not doing that.
"
1512,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yes.
Its just grid stabilization at the most heightened level, so it just shows that things are super smooth.
It's like a UPS, uninterruptible power supply, of a normal size but just ensure that this grid is smooth sailing.
And then the batteries, the computers, like all, interact with each other and make sure that they're working together to make the grid smooth.
And this can be done with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks all working together and interacting with third-party systems as well.
"
1513,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Yes.
"
1514,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"It's just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
"
1515,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Yes.
The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.
That's the real limit.
So that's why we're going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint.
And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
So whatever may be an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
And there's a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
"
1516,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing.
I think the upgrading of the fleet to Full Self-Driving, especially with an over-the-air software update.
I mean, we go down as the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change.
Maybe there's something bigger, but it seem would be one of the biggest -- I can't think of anything bigger.
So overnight, 1 million -- depending on exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions, you have like at least a few million cars, suddenly becoming five times more valuable or something like that.
It's only five times higher utility.
They go from like 12 hours a week of utility, something like that.
Or it doesn't mean hours are used to 60, something like that.
So everything else is pretty small by comparison.
Now when things do become Full Self-Driving, so what are we going to do in the car? Well, I guess we're probably going want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind or maybe play games and do work.
That's in the future.
We're already putting some games and stuff on the car, just for fun.
"
1517,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Yes.
And there's like two general classes of cell.
There's like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based.
The nickel-based cells have higher energy density so longer range.
Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack, you have to subtract in cargo.
So it's very important to have a mass efficient and long-range pack for four batteries.
What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China.
And that that will be in volume production later this year.
So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200 -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.
And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy density.
So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
We use very little cobalt in our system already, and that's -- that may to zero along, so it's basically about nickel.
"
1518,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Well, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel, OK? Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel, and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever.
Go for efficiency, as environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.
Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.
So hopefully, this message goes out to all mining companies.
Please get nickel.
With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for Range is going to be, just in U.S.
EPA terms, approximately 300 miles.
So I think people will really come to expect that as some number close to 300 miles as normal.
That's a standard expectation because you do need to take into account, like, is it very hot outside or very cold? Or are you driving up into a mountain with a full load? And it's -- people don't want to have -- get to the destination with like 10 miles range.
They want some reasonable margins.
So I think 300 is going to be really -- or close to 300 is going to be a new normal, call it 500 kilometers, basically, roughly.
"
1519,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Sure.

1520,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Version 0.9 is it getting at least.
"
1521,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"Yes.
I mean, at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the accuracy of your information? Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in the rearview mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections and inform the driver that -- how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce their insurance, as Zach was alluding to.
It's like, OK, you're driving too fast.
You're on this, that, the other thing.
It's like if you want to pay more for insurance, you can.
But if you want to pay less, then please don't drive so crazy.
Then people can make a choice.
Like, OK, they want to drive aggressively.
In that case, it'll be higher insurance.
Or they want more capital enter driving and pay less.
This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insurance expense.
A lot of it is just -- it's like a little fender bender and the net fender bender because of the way that the body collision repair is being done.
It costs like $15,000 or something crazy and like -- and then we can actually adjust the design of the car and adjust how the repair is done to actually have the fundamental cost of solving that problem would be less.So this has helped us under a whole bunch of facility things that we were doing basically without realizing it.
But this is a problem with -- in general, with insurance is like if the insurance is, like, all you can eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is sweet.
So this gives us a great feedback for improvement because it's basically a fundamentally better insurance product.
I'd also like to say, I'm inspired of recruiting because if there's one thing I'd like to come out of this call, it's that a lot of great people want to join Tesla.
That's the other one thing I'd like to take on this call.
And on the insurance front, I want to be clear.
We're building a great -- like a major insurance company.
If you're interested in revolutionary insurance, please join Tesla.
I would love to have some high-energy actuaries especially.
I have great respect for the actuarial profession.
Your guys are great at math.
Please join Tesla.
Especially if you want to change things and you're annoyed by how slow the industry is, this is the place to be.
We want revolutionary actuaries.
"
1522,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Yes.
I mean, the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory, and it's continuing to do more and more internally.
But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world, and just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month from 40 -- it was like 40% at the beginning this year, something like that.
It will be like 80% by the end of this year, maybe more.
"
1523,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"Yes.
I will say it like this.
The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the most competitive in the world.
"
1524,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Yes.
Well, obviously, Germany has a great automotive industry and supply chain.
So actually, a ton of our suppliers are in Germany within like a few hundred kilometers of the factory.
"
1525,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Yes.
I mean, it's worth telling that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S.
received zero federal tax credit, whereas many of our competitors are, like, they get a $7,500 pack tax credit.
And yet our sales have continued to do well.
Yes.
"
1526,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,22,"Well, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy.
I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially almost everyone when you're factoring in autonomy, but that was really a mega game changer, giga game changer, yes.
But I mean, it is important for people to distinguish between two things.
There's value for money that our product has, and then there's affordability.
And even if you have real-life money and have value for money, like infinite, if people don't have enough -- if people do not have enough money in their bank account to buy the car, they simply cannot.
So then you used to have this cycle or something that nobody can buy, so it is important to make the car affordable.
And we will not succeed in our mission if we do not make cars affordable.
Like the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough.
We need to fix that.
So we're all making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress.
So yes, we need to not go bankrupt.
Obviously, that's important because that will fail in our mission, but we're not trying to be super profitable either.
Obviously, profitability is like 1% or something, this 1% or 2%.
It's not crazy.
Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%.
So we want to be profitable.
Like I think just we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that's what we're trying to achieve.
"
1527,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Yes.
But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to Full Self-Driving.
Depending upon how you calculate, it is probably worth at least $100,000 per car.
So it's a lot of software you have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes.
"
1528,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Demand is not a problem, definitely not.
We do have some production supply chain challenges we're trying to slow right now.
For example, the Model Y, we're body casting, obviously, because it's new technology.
It's been tricky to maintain rates and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting, which is -- it's a two-piece casting with a bunch -- and there's about half a dozen other parts that are added on that will transition to a one-piece casting.
In fact, I'm super excited about this.
We're going to have a -- the world's biggest casting press is getting assembled right now, actually, in Fremont for the Model Y rear body casting.
It's enormous and looks awesome.
So it's -- look, the things that are troubling us right now are not demand, that they are just a bunch of firefighting on supply chain and production issues.
"
1529,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Sorry.
Yes, don't worry about demand.
That's not the issue.
"
1530,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,26,"Yes.
It's not true at demand.
It's really just a production issue.
It's been pretty hard when you've got like a global supply chain, and it's kind of whatever the most effective part of supply chain is that sets your rate.
I mean, the number of rabbits do know how to pull out of a hat for supply chain is insane.
Team has done an amazing job.
So I think also some of our costs were related to having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around because of part shortages, so we'll hopefully use fewer airplanes.
That will improve our costs, but demand exceeds supply right now.
That's where we are now.
"
1531,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,27,"OK.
We can't say too much about this, except that where there will be local cell production and -- that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory.
Drew, is there anything -- Berlin factory.
Drew, is there anything -- yes?
"
1532,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,28,"Yes.
And like -- so my biggest concern for getting our talented people is just probably Berlin because the labor mobility in Europe is not as low.
I would recommend changing this.
Like somebody wants to leave and join another company.
Sometimes they have to spend six months on garden leave.
It's called garden, hanging out in the garden basically, and like this is not a good use of people's time.
I mean, if they want us to hang out on the garden, that's fine, but they shouldn't have to.
"
1533,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,29,"I mean, those are now Europe.
We know what we're talking about.
"
1534,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,30,"Yes.
Maybe sooner with Battery Day.
OK.
Thanks.

1535,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,31,
1536,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,32,"Well, the actual major milestone that's happening right now is really a transition of the autonomy system or the cars, like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in -- like two-and-a-half feet.
It's like think -- things like isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are harshly correlated in time but not very well and transitioning to kind of a 4D, where it's like -- which is video essentially.
You're thinking about the world in three dimensions and the fourth dimension being time.
So that architectural change, which has been under way for some time but has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet, is what really matters for Full Self-Driving.
So what we've been doing, thus far, has really just been like 2D -- mostly 2D, and like I said, well correlated in time.
So just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system would work -- does work.
It's capable of things that if you just look -- looking at things as individual pictures as opposed to video -- basically, like you could go from like individual pictures to surround video, so it's fundamental.
So the car will seem to have just like a giant improvement.
We'll probably roll it out later this year.
We'll be able to do traffic lights, stop, turns, thrust, everything, pretty much.
And then it will be a long march of nines, essentially.
How many nines of reliability are OK.
So it's definitely way better than human, but how much better than human does need to be.
So that's actually going to be the real work.
There's just a massive amount of work with each, kind of, order of magnitude of reliability, but you'll see it happen.
And if you plot the points on the curve, it would be kind of office where it's ended.
AI, in general, I think, is something -- I've been saying this AI drum for a decade.
We should be concerned about where AI is going.
The people I see being the most strong about AI are the ones who are very smart because they can't imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them.
That's the flaw in the logic.
They're just way dumber than they think they are.
"
1537,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,33,"Well, we bring a massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makes the machine.
There's probably 1,000%, maybe 10,000% more engineering required for the factory than for the product itself, so we're certainly making progress.
I mean, battery and powertrain factory, Gigafactory in Nevada is, I don't know, alien-driven or version is 0.5, something like that, starting to approach version 1.
We're getting way better at making cars.
You can see that in Giga Shanghai.
You'll see that even more with Berlin, and we're really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable.
The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin.
It may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we've done to date.
Drew, would you like to add to that?
"
1538,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,34,"Vertical integration is extremely important to this.
But the supply chain, if you put like a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane.
It would be like, wow.
It went around the world like six times.
So with vertical integration, maybe you can only go around the world once.
It would be a huge improvement or not even like half -- I think I get vertical integration in litigation an order of magnitude improvement, so yes.
And its -- do you want to, Drew?
"
1539,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,35,"It's a better factory for less money in less time.
"
1540,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,36,"Or in fact, it's like we want to be super respectful of people's labor.
If we're asking somebody to do something, are we sure it's useful? Are we asking them to spend their time in a way that is respectful of their time? But it's like, wow, the -- like the potential for improvement is tremendous.
But it's -- I just want to be clear, at Tesla, we love manufacturing.
It's awesome, and I really think more smart people should be working on manufacturing.
"
1541,TSLA,2020,2,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,37,"Yes.
Absolutely.
It's actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems.
And I think that for some reason, I kind of got a bad rap, especially in the U.S., for a long time.
And I think people didn't think that manufactured -- they sort of put manufacturing is like, oh, this is for some boring, just making copies, whatever.
But actually, there's far more opportunity for innovation in manufacturing than in the products itself, order magnitude.
So like if there's one thing that comes out of this call, it's like, hey, if you want to help us invent amazing, new manufacturing techniques and have input into the product itself, it's not like you just get touch the product and say, hey, make this product, and it's kind of a lousy design.
If you're manufacturing, you get to change the product design, and say, hey, this product, you're asking your manufacturers dumb.
Like, great, let's fix it.
So it has -- if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don't just get force fed a sandwich.
You get to change the product design.
So it's super exciting.
And we evolve the lines even after they're both this rapid evolution of the production system.
So --
"
1542,TSLA,2018,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,0,"Thanks very much.
Can you talk a little bit about the geographic dispersion for the guidance for 2019, where you're expecting the Model 3s to sell through as well as the other models?
"
1543,TSLA,2018,4,colin-rusch,oppenheimer-&-co.-inc.,True,1,"OK.
Thanks, guys.
And then just in terms of the cost reduction road map and rework postfactory, can you talk a little bit about your expectation for reducing that in the next couple of quarters and what the order of magnitude is on that in your model internally?

1545,TSLA,2018,4,dan-galves,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,0,"Hey, guys.
Thanks a lot.
Do you plan to offer a U.S.
lease product for Model 3 in the U.S.? When can we expect it? And can you talk about what percentage of S and X have historically been leased in the U.S.?
"
1546,TSLA,2018,4,dan-galves,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,1,"OK.
OK.
Thanks.
And then I have just, like, two quick housekeeping questions.
One, is there a restructuring charge that you expect in the first quarter? How much is it? And is it included in your expectation of a small profit?
"
1547,TSLA,2018,4,dan-galves,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,2,"OK.
Thanks.
And then just the last one is...
"
1548,TSLA,2018,4,dan-galves,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,3,"Yes, the last one is, this change in your service parts structure to make things more distributed rather than in the parts warehouse is.

Thank you, Elon.
So my name is Zach Kirkhorn.
Just a brief background on myself.
So, I joined Tesla just under nine years ago when it's a super small company with a lot of potential ahead of us and I was attracted to the mission and the vision of the company.
Throughout that time, I've been deep in the operations of every major program of the company, from the Roadster to Model S and X, Model 3, scaling our energy business and more things to come, which we've talked about on the call.
I feel we're starting 2019 with a very strong financial foundation.
We have enough cash to continue launching new programs and developing new technologies, and we're able to service upcoming debt obligations with our forecasted cash flows.
My focus, alongside the talented and amazingly passionate team at Tesla, is to ensure we continue the terrific momentum on cost management and operational efficiency, which will enable us more -- enable more access to our products around the world, which is key to achieving the mission of the company.
On a personal note, Deepak, a huge thank you to you for your leadership, mentorship, and support and very much looking forward to discussing our progress on future earnings calls.

1556,TSLA,2018,4,colin-langan,ubs,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
Just a follow-up on the comments around you said about 700,000 to 800,000, you think, is the normal demand.
I mean, any color on what price you're expecting that to be? Because I think there's a lot of chatter that demand is already weak in -- of the midrange, at least, already in January.
I don't know if that's true as well.
"
1557,TSLA,2018,4,colin-langan,ubs,True,1,"But the target price point is, I think, in the past, you mentioned mid-$40,000.
Is that where we're thinking? Or is that the long-term range?
"
1558,TSLA,2018,4,colin-langan,ubs,True,2,"And just as a follow-up.
You commented that you expect China to be online by the end of the year, but there's a lot of articles that the battery supplier -- you're looking at different battery suppliers.
But, I mean, do you have a battery supplier? Because it seems kind of close to when production is supposed to start.

Welcome to Tesla's fourth-quarter 2018 Q&A webcast.
I'm joined today by Elon Musk, JB Straubel, Deepak Ahuja, and a number of other executives.
Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 p.m.
Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
[Operator instructions]But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
Elon?
"
1561,TSLA,2018,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,1,"I'm not sure.
I think Model T was a little bit slower, but I'm not 100% sure.

Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
"
1566,TSLA,2018,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,6,"I think what Toni meant is with the battery pack, as in battery pack as well as the powertrain together, are more expensive than an engine.

Great.
So, we're going to take the first questions from our retail investors who have been submitting their questions on say.com.
So, the question that has been submitted has been about service, which I think you already spoke at length about.
So let's go to the second question.
The second question would be: how are you feeling about demand right now across the product line? Is 500 to 700 units -- 500,000 to 700,000 units at 42,000 ASP still a realistic annual target for Model 3, even considering Model Y and its impact on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of 100,000 annually?
"
1573,TSLA,2018,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,13,"Great.
Thank you very much.
We will speak to you in three months.

1575,TSLA,2018,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,15,"OK.
The next question from Alex is, can you please share an update on full self-driving and Tesla network development? When will customers start to see full self-driving features? What's the best case time line for a Tesla network to go live?
"
1576,TSLA,2018,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,16,"OK.
Now let's go to the next question, which is, if and when will Tesla switch Model S and X to 2170 battery cells, what percent range improvement do you expect?
"
1577,TSLA,2018,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,17,"OK .
So maybe we'll take the last question from retail investors, which was, where will Tesla Semi and Model Y be produced? Can you share a time line on expected production ramp of these products?
"
1578,TSLA,2018,4,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,18,"OK.
Fantastic.
So, operator, we can start taking questions from participants on the call.

"
1582,TSLA,2018,4,toni-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein,True,0,"Yes.
Thank you.
You've talked repeatedly about the need to drive down costs, which, in turn, drives the elasticity of demand for cars.
And I'm wondering if you can talk about how much of a price differential between the $50,000 Model 3 and the $35,000 Model 3 is structural, meaning that powertrain costs for EVs are just structurally higher than they are for internal combustion engine cars and where you think that difference is today and when that is no longer a factor? So is -- or maybe said another way, is the bigger driver in getting to lower costs and lower -- and more affordability on the Model 3, is it really around the powertrain and getting that at parity? Or is it everything else about Tesla not being as efficient as other manufacturers that is causing the higher price right now? And have I follow-up, please.
"
1583,TSLA,2018,4,toni-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein,True,1,"And how big do you think that delta is today? And when it's -- do you think of it as being kind of $10,000, $11,000 for that pack plus powertrain for an electric vehicle and maybe $5,000 or $6,000 for an internal combustion engine car? And is that sort of the order of magnitude? And where do you see those getting much more aligned just sort of given the lives of where you think cell and pack costs are going?
"
1584,TSLA,2018,4,toni-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein,True,2,"OK.
OK.
And as you think about 2019, you talked about sort of scenarios for demand and how you plan to roll out the intermediate range and then ultimately the standard range.
What is -- if you do have to make a trade-off on volume or profitability during the course of the year, meaning to get the volume you need or you think you can deliver, you have to go to lower margins or vice versa, where's the trade-off? Is -- are units produced most important to you? Or is delivering the 25% gross margin more important? So if you have a chance to deliver 450,000 or 500,000 cars but they'll be more standard editions and gross margins will end the year at 20%, is that -- are you willing to make that trade-off?

The question I have is related to Waymo and the autonomous driving opportunity.
Morgan Stanley recently valued Waymo at $175 billion.
And my question is, what do they have that you don't have? And separately -- so what do they have that you don't have? And then separately, how important is the timing in the Tesla story longer term? Is this nice to have? Is it really about EVs and renewable energy? Or is the autonomy kind of one of the foundational parts of the story longer term?

Thank you.
Can you just update us on where battery costs are now and where you anticipate they'll be by year-end? I'm just trying to gauge how much of a factor this is to lowering costs and sustaining profitability.
"
1589,TSLA,2018,4,maynard-um,macquarie-group,True,1,"OK.
And maybe talk about your expectations with the Panasonic-Toyota JV and how it might impact you.

Great, guys.
I have one question and it's got four parts to it.
Happy new year, Elon.
So the first part is -- so our Street numbers, like consensus, we've got everything wrong for six years or seven years since you went public, in thereabouts $6 in earnings.
Talk to us about that, if you can.
Number two, Elon, could you talk to us about -- you talked about -- I hear you cut some workforce at SpaceX business there at Tesla.
I feel that you have a worry about global economy.
Can you talk to us about how you feel about that with your guidance in order -- in the same order? And then can we talk about, maybe sort of third thing, for JV? No one's ever going to talk about stationary storage, but we had a whole page on that with pretty good speech, and why should we be focusing on that? And what can that add to the bottom line on top of that $6 this next year? Thank you.

1593,TSLA,2018,4,daniel-ives,wedbush-securities,True,0,"Yes, thanks for taking my question.
So my question is around Europe.
Obviously, with deliveries coming onboard in the first quarter, maybe what surprised you in terms of -- your demand looks strong, but in terms of what you're seeing at the region, is it stronger than you expected in certain countries? What do you think is driving that? And maybe you can just talk about the opportunities and challenges in Europe especially from a delivery logistics perspective.
"
1594,TSLA,2018,4,daniel-ives,wedbush-securities,True,1,"And just maybe a quick follow-up on -- can you just talk about -- when we look at the Gigafactory buildout in China and obviously how important that is, can you maybe just fast forward, let's say, 18, 24 months? I mean, how do you envision that as just a competitive advantage versus maybe some other automakers that will be trying to go in your tracks? Thanks.

1596,TSLA,2018,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hey.
Thank you for taking my question.
So, Deepak, I was wondering, so as you get to 2019, we're all concerned about the potential recession, and I was wondering how you think about it and what you would tell us about what we should expect -- how we should expect Tesla to react to recession in 2019.
How do you manage your volume ramp? How do you manage your pricing? How do you present cash? How do you manage your CAPEX if things turn south in 2019? And then I have a follow-up on gross margin for Jerome.
"
1597,TSLA,2018,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"Yes, thanks.

Thank you.
Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.
"
1599,TSLA,2018,4,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,3,
1600,TSLA,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking the questions tonight.
First thing I want to just understand is on what you're seeing from European orders and China orders so far.
There are some numbers that get thrown around, but you guys are obviously taking a look at it.
How is that order profile shaping up relative to what you saw in the U.S.
with the launch of the 3?
"
1601,TSLA,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,1,"So like orders above, I think I've seen like 20,000 order levels for Europe and single-digit thousands for China.
Is it better than that, Elon?
"
1602,TSLA,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,2,"OK.
"
1603,TSLA,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,3,"OK.
Then just lastly on this demand thread, customer deposit came in again over $100 million.
Is it possible to give us an update? I know you don't think it's really a relevant number but I do want to know.
Explain why on the reservation count, where you were 450,000, you started delivering -- and I ask this because I think we're just all trying to understand how much incremental demand you think there is based on what you see at that lower price point if, say, there's over half of those people that are still waiting for that 75k base model to come out.
That would be interesting, and I think that's what you're seeing but I just want to confirm that.

1605,TSLA,2018,4,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
I think -- the amount that you've spent on lands for Gigafactory Shanghai in the classification operating cash flows, is there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how to think about CAPEX for this facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for the project? I think you've spoken in the past about the potential to raise that locally in China.
Is that still your thinking? And in what kind of terms might you be able to raise that capital? Thanks.
"
1606,TSLA,2018,4,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,
1607,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yes, Deepak here.
You're right.
The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government of China.
So it's not CAPEX , but it's operating lease.
That shows up as cash flow from operations.
However, the CAPEX that we will invest is our equipment, and we fully own it.
So that will show up as capital expenditures.
The plan, as we have indicated in the letter, is still to get funding for majority of that capital spending from local China banks.
And we expect very attractive rates based on the dialogue we've had, and there's a lot of interest.
And we hope to finalize that and then share the details at that point.
"
1608,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yes.
These are the biggest banks in the world.
And for them, $500 million is not a large amount of money on the scheme of things.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.
"
1609,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"It's around 20%, low 20s, and it stayed stable at that level for many, many quarters, which is -- it seems like the natural demand because we don't do sub-invention or artificially pump up --
"
1610,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes, it is included in that.
It's difficult to say exactly what that is.
At this point, it's, let's say, roughly around $40 million, but that number can vary slightly.
"
1611,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Sorry, go ahead.
"
1612,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"I mean, we can't really, Ben, talk about consensus and what that means.
I think the -- maybe the better approach is we are providing certain guidance here and you and the other analysts need to reflect that in your modeling.
And that's the best indication from the company of our projections.
In all fairness, that's the best way I can think of answering your question here.
"
1613,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"And the profitability of the storage business and the gross margin continue to improve as we keep ramping up production and scale.
"
1614,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Again.
"
1615,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yes.
"
1616,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"When -- close to that, yes.
"
1617,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Sure.
OK.
Thank you.
Yes -- no.
Well, first of all, Elon, thank you very much for the opportunity for me to be here and be here again a second time.
I've learned a lot from you and I've been always inspired by you, and I've been also very inspired by the team at Tesla, who are incredibly brilliant, very passionate and just amazingly perseverant, the best team I could imagine.
So thank you everybody for that.
There is no good time to make this change.
We felt generally this was a good time.
It's a new chapter, a new year.
Tesla has had two great quarters of profitability, cash flow, so now a really solid foundation.
And I feel really good about Zach taking over as the CFO.
He's proven himself with his many years of experience and many tough challenges that he's worked on and really excited to have Zach take on this role, and I'll be here to support him and make sure we are all successful as a company.
"
1618,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,11,
1619,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Correct.
We indicated in Q1, we will start delivering Model 3s in Europe and China.
And we also shared a chart showing the potential market size for mid-sized premium sedans in North America, Europe and Asia, suggesting those markets could be even bigger.
So I think that gives a good sense of where we'll be.
And we'll launch the right-hand drive version at some point to go to the other markets.
"
1620,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"OK?
"
1621,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"Jerome, do you want to answer that?
"
1622,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Yes, it's a very broad question, which is not really just for me to answer.
But I think at the highest level, the way we are trying to be prepared for any kind of contingency here is to just continue focusing on cost.
And the theme of our conversations here is, how do we reduce cost all the time and how do we run our business with a very high level of financial discipline? And Elon alluded to that and so did Jerome, I think.
That if we do that, we believe that even in some of the scenarios of lower volumes and pricing -- tight pricing, we do have a good chance and a good shot of being profitable and generate free cash flow.
So that's the best way to manage the business, be frugal.
"
1623,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"The other aspect of this, Elon, which we've been doing extremely well, is capital efficiency.
We have dramatically cut back on capital expense, and we are spending it in a very efficient manner.
We talked about it in the letter on Model 3 and Gigafactory Shanghai.
We talked about it for Model Y.
There are just so many learnings that we are incorporating, and we just want to beat what we did with Model 3 and the kind of spending we had for the returns we got.
"
1624,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,17,"Yes.
"
1625,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,18,"Yes, I mean, I think reservations are not relevant for us.
We are really focused on orders.
Now we do have a large reservations backlog still, which tells us that a lot of customers are still waiting for those cars, but I don't think it's appropriate to share the reservations number.
"
1626,TSLA,2018,4,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,19,"But I think the bigger point is that, yes, there is cost reduction opportunities out, but the bigger point is it's not that our cost is higher than a gas-powered or an internal combustion engine.
"
1627,TSLA,2018,4,jerome-guillen,president,False,0,"I want to start next year as well.
"
1628,TSLA,2018,4,jerome-guillen,president,False,1,"But the first units will be -- this is Jerome.
Well, first units will be for our own usage.
So depends how many trucks we'll use for our own usage to move the parts and the vehicle in different location, and then we'll start delivering to outside customers.
"
1629,TSLA,2018,4,jerome-guillen,president,False,2,"This is Jerome.
Well, our manufacturing is improving quarter over quarter, actually, week over week.
We take fewer hours, both here in Fremont or at the Gigafactory, to assemble the Model 3 and S and X as well.
And then we track the quality very closely.
We review that carefully with the engineers and the supply chain and the manufacturing chains.
And the quality in the field and the number of incidents is also improving week over week, every week.
So there are fewer and fewer need for cars to be in service, yes.
So we'll keep going.
There's no end in sight and we'll try to make sure that the car never breaks down.
"
1630,TSLA,2018,4,jerome-guillen,president,False,3,"It's both.
It's both, the vehicle and both the powertrain.
So I split my time half and half between the Gigafactory and here, and there is opportunities in both, yes.
"
1631,TSLA,2018,4,jerome-guillen,president,False,4,
1632,TSLA,2018,4,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Hi.
Good evening, everybody.
First, I wanted to ask you about the short-range Model 3.
What are your latest thoughts in terms of timing of introduction? I think at some point, you had in mind to do it in the -- maybe the first half of this year.
And just to clarify, when you're sort of talking about the outlook for 2019, the number of deliveries, up 50%, and then the margin target for Model 3 to get to 25%, does that assume that you're introducing a lower range -- the short-range Model 3 at some point during the year?
"
1633,TSLA,2018,4,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"And so to be clear, the -- you expect to reach at some point this year -- or you're targeting at some point this year 25% gross margins on Model 3, and that's despite introducing the lower-end -- or just the standard range Model 3.
Is that correct?
"
1634,TSLA,2018,4,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,2,"OK.
And I guess, my follow-up would be on the demand side.
So, you're talking about 50% increase this year.
You said a few times that it could be higher than this.
I think you just mentioned in the previous question 350,000 to 500,000, if I understood well.
So, what is sort of like what drives the cautious outlook that's in your letter? Because it feels like it's the -- it's just basically four times the fourth quarter run rate, which would imply sort of 50% for the full year but not really a lot of growth versus what you just accomplished.
So, I guess, how do we think about the total demand for 2019, especially if you introduced this -- the cheaper version?
"
1635,TSLA,2018,4,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,3,
1636,TSLA,2018,4,jeffrey-straubel,chief-technical-officer,True,0,"I mean, I think the letter outlines the predicted growth in the battery storage business, the stationary storage business pretty clearly, and that should be included in the projections as well.
So I mean, we're excited about it but I can't say much more detail.
"
1637,TSLA,2018,4,jeffrey-straubel,chief-technical-officer,True,1,"We continue to set production records basically every month.
So that's growing.
"
1638,TSLA,2018,4,jeffrey-straubel,chief-technical-officer,True,2,
1639,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Martin.
Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also the most successful.
Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S.
for 2018.
And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, we -- Tesla achieved an 80% market share of U.S.
sales in the last year.
I think this point is perhaps not well appreciated.
All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S.
in the last year.
So I think that's not so bad.
We also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is a tremendous achievement by the Tesla team.
The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year over year, cumulative sales deliveries year over year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen.
We've basically almost doubled our fleet in every year.
Every year, we make as many cars as we did in all prior years.
So, this is a very unusual thing to see for -- especially for a large complex manufactured object.
I think maybe the fastest that a complex manufactured object is -- like a car has grown in history or at least I'm not aware of anything that is faster.
Martin, are you?
"
1640,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"OK.
And we expect that exponential to continue.
So, with the deliveries this year being -- even in the face of -- if there's a global recession -- even if there's a global recession, we're expecting deliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year.
And this -- it could be a lot more than that.
But even with tough economic times, to receive 50% growth is pretty nutty.
For Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability, for the second quarter for the first time in the company history, and we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt in EMEA with a total of $3.7 billion of cash.
This means we have enough cash to settle our convertible bond that will mature in March.
In addition, our operating margin remains strong at 5.7%.
Operating margins in the fourth quarter are usually lower in the automotive history, but this was not the case for Tesla.
2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla.
As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase sales by 50%.
And perhaps could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number.
But that's crazy growth for the automotive industry.
I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations.
So really, from my standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service in North America.
That's No.
1.
And I think [Inaudible] very exciting [Inaudible] have been -- to roll out with the Tesla App.
We're going to get cars to China and Europe and make sure that we have good logistics for the whole delivery process, from factory gate to the customer.
That's obviously pretty far from California to get to Europe and China and make it to, again, our two customers.
So, we're working every aspect of that logistics chain.
And I think we've -- I think it's going to be good.
I would say at this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1.
Not by a lot, but I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.
So let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing out our total locations worldwide to 378.
And we increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles.
Mobile Service fleet is something we can scale up very rapidly because we don't need bricks and mortar.
We can get more vehicles, hire people, and deploy rapidly.
It also actually results from higher customer satisfaction because we can actually send one of our service vans to your work or home and fix the car without you having to bring it into the service center or do any paperwork or anything like that.
It's really seamless and visible.
The customers love it.
And we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so that instead of having to make an appointment -- to call and make an appointment, you can just open your Tesla App, say you want to make a service appointment, and it was the top 10 most frequently requested service item.
And you can -- with a couple of taps, you've made yourself an appointment.
And we're going to make it easier for the car to be picked up and dropped off as well.
So if you want -- if you prefer not coming to the service center at all, you can just request that the car be picked up and delivered.
That's something that we'll be -- so that's already -- we're going to roll that out and have a big improvement to customer satisfaction.
It rolled out two or three weeks ago.
But the next thing we're going to add is, if a car detects something wrong, like a flat tire or a drive unit failure, that before the car has even come to a halt, there is a tow truck and a service loader on the way.
The car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loader, a tow truck, are on their way before your car has even come to a stop.
Now this will be immense in improving customer happiness.
Virtually, you just call it and you have to tap the service ring to cancel it.
So, you can cancel it if you want.
You just have to -- it's not automatically going to happen.
You just press cancel.
We're also improving product distribution.
So, I think we made a strategic error in the past about not having service parts located at our service centers.
We had them in product distribution warehouses, which basically meant it was impossible to have a fast turnaround on servicing a car because the car would come in, then the parts will be requested.
They come to the service center, this would basically -- even if they're very simple, repair could take days.
So we're not -- we're going to be able to stock in all common parts at the service centers, so that it's possible to -- and first, we'll have -- get your car serviced in 20 minutes or 15 minutes, even if it's a simple matter.
I mean, it should be like Jiffy Lube, like eight minutes or whatever, 8.5.
It should be like lightning fast.
But in order to -- that we have to have the parts located at our service centers.
Also, it's going to make sense for our service centers to do basic body work or essentially if [Inaudible] replaced a front or rear [Inaudible], it makes sense to just prestock the front and rear [Inaudible] in the common colors.
So, unless you have an unusual color, we can literally replace your [Inaudible] in 15, 20 minutes.
And it's not like a suite body shop stuff.
Let's see, in terms of the new products, with Model Y, we've completed ensuring of ensign of Model Y, and the parts are [Inaudible] going up for production Model Y.
Three quarters of the Model Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CAPEX per vehicle than Model 3, and the rest is also quite low.
This is in contrast to Model S versus Model X, where the theory was -- in Model X, we just -- it's like -- it's sort of Model X to be like the sort of the Fabergé egg of cars.
It's a fast -- it's an incredible vehicle and probably one -- probably nothing like it will ever be made again, and maybe it shouldn't but it is a work of art.
It's a special work of art.
But the commonality with the Model S is limited.
It was only about maybe 30% in common with the Model S, whereas Model Y is, I think, 76% was when it got in common with the Model 3.
And we're most likely going to put Model Y production right next to -- in fact, it's part of our main Gigafactory in Nevada.
So, it will just be right there.
Batteries and powertrains will come out and go straight into the vehicle.
So that also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to transfer parts from California to Nevada.
It's not a for sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default plan.
I would expect Model Y will probably be -- the thematic Model Y will be maybe 50% higher than Model 3, could be even double.
The -- as I understand it, the midsized SUV segment is the -- worldwide is the most popular type of vehicle.
So we'll probably see a higher volume of Y than 3.
And earlier this month, we saw the construction of Gigafactory in Shanghai, and by the end of this year, we expect to be producing Model 3s using a complete vehicle production line.
That's body paint, final assembly, general assembly and module production.
So it basically would be -- this will be extremely fast.
I get like daily updates of progress of the Shanghai Gigafactory, and those factories are going to go up like lightning.
So, we do feel quite confident at this point, at least for the factories that are in our control, that we can achieve volume production in Shanghai by the end of the year.
And that should allow us to get to the 10,000 vehicles a week rate or very close to it by the end of the year.
And yes, I think that's it.
"
1641,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"I think the [Inaudible] goodness of Tesla, yes, so like the why of Tesla, the relevance, what's the point of Tesla, comes down to two things: acceleration of sustainable energy and autonomy.
The acceleration of sustainable energy is absolutely fundamental because this is the next potential risk for humanity.
So obviously that is, by far and away, the most important thing.
But also, very important is autonomy.
This has the potential to save millions of lives, tens of millions of serious public injuries and give people their time back, so that they don't have to drive, they can -- if you're on the road, you can spend time doing things that you enjoy instead of being in terrible traffic.
So it's extremely important.
We feel confident about our technical strategy, and I think we have an advantage that no one else has, which is, that we have, at this point, somewhere in the order of 300,000 vehicles on the road, with a 360-degree camera sensor suite, radar, ultrasonics, always connected uploads, especially video clips with the customer submission when there is intervention.
So effectively, we have a massive, massive training fleet.
Our -- the amount of training that we have -- if you add everyone else up combined, they're probably 5%, I'm being generous, of the miles that Tesla has.
And this difference is increasing.
A year from now, we'll probably go -- certainly from 18 months from now, we'll probably have 1 million vehicles on the road with -- that are -- and every time the customers drive the car, they're training the systems to be better.
I'm just not sure how anyone competes with that.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question...
"
1642,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Well, I think we did, actually.
Yes, it's clear in our letter.

1643,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yes, maybe in the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, I mean, like that this year.
"
1644,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yes, I think there's like some confusion about rectification.
Like I said -- like -- for us to drive the Model 3s that come off the line, when that happens is like some slight adjustment of door gaps and panel gaps and that kind of thing.
And that's all that's done.
There's nothing more than that.
"
1645,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Yes.
I mean, it's more like there are multiple factors at play here.
First of all, there's a lot of seasonality to automotive purchases.
First of all, do not buy a new car in the middle of a blizzard.
So January and February tends to be seasonally low and then picks up significantly around the early to mid-March time frame.
In the U.S., we obviously have a pull forward of demand from the tax credit.
And yes, there's -- so there's all those factors.
But I feel very confident about Model 3 demand.
The customer happiness level with the car is incredible and I think probably the highest of any car in the world right now, I think.
And so you can tell like, basically, nobody wants to sell a car.
So --
"
1646,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Yes, this is really just a guess.
So it's not like it's I have some huge crystal ball or something.
But at volume, I would expect, this is totally a guess, I want to be clear.
Probably an average of $42,000, probably at that volume level.
I'm not certain, but again -- OK.
"
1647,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Well, there's really three things: the cell, the module and the pack.
We will be making the module and the pack.
So, it's really just a question of cell supply.
And we can essentially use any high energy.
That's the 2170 chemistry.
And we expect to be a combination of cells produced at our Gigafactory in Nevada and cells produced in Japan and cells produced locally in China.
And we feel confident to have a sufficient supply to hit the 3,000 units suite.
"
1648,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Well, you could call it the standard range, but it's maybe short by Tesla's standards, but it's long range by other manufacturers' standards.
So -- yes, we expect to introduce the standard range Model 3 sometime probably the middle of this year is a rough guess.
And we're working hard to improve our costs of production, our overhead costs, our fixed costs, just costs in general.
I think this past year, while extremely difficult, has driven us to a high level of financial discipline.
I think we're way smarter about how we spend money, and we're getting better with each passing week.
We -- yes.
"
1649,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Yes.
"
1650,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Well, we need to bring the Shanghai factory online.
I think that's the biggest driver for getting to 500K plus a year.
Our car is just very expensive going into China.
We've got import duties.
We've got transport costs.
We've got higher-cost labor here.
And we've never been eligible for any of the EV tax credits.
A lot of people [Inaudible] sort of dependent on incentives.
In fact, we are [Inaudible] EVs, we have the least access to incentives.
It's pretty crazy because there's so many companies that -- countries that have put price caps on the EV incentive, which differentially affects Tesla.
And in China, which is the biggest market for EVs, we've never had any subsidies or tax incentives for vehicles.
So it's difficult.
If [Inaudible] it is eligible for that although it sounds like that's going to be reducing in China in the coming years.
But really, bottom line is, we need the Shanghai factory to achieve that 10k rate and other cars be affordable.
The demand for -- it's important to appreciate that the demand for Model 3 is insanely high.
The inhibitor is affordability.
It's just like people literally don't have the money to buy the car.
It's got nothing to do with desire.
They just don't have enough money in their bank account.
If the car can be made more affordable, the demand is extraordinary.
"
1651,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"I mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide is something -- in a strong economy, it's something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year.
That's my best guess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy.
If the economy goes into a recession, then I think that could be something under 40% less.
But I think even in a recession, worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3.
For S and X, we did eliminate the 75 [Indiscernible] version of S and X and it provided more differentiation relative to 3 and then Y that's coming out.
I think we could see a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think the net cash flow from S and X is likely to be very similar.
So probably no major change in net cash flow for S and X.
"
1652,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Yes, I don't want to be a broken record about this.
It's costs, costs, costs, because reducing our costs.
By the way, while making improvements to Model 3, I want to emphasize, the product is getting better by slight degrees despite lower costs in hundreds of small ways but you actually wouldn't notice explicitly, but that you would appreciate subconsciously.
But getting those costs down, variable costs and fixed costs, is what allows us to lower the price and be financially sustainable and achieve our mission of environmental sustainability.
So we have to be absolute zealots about this.
There's no question.
"
1653,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Absolutely.
I mean, we're confident that our CAPEX per unit of production for Shanghai factory and for Model Y will be less than half of what we did for Model 3.
Internally, we think it might be a quarter but that's probably too good to believe, but it's definitely less than half.
"
1654,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"I think it seems good.
I mean, our share actually with Europe and China is, how do we get the cars made and on a boat as such that it reaches customers before end of quarter and we don't have a massive number of cars on the water.
That's our biggest challenge.
It's not demand.
It's how do we get the cars there fast enough.
"
1655,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Yes, absolutely.
"
1656,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"The -- and we're not even really trying, I should point out.
I guess it's -- we -- our factory is like, right now, only making cars for China and Europe.
That's all it's doing for -- with respect to Model 3.
And our whole focus is, OK, how do we get those cars made, get them on a ship as fast as possible, get the ship as fast as possible to Zeebrugge in Belgium then get them over to Drammen in Norway and get those cars to customers as fast as possible.
We get them to China as fast as possible.
In China, we were also -- yes, we don't what's going to happen with the trade negotiations.
So that's very important to get those cars especially to China as soon as possible.
We hope the trade negotiations go well, but it's not clear.
But we need to get them there while there's sort of a de facto -- sort of a truce on the tariff war.
And the demand gen is really not one of the things we're thinking about.
"
1657,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"So, Deepak, do you want to...
"
1658,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"Reservations are just like preorders.
It's like here -- like some video game come out and there's like a preorder number, then that's like -- stops being important once you start shipping the game or product.
So yes, as I said earlier, I think -- my guess is demand is somewhere on the order -- in a strong economy is on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year for Model 3 and even in a recession is probably on the order of 0.5 million.
"
1659,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Well, like I said, we're thinking about demand almost 0 right now.
It's really getting the product there in time and not having a ton of cars on the water and in a quarter and then for China getting cars there before there's a potential rise in tariffs.
That's really -- put really at front of mind that cost reduction and then improving service in North America, and -- yes.
"
1660,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,21,"I think it will be quite a significant advantage, a really good -- it's quite fundamental to the future of Tesla, and I expect to make several trips to China this year.
And I'm working very closely with the team building the factory.
I literally get daily updates.
So, it's a super big deal and we're only just talking about Phase 1 here.
Phase 1 is about 10% of what we think the Gigafactory will ultimately be.
So, it's a major, major, major deal.
And we're getting a lot of support from the Shanghai government, which we're very appreciative of, and the national government.
"
1661,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,22,"Yes.
That's true.
"
1662,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Sure.
We have -- we already have full self-driving capability on highway.
So from highway on ramp to highway exit, including passing cars and going from one highway interchange to another, full self-driving capability is there.
In a few weeks, we'll be pushing update that will allow the option of removing stock confirmed in markets where regulators approve it, which we think that will be the case in the U.S., for example.
And over time, we think probably all regulators will approve it.
But we kept talking from there just to make sure that we took care of like -- of any strange corner cases.
And it's really quite sublime if you have stock confirm of and like the car goes from highway on ramp, passes slower cars, change -- takes an interchange and then takes the exit and then comes to a stop after the exit.
So that it's really quite profound to have that experience.
And the next part of full self-driving will really be to -- is traffic lights.
It's hard.
So stop streets are pretty easy because you can essentially geocode those and is recognized at all times.
Traffic lights and intersections will be the next really tricky one, and then navigating complex parking lots and like -- so like if you're underground in a mall parking lot with a lot of traffic and pedestrians and it's on multiple levels, that kind of thing is when things get tricky.
With the release of enhanced or advanced Summon, you'll see the first indications of the car being able to navigate complex parking lots.
And that's also coming up fairly soon, probably next month.
And in development mode, the car does all of the things that I just mentioned in development mode.
It recognizes traffic lights and stop signs and you can -- basically has all the functionality in development mode.
It's really just a question of getting the reliability of recognizing traffic lights to several names.
So it's maybe like, I don't know, 98% good right now, but we need it to be like 99.999%, really extremely reliable.
So I mean [Inaudible] I think the capability will be there for -- when will we think it's safe for full self-driving? It's probably toward the end of this year, and then it's up to regulators to decide when they want to approve that.
"
1663,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Well, the -- I think it's important to bear in mind is because of electricity is quite a bit less than the cost of gasoline, especially in Europe or in California or China, basically almost everywhere except, say, the middle of the United States, where the cost of gasoline is very expensive and electricity is far cheaper.
The -- so that factors in to the cost of ownership pretty significantly.
It's on -- sort of going on the order of $50 to $100 a month depending upon how much somebody drives.
So that's a very important thing to consider for an electric car versus a gasoline car.
The -- that said, in terms of initial cost of acquisition, I think it's probably -- this is just off the top of my head, not a calculated number, probably on the order of 7k but trending toward 4k or 5k.
It's off the top of my head.
"
1664,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,25,"My guess is it ends up being sort of about the six and one-half [Inaudible] where if there's a given amount of free cash flow, you sort of decide-you decide to achieve that with a smaller production or smaller volume of cars or at a higher margin or large volume cars at a smaller margin.
I think we're already toward the second.
We'd rather make more cars at a lower margin, but I think it's more or less a flat rate.
"
1665,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,26,"That's a highly proprietary number.
We cannot give it out, but I'd like to tell you but no.
We do think we have the best costs in the world.
We're -- to the best of our knowledge, our costs are lower than anyone else right now and they're improving.
"
1666,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,27,"I spoke directly with Tsuga-san about this, the Head of Panasonic, and he assured me this will have no impact on Tesla.
"
1667,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,28,"Well, we've been reluctant to introduce the leasing on Model 3 because of how -- of its effect on GAAP financials.
So, it is worth noting that demand to date is with 0 leasing.
So obviously, leasing is a way to improve demand but it has -- it makes our financials looks worse.
So we're -- we don't want to introduce that right away.
I mean, we'll introduce it sometime later this year probably.
What -- I'm not sure the percentage of lease is for S and X right now.
"
1668,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,29,"Yes, exactly.
Our leases are legit.
The -- it usually expects a small business.
Tax write-off is important for the -- for leasing.
"
1669,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,30,"No, it's actually -- we've just been very silly about where we store our parts.
So, it's actually going to be no change in sort of working capital or not something you would even notice in the financials.
It's just being smarter about sending parts directly to service centers.
In fact either directly from our factory here or from our suppliers and just ship and direct to the service center.
Right now, actually, our costs will improve, I think, actually quite a lot, because there's been -- actually quite -- they're kind of persistent.
It's quite boneheaded, actually speaking self-referentially.
So just being -- so stopping doing the foolish things will massively improve our service costs, will massively improve customer happiness around the world, and it's just fundamentally better all around.
I mean, there are some pretty -- we've been just like super dumb in some of the things we've done, where -- like in one of my trips to China last year, as I always ask, ""OK, what are we doing wrong? What can we fix?"" And then like our China team is great always.
They're like, ""Well, do you think we could have spare parts that are made in China just sent directly to China service centers? Because currently, there's a bunch of parts that are made in China then sent to a warehouse in New Jersey and then sent back to China."" Literally, what was happening.
It's super nut stuff.
So, it's going to get way better.
And yes, it's very queer.
"
1670,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,31,"Yes.
J.B., is there anything...
"
1671,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,32,"I mean, our internal projections for stationary storage are closer to 3 gigawatt hours.
But some of it is kind of lumpy and may not be completed this year.
We would have done more in stationary storage last year except we were cell-starved for vehicle production.
So we had to convert a bunch of stationary storage lines, battery lines, to vehicle battery lines.
Otherwise, we would have done quite a bit more in stationary storage.
I expect that to grow, I mean, probably twice as fast as automotive for short -- a long time.
"
1672,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,33,"It's going to be a gigantic business down the road.
"
1673,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,34,"We have no plans to switch S and X to 2170, and can't comment on huge product developments.
"
1674,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,35,"Sure.
I mean, I do think that the economy moves in cycles and there's fairly a significant risk of a recession over the next 12 to 18 months, but I'm confident that Tesla will remain at least slightly profitable even with -- even if there is a significant recession.
And then when -- and be all the stronger for it when there's recession.
And the -- we have to be relentless about cost in order to make affordable cars and not go back up.
That's what our headcount reduction is about, yes, yes.
I think we have to -- it's -- we have to be super hardcore about it.
It's the only way to make affordable cars.
The -- on the SpaceX side, the cost reduction was for a different reason unrelated to -- it was --SpaceX has really -- SpaceX has two absolutely insane projects that would normally bankrupt a company, Starship and Starlink.
And so SpaceX has to be incredibly spartan with expenditures until those programs reach fruition.
"
1675,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,36,"Yes.
So let's see.
The -- so Deepak is -- well, I'd like you to make the announcement, but Deepak is going to be retiring.
"
1676,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,37,"Yes, from Tesla.
"
1677,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,38,"Deepak, I think it's now been -- you first started with Tesla about 11 years ago, right?
"
1678,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,39,"Yes, almost 11 years.
Thank you for your tremendous contribution to Tesla.
And he's announcing retirement but the retirement will not be immediate, but Deepak will continue to be at Tesla for a few more months and will continue to serve as a senior advisor to Tesla for probably years to come hopefully.
And we thought long and hard about who the right person is to take over from Deepak, and that's Zach.
And Zach has been with Tesla now for nine years...
"
1679,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,40,"Yes.
So Zach, you had management and technology at Wharton undergrad and then worked at Tesla and then spent a couple of years at Harvard Business School, which I actually don't think was necessary, by the way.
"
1680,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,41,"Yes, exactly.
So Zach's incredibly talented, has made a huge contribution to Tesla over the years, and obviously a very well-known quality to the whole team and has the respect of the whole team.
And Zach, I don't know if you'd like to say a few words?
"
1681,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,42,"OK.
Or do you want, Deepak, to save you?
"
1682,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,43,"Great.
"
1683,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,44,"Thanks, guys.

"
1684,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,45,"As I mentioned earlier, the Model Y, we think, most likely will be produced at Gigafactory, but that's -- unless we encounter some obstacle -- that's the default plan that we're proceeding toward.
And it's fast, low risk, and relatively low CAPEX.
In terms of the -- I mean, probably there's like initial production of Model Y and probably low volume, probably next year.
But then it always takes time to ramp up any production system, and that's difficult to predict, the shape of that S-curve.
So we feel confident in saying there will be production volume of Model Y by the end of next year, but in between beginning of next year with low volume, it always starts with very low and then it grows exponentially -- from beginning of last year to end of next year, it's difficult to break that ramp.
So that's our expectation for Y.
For Semi, we're -- I don't know if you want to comment on that, Jerome.

"
1687,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,48,"Yes, that's good.
And then the Tesla pickup truck, we might be ready to unveil that this summer.
It will be something quite unique, unlike anything else.
"
1688,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,49,"Yes.
I mean, as a ballpark figure, probably it's something about -- something in the order of $0.5 billion in CAPEX to get to the 3,000 vehicle rates in Shanghai, ballpark figure.
And as Deepak was saying, [Inaudible] very competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compelling interest rates, and we do not expect that to be a capital drain on the company.
"
1689,TSLA,2018,4,elon-musk,co-founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,50,"Sorry perhaps -- if you're in the automotive industry you'll understand how significant this is but maybe it's not as obvious to everyone is Tesla has the first wholly owned manufacturing facility in China for any -- of any automotive company.
So this is profound, and we're very appreciative of the Chinese government allowing us to do this.
I think it is symbolic of they wanting to open the market.
And if I -- and [Inaudible] to everyone, I would just like say a note of appreciation for the Chinese government in allowing us to do that.
It's a very significant thing.

The hardware 3 design is continuing to move along.
Over the last quarter, we've completed qualification of the silicon, qualification of the board.
We started manufacturing line and qualification of the manufacturing line.
We've been validating the provisioning close in the factory.
We built test versions of Model S/X and 3 in the factory to validate all the finish of the parts and all the processing flows.
So, we saw a lot of work to do and the team is doing a great job and we're still on track to have it ready to go by the end of Q1.

I guess just along those lines, you indicated that you're going to bring Model 3 to Europe early next year.
Where would you like to see production in order to support that ramp overseas?
"
1696,TSLA,2018,3,romit-shah,nomura-instinet,True,1,"Sorry, I meant to ask, where would you like to see that production rate on a weekly basis go to in order to support that ramp?
"
1697,TSLA,2018,3,romit-shah,nomura-instinet,True,2,"And you have to add new lines to support that or are you just going to continue to remove bottlenecks on the existing lines?

1698,TSLA,2018,3,romit-shah,nomura-instinet,True,3,"Okay, thank you.
And then just as a follow-up, in the letter you do point out the size of the European market for premium mid-size sedans is roughly twice that of the US.
Could you also maybe just comment to what your expectations often makes in Europe based of Model S and Model X, do you expect a richer mix in Europe versus the US or is it fairly for EMEA?

So I've done the analysis of all the tradings that we've received and really the only pattern that I have seen is that, it's sort all across the board and the vast majority is non-premium brands.
I think that is the number one message is just that more than half of the tradings we received were priced at below 35,000 were new.
But other than that, there is no real pattern, I haven't -- always anything toward highlighting other than is just a lot of people upgrading their cars quite dramatically.

1711,TSLA,2018,3,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,8,"Yeah, so at the moment if you look at for example for Q3 all electric vehicles made around the world, their total battery capacity was about 20 or 19 gigawatt hours.
And we -- what we produced in Q3 was about the same or a little bit higher, its about half of world's batteries basically.
"
1712,TSLA,2018,3,martin-viecha,senior-director-of-investor-relations,False,9,"So, yeah, just the giga itself is about 20 and on top of that Tesla makes is, I don't know another four or five.

All I'm aware of is that because of cold weather, probably all will drive and long battery range will be highly demanded in Europe, but apart from that, I mean, we ultimately have to start selling the car to see what the demand is.

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
"
1719,TSLA,2018,3,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,0,"Yes, thank you.
I have one for Deepak and then a follow-up please.
Deepak, the OpEx expense management was very strong in the quarter.
I think it was down 13% sequentially and OpEx was only up 5% year-over-year despite revenue growing 71%.
So on that front, I mean in hindsight did you get too bloated and needed to get more right sized? And looking forward how do we think about OpEx growth versus revenue growth on kind of a more normalized basis.
"
1720,TSLA,2018,3,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,1,"Okay.
And then so -- thank you for that.
And then to follow-up, I was just wondering if you could help us a little bit on the back to the gross margin on Model 3 and the $35,000 car.
So you know this quarter I impute that Model 3 a piece where maybe $59,000 and that might suggest that gross margins on a $35,000 Model 3 might be about zero.
And Elon, I think you alluded to the fact that you know the goal is really to get positive gross margins on a $35,000 car before shipping.
Are those all fair assessments and I guess the question is where is -- where would a $35,000 Model 3 be in terms of gross margins today? And where does it need to be before you want to operate broadly to consumers?
"
1721,TSLA,2018,3,toni-sacconaghi,bernstein,True,2,
1722,TSLA,2018,3,george-galliers,evercore,True,0,"Thank you.
Maybe just following-up on the previous question, is the target still to produce 10,000 Model 3's a week in Fremont.
And I think you mentioned in the past that once you got to run rate of around 5,000, you'd be better placed to assess what CapEx is required to get there.
So as of today, do you have a better idea of what CapEx is required to get to that kind of level at Fremont?
"
1723,TSLA,2018,3,george-galliers,evercore,True,1,
1724,TSLA,2018,3,dan-galves,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hey, thanks for taking my questions.
Congratulations on the quarter, it's really amazing to see this landmark quarter after covering the company for so long.
And thanks for bringing some of your team onto the call, it's very interesting.
My question is about cell supply.
There's been some noise about tight cell supply in sparks and tight labor supply, like in a short-term could you just talk about whether demand is outpacing supply of battery cells.
And kind of what's your plan for long-term expansion including cell supply in China?
"
1725,TSLA,2018,3,dan-galves,wolfe-research,True,1,"Got it.
That's a huge advantage, is there plans that you can talk about for cell supply in China? Will that be produced in China, I'm assuming so?
"
1726,TSLA,2018,3,dan-galves,wolfe-research,True,2,"Got it.
Okay, Thanks very much.
"
1727,TSLA,2018,3,dan-galves,wolfe-research,True,3,
1728,TSLA,2018,3,james-albertine,consumer-edge,True,0,"Great.
Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question.
Congratulations.
I want just a point of clarification, Elon you mentioned in August the time to get the car from factory to a customer was 30 days down to 20 at the end of the quarter, your goal is under 10 by the end 4Q.
Where do we see that flow through from a COGS perspective? Is that an automotive gross margin or is that in services and other at this point?
"
1729,TSLA,2018,3,james-albertine,consumer-edge,True,1,"Understood, and I appreciate that clarification, sort of just trying to get at even running a negative gross margin in services and other for several quarters now and wanted to get a sense for when that could maybe drop and start to turn a corner and to generate some profit for you, I understand there's a lot of building out going on for sales, service and charging infrastructure.
But if you could give us some kind of clarification there that would be I think helpful.
And if you're willing maybe to provide an update on where you stand today in terms of battery costs.
I know your goal sort of parity with ice vehicles, but maybe an update if you're willing to provide and where you stand in that trajectory? Thanks.
"
1730,TSLA,2018,3,james-albertine,consumer-edge,True,2,"Then on the battery cost and there was a question --
"
1731,TSLA,2018,3,james-albertine,consumer-edge,True,3,
1732,TSLA,2018,3,maynard-um,macquarie,True,0,"Hi, thank you.
Congratulations on a great turning point for Tesla.
As you continue to scale the business, can you talk about how we should think about -- how you balance profits versus reinvestment, you're targeting sustainable GAAP profitability and cash flow.
But I'm curious, if there's a level of GAAP profitability or GAAP operating margin or cash flow you want to hold and then take the excess to fund new growth or accelerate opportunities?
"
1733,TSLA,2018,3,maynard-um,macquarie,True,1,"Great.
And when you talk about Tesla having its own road sharing fleet or giving the people the ability to loan out their car like in B model, I'm curious if your long-term plan is to build a platform that's going to enable companies to write-up occasions to turn the car directly into an application.
And then can you also maybe just talk about that business model, is that should we be thinking more about like a revenue sharing model sort of like how Apple takes piece of revenue generated for applications from iPhones? Thanks.
"
1734,TSLA,2018,3,maynard-um,macquarie,True,2,"That's a good reason and if I can squeeze since I couldn't ask the first one, you could answer.
Do you think that the third quarter is a milestone Elon where you think Tesla becomes sustainably self funding and perhaps not in need of outside capital? Thanks.
"
1735,TSLA,2018,3,maynard-um,macquarie,True,3,
1736,TSLA,2018,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Hey, thank you for taking my questions.
I was very surprised in the numbers you reverted today by your gross margin performance on the model 3.
So, if I remember correctly you were expecting more than 15% gross margin for this quarter and you actually did better than 20%.
So, can you take us through what improved like faster and better than you had initially anticipated in the manufacturing line and where these improvements came from?
"
1737,TSLA,2018,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"Okay, thanks.
That's great.
And then on as a quick follow-up, you've announced although that we can like a mid range kWh is with a smaller battery pack.
And I was wondering as you're looking at expanding product channels modestly, I think about it as you had two options, one was to grow and to keep what you're seeing higher end, higher ASP kWh.
And the other one was to go for a lower cost car, and stick to the US.
So, how did you decide the sequencing of these two things? Why is the lower kWh now and going abroad early next year?
"
1738,TSLA,2018,3,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,
1739,TSLA,2018,3,jeffrey-b.-straubel,chief-technology-officer,False,0,"Sure, I can speak that.
This is JB.
We have had a period where the supply was fairly tight for Model 3, but it did not really constrain the Model 3 production in (multiple speakers) mybe for a few days.
The impact was larger, it felt on the energy products.
And that's still is somewhat tight, but we do as we pointed out in previous discussions, we do have third party supplies of energy cells.
So that production can continue even, even independently of the Panasonic supply in sparks, so that's been very helpful and that is expanding in future quarters.
And also the Panasonic supply is expanding.
The productivity of existing lines is continuing to improve, with a lot of hard work from the engineering teams and just operational stability.
And we continue to bring online new production lines.
So even just in the last several weeks, we've started off yet another self production line with Panasonic.
And through the end of the year, there's another line coming on and then one shortly after that.
So there's a steady increase in the total supply that should keep us ahead of even Model 3 growth and also should let us have a larger percentage of energy supply be sourced from giga locally.
"
1740,TSLA,2018,3,jeffrey-b.-straubel,chief-technology-officer,False,1,
1741,TSLA,2018,3,andrej-karpathy,director-of-ai-&-autopilot-vision,False,0,"Yeah, certainly.
Hi, everyone.
My name is Andrej Karpathy.
I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla.
And my team trends all the neural networks that analyze the images streaming in from all the cameras for the Autopilot.
For example, these neural networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so on.
The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the Autopilot computer, which Pete briefly talked about.
This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster, but more importantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger computationally more expensive networks to the fleet.
The reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry and that we see this as well is that as you make the networks bigger by adding more neurons, the accuracy of all their predictions increases with the added capacity.
So, in other words, we are currently at a place where we've trained large neural networks data work very well, but we are not able to deploy them to the fleet due to computational constraints.
So all of this will change with an acceleration of the hardware and it's a massive step improvement in the compute capability and the team is incredibly excited to get these networks out there.

1743,TSLA,2018,3,phil-lebeau,cnbc-tv,True,0,"Thank you, guys.
Elon, a quick question in terms of as the federal tax credit starts to be phased out, as your sales crossover the threshold, what kind of an impact have you guys modeled into, how much that might slow down potential sales?
"
1744,TSLA,2018,3,phil-lebeau,cnbc-tv,True,1,"But in terms of in the United States, do you expect that it will slow down demand and sales within the US?

1748,TSLA,2018,3,unidentified-speaker---,none,False,1,"Very minimal.
"
1749,TSLA,2018,3,unidentified-speaker---,none,False,2,"The price log is way beyond the federal tax credit, so clearly there is value that they are proceeding whether it's cost o ownership, whether its sustainability that is the brand and the safety, all of the above is making a large number of customers jump up significantly in their purchase price.
"
1750,TSLA,2018,3,unidentified-speaker---,none,False,3,"I'm just trying to -- in closing, Elon started with it and I wanted to say that from myself personally here.
I want to personally thank all the Tesla employees who have worked incredibly hard this quarter and in prior quarters in each and every part of our business.
Our results really are the a reflection of the execution done in the company -- by the company and the passion that our employees have to deliver such results despite all our odds.
And I also want to thank all our customers and all our investors who believed in us and our product and our vision of accelerating the world's transition to sustain latency.
So thank you from my side.

1751,TSLA,2018,3,unidentified-speaker---,none,False,4,
1752,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Deepak here and (inaudible) and others please feel free to join.
Our improvements on the cost side were in every aspect of cost.
So clearly our manufacturing labor hours improved significantly.
Our overall manufacturing costs dropped almost 30% sequentially Q2 to Q3.
We produce more volume, so we had better fixed cost absorption.
We had wireless craft, our yield on each of the lines across both factories improved significantly.
And as we look forward, we see even more opportunities.
We are going through this phase where we are now stabilizing production and the team can now intensely focus on cost optimization.
And that trend will just continue in Q4.
"
1753,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Our expectation was, we would do better, but we want to be conservative, you're right.
And in terms of our guidance that we gave for Q3.
"
1754,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"And from a broader sense you're looking at it as the cost of doing business, which can be avoided.
"
1755,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"I think over time every quarter impressively we will see an improvement in the service and other business, as our revenue continues to grow.
And as the size for fleet grows is as simple as that.
"
1756,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, and that also includes our used car sales.
And our used car sales has been hitting to go and they have a healthy margin.
And so that overall business for matured companies is in some cases more profitable than new products, I'm not just having brought OEMS, auto OEMs.
And we are at the early stage of our growth and as our fleet size grows there are just so many opportunities in that business that -- actual time as simply say.
"
1757,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Fantastic.
I think that's all we have time for today.
Sorry, go --
"
1758,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,6,
1759,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"No, I think you are totally -- we're reducing our raw material inventory on one hand by keeping production stable finding efficiencies in their house management and supply chain.
And at the same time, reducing the time to deliver the car and convert that car into a cash and that significantly improves working capital.
"
1760,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Reduce our inventory in Q3, which help -- we had higher payables because -- sorry higher receivables because the quarter ended on a weekend, we won't have that in Q4.
So all of this should continue to help us in Q4 and beyond the working capital gain.
"
1761,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah, Toni, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5% to just clarify that first of all.
And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employee headcount, how we benefited from that in Q3.
And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending.
The other piece that helped us is lot of our Model 3 spending on expense sort of R&D is reducing because Model 3 is going into production, so Q2 to Q3 we saw a reduction there.
And it just gives you the sense of the leverage of the expenses can have why the revenue is growing dramatically.
So our OpEx will increase in the future, but parse through a rate and we will continue to be really, really careful about the spending and I think there are actually more efficiencies that we can find.
"
1762,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"So we will continue down that path certainly.
"
1763,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Exactly and it's a matter of time, it's been a significant material cost reduction that comes with smaller battery packs or model service, it's not the same cells that we have in the existing cars, (multiple speakers).
"
1764,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"And we are achieving massive reduction in all our manufacturing cost for a car, which will continue and as volume grows that also helps us in the fixed cost itself.
And so it's same factors that have helped us so far, will continue to help us going forward to get us there.
"
1765,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"It's all in automotive gross margin, our logistics cost (multiple speakers).
"
1766,TSLA,2018,3,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"The interest expense of that -- that's is in interest expense line, that is not in COGS.
"
1767,TSLA,2018,3,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,0,"Okay.
This is Stuart Bowers.
We'll soon begin to roll out the team's most advanced Autopilot feature ever, Navigate on Autopilot.
In our last release, we launched a new set of neural networks that combine together, provide a view of everything happening around the car.
With Navigate on Autopilot, we use information to understand exactly where the car is on the highway system and to automatically change lanes, handle forks and take high-curvature exits to follow a Napf route.
Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car moves into an adjacent lane.
Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement they choose to.
One area that I'm personally really excited to build on this improvement is active safety.
With the advancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level of constant vigilance that humans just can't.
Ultimately, this will allow us to warn and even intervene for an enormous percentage of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as software accretes to our existing customers.
"
1768,TSLA,2018,3,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,1,"All the time.
"
1769,TSLA,2018,3,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,2,"Yeah, the team is on a incredible work here and by bringing up more of the cameras around the car, we can detect things as they come toward us, not just directly in front of us.
"
1770,TSLA,2018,3,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,3,
1771,TSLA,2018,3,laurie-shelby,"vice-president,-environment,-health-and-safety",False,0,"Yeah, thanks.
We have the safest cars made by the safest people.
So it's exciting time here at Tesla.
All car and manufacturing factories have injuries.
At Tesla, we have a commitment to zero injuries and our target is actually on good reporting.
So we have good reporting of injuries, good reporting of near misses, good observations and lots of improvement.
So to be the safest company in the world where we have to be committed to that and everybody here is.
So we're actually steadily getting there and we're not going to stop until we're there.
"
1772,TSLA,2018,3,laurie-shelby,"vice-president,-environment,-health-and-safety",False,1,"Correct, correct.
The factory here had a four months long collision investigation and it basically proves that we are recording properly and doing as we as we should be.
So it's much different than what you would read about in the press.
"
1773,TSLA,2018,3,laurie-shelby,"vice-president,-environment,-health-and-safety",False,2,"Yeah, yeah, I'm very proud of the team for that.
It's -- yeah one point I think people don't know is I've been here about a year now, time flies when you're having so much fun.
But when I joined we were already really a fraction -- our injury rate was a fraction of what it had been when Toyota and GM ran the factory in the new days.
So what we're all about is really continuing to make improvements from there.
And what's also important is not to have serious injury and that's extremely rare here at Tesla.
We have really strong focus on prevention and also using mitigating controls, so we see these types of injuries don't occur.
I mean most of the injuries that we have are muscular, sprains and things like that.
"
1774,TSLA,2018,3,laurie-shelby,"vice-president,-environment,-health-and-safety",False,3,"Exactly.
"
1775,TSLA,2018,3,laurie-shelby,"vice-president,-environment,-health-and-safety",False,4,"Yeah, hand and finger cut and sprain.
So, I kind of just want to break down a few things that my team is been working on along with all the leaders here.
You know first it's people and engagement.
So one of the first things is meeting with you, Elon, I meet you with on a regular basis.
We meet with all the production leaders.
So it's full-on engagement on improving safety.
We have built a really strong EHS team, the best and the brightest.
We have -- and our EHS team is actually embedded into the line on the factory because we learn the process, we may learn the people, you don't know how to improve unless you're out there on the line, on the process, engaging with the associates, listening and learning from our associates.
So we have really strong engagement health and safety committees.
We do find it, fix it locks or walker -- our leaders are out there walking and also looking for improvements.
And actually just this quarter, we had over 15,000 improvements, I mean that's like amazing.
So very, very exciting about that.
We also look at risk reductions in human performance.
People are going to make mistakes, so we're going to design in so we feel safely.
We have an early symptom intervention program, this is where we have industrial athletes go out on the line and work with our associates before anything happens.
Like if you have a pain, let's work it out, let's strengthen and really get our employees fit.
So we're doing that.
We've also just opened a new and improved health clinic.
So when injuries do occur, we get the absolute best care for our associates and it's actually overseen by one of California's leading orthopedic surgeons.
And we did that because most of our injuries like we said like 80%, 85% are those sprains and strains.
So now they get that best care here on site and we have 24/7 care.
We're actually staffed by three full-time doctors and nurses and I'm really super happy with the care they're giving and I think employees are as well.
And the third --
"
1776,TSLA,2018,3,laurie-shelby,"vice-president,-environment,-health-and-safety",False,5,"I know that's super exciting.
"
1777,TSLA,2018,3,laurie-shelby,"vice-president,-environment,-health-and-safety",False,6,"That's where we plan to go, exactly.
And then finally just being proactive because that's what we're about, innovation and proactive.
I mean we joined national safety organization.
We partner with many leading universities including California, Berkeley Center for Occupational and Environmental Health.
We do presentations there.
We work with the automotive industry and do bench-marking all the time.
We're always looking and bringing people in to look for things that we can do better, and for new technology and innovations and safety.
So and with all of that, we have made improvements in our injury rate.
We are more than 10% better year-over-year and our last workdays and our days away, but the most important thing is we're also getting all those good engagement observations they're moving up.
So injuries down, observations engagement up.
Thank you.

So I'll make some opening remarks, then we're going to talk about vehicle safety, Autopilot and Battery Safety and we have a number of people from Tesla here to elaborate on that.
I think there's just a lot going on that you would find interesting, but I want to start by thanking all of our customers, employees, and shareholders.
This was an incredibly historical quarter for Tesla, Model 3 production stabilized, we delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally, which is more than 80% of the vehicles that we delivered in all of 2017.
In fact, we delivered more cars in this quarter than we did in all of 2016, in a single quarter.
Model 3 became the best selling car in US in terms of revenue and the fifth best selling car in terms of volume.
We saw higher revenues and significantly better profitability in our energy business, in fact I think for solar it made them the best quarter ever for solar.
We achieved GAAP net income of over $300 million, increased cash and equivalents by $731 million and achieved a greater than 20% gross margin of Model 3.
Moreover, we expect to again have a positive net income and cash flow in Q4 and I believe our aspirations certainly will be for all quarters going forward.
I think we can actually be positive cash flow and profitable for all quarters going forward, leaving aside quarters where we may need to do a significant repayment, for example in Q1 next year, but I think even in Q1, I think we can be approximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter.
This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across the Board from sales, production, delivery, service, energy engineering finance and all of our G&A teams, really every part of the business executing incredibly well.
And when I think I want to gain probably incredibly hard work, especially I want to thank customers who helped -- it's like many of you haven't heard of this, maybe this has happened before, but I've never heard of it a case where a company's customers actually cared about the future of the company so much that they volunteered their time to help the company succeed.
I think that's amazing, just don't see that anywhere.
So, yeah, like really it makes choking out actually.
This quarter, we started rolling out Version 9.0 of our software which is the biggest software upgrade in three years and Model 3 received a 5-Star Safety Rating In Every Category and subcategory, they get less probability of injury of any car that the US government has ever tested.
Looking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3's in Q4.
And I expect that trend to continue into Q1 and we're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe and China early next year, given that the market for mid-size premium sedans in those regions is even larger than in North America.
I said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable.
This quarter was an important step toward that and I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead.
So this was, yeah, just a -- so proud of the Tesla team, our customers really appreciate the support of our long-term shareholders and yeah, just want to have -- I mean half of the Tesla team are super appreciative of your support, so it was actually -- been a very difficult time.
All right.
Now let's move to, start-up with vehicle safety.
Madan, who is our Lead Vehicle Safety Engineer been with company for a long time.
Madan, how many years you've been?
"
1780,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,1,"10 years? Wow.
So yeah, I've been working with Madan for 10 years.
We've had so many conversations on vehicle safety, wow, and we're really going to try to go the extra mile with vehicle safety, not just like there is a series of government mandated tests, but you know what some companies do is they game the system.
So they know where the side point impact is going to be, they strengthen right in that position.
At Tesla, we like, OK, what is the weakest point in the car, let us test with that position.
So the actual safety is not fully captured in the tests because we anti-game the system.
Madan, if you could?
"
1781,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,2,"Great.
And that will be roughly a 1000% increase in processing capability compared to the current hardware and so sounds good, a giant of crew despite being a bump, it costs about the same costs volume and car consumption are approximately the same as the current hardware, but it is a tenfold increment in frames per second and improved redundancy as well.
But very importantly, very important to emphasize is that, the only thing that needs to change between the cars used today and cars produced in the second quarter of next year is swapping up the autopilot computer.
And this is a simple change that takes less than half an hour and service to upgrade the computer.
And one will be able to upgrade their computer to full-self driving capability or upgrade their car to full-self driving capability with a simple service visit.
So, we expect all cars with the hardware to sensor suite, basically anything made in the last roughly two years will be upgradeable to full-self driving.
"
1782,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,3,"Right.
So, it's very important to emphasize that people shouldn't (inaudible) if you want to wait until that comes out, but there's no need to wait till it comes out because it's just a very simple plug-and-play change to get the full-self driving.
And anyone who is patron for self-driving option, we'll just get it done for free.
And anyone who saw once to order full-self driving at this point, it's just an off menu item, you can still order it.
But we took it off the order menu just because it was really creating a lot of friction in the sales process, and people didn't understand the difference between enhanced autopilot and full-self driving.
So, just to simplify the order process we switched that off and anyone who asks for it can certainly get it and it really ends up being a discount on future capability.
But to be clear, there's definitely no need to wait until Q2 to order a car.
We want to make just completely seamless process.
So, there's no advantage ordering now versus Q2.
Andrej, do you want to --
"
1783,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,4,"Great.
Thank you.
And actually I said this before when I -- I think soon but, better out in long-term future.
We absolutely see the future as kind of as sort of shared electric autonomy, so that you'd be able to do right handling or share the car anyway, you know sort of long-term model that's probably some combination of like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb, they will be Tesla dedicated cars for right handling and there will be -- and any customer will be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb.
So, its a combination of those two models, I think is pretty obviously where things are headed long-term.
The advantage that Tesla will have is that we'll have millions of cars in the field with full autonomy capability and no one else will have that.
So I think that, that puts us -- that will end up putting us in the strongest competitive position long-term.
And then Laurie, can you finish off with -- lets talk about factory safety and thank you for the hardwork of you and your team and I think we made great strides and yes, please go ahead.
"
1784,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,5,"Absolutely.
Yeah, so you can -- I mean actually like, for example we have like some, sort of for example like, we do get these like quite unfair acquisitions for example one of the most like that we are under reporting injuries and it's worth noting that OSHA completed their investigation and concluded that we have nothing to do anything of the sort.
"
1785,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,6,"Yeah, those are true.
"
1786,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,7,"Yes, it's essentially -- it's muscle strain and getting scratched.
"
1787,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,8,"But that's the most of the injuries here.
"
1788,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,9,"Yeah, we're going to expand on that, so the -- Tesla sort of health clinic both at three months and its sort of -- we have a really immediate first-class healthcare available right on the spot when people need it.
And this is not just for workplace, this is for workplace and non-workplace.
"
1789,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,10,"Yeah.
If (multiple speakers) if you come injured for any kind of reason then there is healthcare middle on the on-site.

1790,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,11,"Thanks Laurie.
We'll provide regular updates on what might there be and yeah our goal is unequivalently to have the safest factories in the world where people look forward to coming work in the morning.
So, its like, yeah that's our goal.
All right.
With that, we can move to questions.
"
1791,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,12,"I think potentially we have Newton on our side, and having Newton on your side is definitely the way to go.

1795,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,16,"Long-term it would be produced in China, short-term we're not certain of the short-term situation, but long-term certainly.
"
1796,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,17,"I think we're also being relatively -- on the conservative side when we predicted -- when we said like we're being --
"
1797,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,18,"Well, we're trying to provide most affordable electric car options that we can.
And so as we can -- we just don't have the ability to get to the $35,000 car right away.
We thought this might be a way to offer it as an intermediate step.
And that's really it.
We expect to start producing a significant volume for Europe in January, and obviously take some time to ship.
So deliveries, probably if we finish the deliveries in Europe kind of in the late February, March timeframe, because the people work in California to a customer in Europe.
And for us, our car only account as liberty, if it reaches the end customer and all the paperwork is completed correctly.
So it's the highest possible standard for considering a sale.
"
1798,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,19,"Yeah.
We may or may not deliver cars in APAC in Q1, but certainly in Q2.
It will be kind of borderline as whether our cars delivered in APAC by the end of Q1.
So I can't say for certain, they're definitely in Europe, but -- and then definitely in APAC in Q2.
"
1799,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,20,"Well, initially production will occur, I mean these last -- take several months of production is, vehicle production take place at our car plant in California.
"
1800,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,21,"You know, it's hard to predict with accuracy.
The -- and there's also to know like what the tariff for is and everything.
So long-term, I'd like to say like, we're not talking about like next quarter, so like what it is -- likely global demand for Model 3.
It's on probably on the order of anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year, I would say, good global demand for Model 3.
It looks to me like say the 3 series one that's around 0.5 million, the BMW 3 Series about 0.5 million a year globally.
And generally we find we have to compete the BMW 3 Series quite well.
So it seems like logical therefore that we would want to have a higher production or higher demand, they maybe somewhere between the kind of the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Golf, which is about a 1 million units a year.
So yeah, that's why I'd say anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million units long-term.
"
1801,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,22,"No, we definitely are going to do local production in China, we're moving rapidly on that.
So we're branding to have Model 3 production for the China market or the Greater China market active certainly in next year, it will all be happening next year, but it will be done with a very -- in a very capital efficient manner, much more akin to the way we did General Assembly line 4 versus General Assembly Line 3.
And then we'll also have a factory in China -- and in Europe long-term, because it's pretty silly to make cars in California and ship them all the way to Europe that's far.
Yeah, its interesting.
I'm not talking about S/X, I'm just talking about the 3.
So S/X will continued to be made in California, I think probably exclusively here before cars were trying to maximize affordability, it makes a lot of sense to produce those cars at least in the continent where they are consumed or more significant.
"
1802,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,23,"That is all the same.
"
1803,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,24,"I think we are not prepared to speak to that right now, except that it will be considerably less than money that we've spent to get to 5,000 in the first place, like I think quite dramatically less, I'd say like probably say passed like 7,000 units for Model 3 with really minimal CapEx.
"
1804,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,25,"Yeah, very minimal to get to 7,000 a week.
And then I mean that's really just basically solving improving our time of the existing lines, and we can do 7,000 a week.
So and then it gets a little harder as you start to go above 7,000, it would need -- at least bringing lines down in Fremont for significant upgrades to get to 10k.
But also just not -- we're not talking about massive amounts of CapEx.
But I would say like long term it's -- again long-term, it's something -- if we are thinking these are quarter-by-quarter basis, it's very difficult because when you have an exponential growth rate like we do, I mean, if you look at Tesla's cumulative deliveries over time, just like the cleanest exponential curve that I've ever seen.
So -- but small movements in calendar time can look like a very large hit or miss, one way the other, because it's such a steep curve, that's why it's very tricky to predict things on a quarterly basis, but a lot of user if you go out in a year or so.
Yeah, I mean, probably long-term it's -- as we serve 7,000 to 10,000 cars from Fremont of Model 3 and then kind of 5,000 to 8,000 in rest of world something like that, this is a guess.
"
1805,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,26,"So, yeah, I mean it seems like -- it's likely to be comparable to, its pretty (technical difficulty) like price in Europe then most likely to be at least as much the amount in Europe that's (inaudible) like that's pretty safe.
But I don't really estimate electric cars that everyone can afford not to sort of mine -- high option value cars, it's like -- if we could produce a $35,000 car today, we would do it.
We need more work, there is more work to do before to make $35,000 car and have it be positive gross margin, not we're probably less than six months from that, that's our mission.
"
1806,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,27,"Sure, I mean, maybe to if I characterize that question it would be like, are we stopping new vehicle development in order to achieve GAAP profitability and cash flow possible, will that be an accurate, is that essentially like, the answer is no.
So we've made significant progress on the ROI.
And so in fact I improved the prototype production recently, so it will be 2024 that's in volume production.
We made great progress there, also continue to make progress on the semi and the newer Tesla Roadster.
And then actually product them, of course, we are most excited about is that (inaudible), I think that's going to be the next level stuff there.
And then -- I should, I want to get mention the Solar Tower Roof, we're also start getting into volume production of the Solar Tower Roof next year.
That's quite a long development cycle, because many things it's roof its going to last 30 years.
So even if we do accelerate life testing as fast as possible, there is still minimal amount of time required to do that and there is lot of engineering that goes into how do you put on the Solar Tower Roof with and not be really labor intensive and things so.
So there's lot of engineering not just in the tail, but in the ways done.
And then we've got continued improvements in power vault, power pack other energy products.
I think we've got the most existing product roadmap of any company by far.
I'm not even sure like probably twice -- I don't even know who would have -- which company would have a better product roadmap or even close, yeah maybe you know, I don't know about that.
"
1807,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,28,"I don't know about turning cars in application exactly, I mean maybe or right ready to think that maximizes usefulness.
And so if there is a way think of where third parties can do something and that could make sense, but I do know for sure that has a well operated to own right handling or its own right handling service, compete directly with Uber and love to obviously.
And -- but then also have the ability for customers to offer their car add or subtract their cars to fleet.
So we're company owned fleet and the company owned fleet will just be where there aren't enough customer cars to be length out.
So if we find again a particular metro, they aren't customers who are owing to either a car to the shared fleet then that's where we will supplement with a Tesla own fleet.
So that's why it sorts of a combination of Uber being and Airbnb.
And then we charge something probably comparable to yeah to have that say the works or I don't know we charge 30% or something in order for somebody to add the cars to fleet.
I think that's like a pretty sensible way to go.
"
1808,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,29,"Actually, I restrict questions to operational topics.
"
1809,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,30,"For many people it is the most expensive car they have ever brought.
And so they are clearly demonstrating with their money that they -- they are willing to spend extra money to get a Tesla.
So like Tesla is a sense like mass market premium.
"
1810,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,31,"Yeah, I mean really I can say, honestly like the top reason to refer a friend by Tesla is going to keep your friend safe.
"
1811,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,32,"Yeah, that is our goal.
We do not intend to raise equity or debt, at least that's in our intention right now, you know that may change in the future, but the current operating plan is to pay-off our debt and not to refinance them but pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage for the company.
And actually almost to that one quite important thing as and this is quite helpful to have these sort of crisis situations with logistics for example.
As I dug into the inventory like basically finished product inventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it was quite expensive in lot of cases to get cars to customers.
This was something I didn't fully appreciate before and we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factory to receiving the check from the customer, being in the customers hand as quickly when we need to get the check when we give the car to the customers.
So getting car from factory to customers to get that to be as short as possible.
In August, the average time in North America to get a car from the factory to a customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long.
By the end of the quarter, we reduced it to around 20 days.
And our goal in Q4, so the goal and our promise -- but our goal is to get the average time of a car from factory to customer under 10 days.
This is a giant improvement in the capital efficiency of the company, because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of products per day -- cars per day.
So every day it requires 75000 -- $75 million worth of capital.
So every 10 days is $750 million.
And we -- obviously we have a loan from the bank that we can make use of, but the banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle which translates to about 70% of the price of the vehicle.
So and we've got this loan outstanding which effectively increase the the COGS of the car and then the lose the company to the tune of 30% or whatever it would be inventory of the finished goods intransitives.
So that this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in North America and then also improving dramatically the transit time to Europe and Asia and this is where we're like having local factories is actually very important for capital efficiency the overall system because I think over time we want to get to the time from a car going from factory to customer under seven days worldwide.
And then the terms that we have with from our suppliers are on average just over 60 days.
Now our cost inventory management also -- there is a lot of room for improvement there.
I think we probably cut that down to a few $100 million or so, two parts or something like that maybe $300 million of parts at the factory.
So then effectively what we are going to do is reverse the working capital requirements for company quite dramatically to the point where the faster we grow the more capital we have.
This is incredibly important for capital efficiency of the company.
it's 19 day, Deepak, is there anything you would like to?
"
1812,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,33,"Yeah, it's really quite dramatic.
So yes I think it sort of profoundly changes the financial effectiveness of Tesla.
"
1813,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,34,"Yeah, just withering that the safety extends to not just people in the car, but also pedestrians.
"
1814,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,35,"Yeah, I mean it occurs to me that even if the only thing like even if this was the only thing that has a different was to shorten the time from factory to the end customer.
In any given company that would -- compete all other companies over time it would not be a contest.
"
1815,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,36,"We are going to find them actually like --
"
1816,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,37,"Yeah.
I mean, it's -- I mean the sound with asking questions of that nature and details, it is a rapidly changing situation.
So like literally if you'd ask us in a month it would be different, another month it would be different.
There's no question we need to get to a point where we can sell a $35,000 car and where the full account or COGS of the car is let's say, on the order of $30,000 or slightly less than $30,000.
Like I think we would want to ideally get COGS of the car of that car under $30,000, that would be -- that's our goal, that's why we're pushing very hard to achieve.
"
1817,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,38,"And then the non-cell portion of the pack is also reduced.
With the current mid-range pack ir still has the -- basically about the same non-cell portion of the cost.

1818,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,39,"Anything you want to add JB?
"
1819,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,40,"Yeah, I think it's in introduction inbound, logistics is one of the airborne logistics.
Maybe question like for the debt that is carried for that period of time is that factored into COGS or is that --
"
1820,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,41,"Okay.
That's like I think the definition of COGS should probably be important to include anything that's directly driven by volume, essentially that affects the marginal cost of the vehicle.
So although that is not in -- officially in COGS, in my opinion probably should be, to take the ABL interest expense and by that, that will lead to the cost of car.
"
1821,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,42,"Yeah, just essentially cash already increases quite dramatically dilution or leverage outside of the ABL line improve slightly.
And then -- the effect of car also reduces, because you do not have the interest expense.
And if you have interest expense over 20 days versus 10 days, this is a big difference.
"
1822,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,43,"Yeah, long-term I'd expect service to be a significant revenue item and to be a positive margin contributor.
And it's going to be a function of our fleet size and (multiple speakers), yeah exactly we're under warranty, it is like a lot of surplus on warranty.
But as the warranty expires, so there is like non-warranty items then we expect service to positive gross margin.
"
1823,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,44,"That is the key sort of competitive metrics.
So I think it's safe to say, we're much better than anyone else, but refer not to give a precise number.
"
1824,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,45,"Yeah.
So, not having a big engine block in the front of the car is really helpful, so because if you -- if a car would hit a pedestrian, we'll get active safety next because the best thing is obviously not to hit car pedestrian, the fact that their (inaudible) can condense so far in is really helpful because it ends up being like sort of -- like a trampoline or like -- it has it -- you just end of an rock underneath us, that's very helpful.
So, it's helpful for pedestrian safety and for the safety of people in the car.
And then, you may feel how like head-on collision with another car, the extended sort of trouble zone of a Tesla Model S/X 03 is helpful to the people in the Tesla and the people in the other car, those aren't just people in the car.
"
1825,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,46,"We don't expect this to result in -- yes that's the the sales tax or the tax incentive in US grossed in half at the end of this quarter, but then we also start shipping to Europe, and as such to Asia.
And we certainly do not expect anything that would cause our productions drop a little let's say a minimum of 5000 cars a week.
"
1826,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,47,"I think that as we are able to offer lower cost versions of the car that we would expect demand to sustain in the US.
I want to be clear like that's not like we're holding back this lower cost version of the car intentionally.
Just like -- is there anything we can do to provide lower cost car now and that's where we came out with the depopulated long range pack, just like basically taking -- having long range pack with yourselves, like we really care about providing the customer with the most affordable car that we would possibly produce.
So that's our ability.
And if we could do this more pack now, we absolutely would, it's just going to take us -- going to -- these three months to get the production going and then you guys fill our production and that production is going to go to -- you are going to make packs, packs is going to vehicle factory, the cars are going to get delivered to customers.
So that's why customers probably see the small battery pack on the order of like March or something or February maybe, but something on that order.
"
1827,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,48,"One thing its due and trying and kind of like maybe points that are worth very mind, as our quarterly letter indicates, the Model 3 is the most efficient energy per mile electric vehicle out there, because it's got the best efficiency.
So, we got the best in terms of miles or kilometres per kilowatt hour.
And we also have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour.
This makes it very difficult for other companies to compete with Tesla because we own the most efficient car and the lowest cost batteries.
So, I do encourage our competitors to really make a huge investment and we've been saying that for a long time.
And then -- their only aim is competitive disadvantage because they didn't -- we try to help them as much as we could and they didn't want to take our help, so they can use a lot of patents for free and we're happy they can use our Supercharger network if they can just have an adapter for our connector or something.
We want to be as helpful as possible to the rest of the industry, but the fact of the matter is we made the investment in the Gigafactory and other companies didn't.
And we put a lot of effort into having extremely efficient cars over having -- having most efficient powertrains and the other companies didn't, but I'm sure they will have a time, but that's what us put us in quite a strong competitive position right now.

Not just sort of strength and where we know the test will happen and that kind of thing.
So, we're all in these cars, our friends are in these cars, family is in the car, so we care about safety, well actual, I think safety is boring, but not at Tesla.
So, thanks, Madan.
Thank you for your decade of hard work and the rest of who is in the safety team and with that, let's move on to Autopilot and guys can just give an update on sort of Autopilot software, AI and hardware, yeah.
"
1831,TSLA,2018,3,elon-r.-musk,"co-founder,-chairman,-chief-executive-officer-&-product-architect",False,52,"We have a lot of -- we see this whole time in the data, where the cloud will do an automatic braking event and save a pedestrian or another car from impact.

1834,TSLA,2018,3,madan-gopal,principal-safety-engineer,False,0,"(multiple speakers) 10 years.
"
1835,TSLA,2018,3,madan-gopal,principal-safety-engineer,False,1,"Thank you, Elon.
Just want to give you a very quick background about myself.
Like I said, joined Tesla 10 years, I'm extremely very happy to mention working with extraordinary set of very passionate and very hardworking individuals and that essentially shows in our product.
So that's very important for us and also important is our principal mission statement on safety because what you want to do is, safety has been -- is probably the important factor for our vehicle, it's not just for electric vehicle, any vehicle period and that's fundamentally differentiates us, so which essentially helps us to keep adding new features and new safety technology.
And that's very important and that shows in Model 3, latest things that we have.
Also the fact that we have electric vehicle, the design and architecture gives us a fundamental benefit for our traditional vehicles.
And that takes here for example whether you have a block-up engine in the front where we can work with using a pretty much open architecture in the front and the whole fact that you have all the electrical and high voltage and motors and all of that, almost below the centre gravity of the vehicle is a lowest probability of reduce the lower risk, that significantly benefit.
"
1836,TSLA,2018,3,madan-gopal,principal-safety-engineer,False,2,"Exactly.
So in the latest series of tests, I would like to specifically talk about Model 3, Nixon did a series of tests, actually four tests for one front, two side and one roll-over test.
And if you look at it, we have been calculating how can we distinguish within the five star.
There are so many vehicle that already gets five star, and if you look at within the five star (multiple speakers).
"
1837,TSLA,2018,3,madan-gopal,principal-safety-engineer,False,3,"Yeah, exactly.
So, if you look at there, the metrics we came out with which is a part of US and cap rating itself has a lowest probably of injury and Model 3 has the lowest.
And just to give you a context, there are total of 900-plus vehicles since 2011 which have been rated.
So, the fact that Model 3 is the best among all the 943 to be exact.
So, that speaks the volume and I'm very happy to say that Model 3 has achieved, we are not stopping right now.
What we would like to do is next is, how we can make use of the active safety and Autopilot features and make it even more improvement, so the next area that we're focusing on how to integrate active and passive safety, that's our next area of challenge to which we will improve for sure.
"
1838,TSLA,2018,3,madan-gopal,principal-safety-engineer,False,4,"Correct.
"
1839,TSLA,2018,3,madan-gopal,principal-safety-engineer,False,5,"I would like to add one item which is essentially how we look at the real-world safety, which has always been an important element for Elon.
So, if you look at the -- our block force we showed how we handle the centrefold impact in the frontal.
By the way, that's not part of NCAP rating, it is just to show we go over and above the NCAP rating to make sure it's real-world safety, that's very important for us.

And appreciate all the color you've been providing, wanted to dig a little bit deeper, though, in terms of capital spending plans.
Considering your growth you've identified in China with the Model Y, we believe also in the EU, it's been discussed a factory there.
How do you plan to fund all of this growth without going back to the capital markets to raise funds? And can you verify for us whether or not there is a notice from a regulator that would prevent you from raising outside capital? Thanks.
"
1842,TSLA,2018,2,james-albertine,consumer-edge-research,True,1,"Very good.

1844,TSLA,2018,2,romit-shah,nomura-instinet,True,0,"Yes.
Thanks very much.
I guess my question is for the autopilot team.
We've been looking forward to this fully autonomous coast-to-coast drive and, Elon, I think you sort of said on previous calls if I can paraphrase that the team has been focused on developing a full self-driving suite that would work basically on all different kinds of road conditions.
And I'm just curious, what's holding back that capability today to go coast to coast? And are we closer now that you strengthened the compute technology?
"
1845,TSLA,2018,2,romit-shah,nomura-instinet,True,1,"I don't know if you guys have shared what attach rates are for autopilot.
And just as my follow-up, I guess I'm curious what you can do to increase the number of cars that have that functionality.
It would seem like the effects of auto margins and cash flows could be pretty positive.
"
1846,TSLA,2018,2,romit-shah,nomura-instinet,True,2,"Thank you.

It was a fun project actually.
"
1850,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,2,"...the door handles.
I mean as much as possible...
"
1851,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,3,"Yeah, the motors, yeah, in the prototype, a lot of the cell technology but there are some changes and I'd rather not make that public.
Yeah, obviously it's going to be better than what we showed last year.
There is a lot of improvements, yeah.
"
1852,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,4,
1853,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,5,"So not only was it producing good results but a lot of people contributed from different engineering groups and had a lot of fun in the process.
We set out...
"
1854,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,6,"We just wanted to create an assembly line that would be very easy and very straightforward.
So, it's a straight line.
Very simple.
Car enters at one point and it's finished at the other end.
Very simple access on all sides.
Very simple tooling that we reused for most of ...
actually, nearly all of it is systems and tools that we discarded from previous SNX or for Model 3.
"
1855,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,7,"And we amplified, repurposed them, make them sturdy for what was needed.
And...
"
1856,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,8,"Gravity helped.
"
1857,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,9,"Yeah, it's pushing the car.
"
1858,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,10,"No.
And something that I'm particularly happy about is that we installed the quality team at the end of the line and we wanted to have at least as high standards on this new line as in the other one, because it is so simple and straightforward, they can run very quickly to any point in the line if there is any potential concern and address very quickly.
There is no maze to move around or identify where something happened.
And the quality of the cars that come out of this structure is at least as good and we make all the performance cars on this particular line and they seem to be doing quite well.
So, this is a very pleasant surprise and the associates seems to be very happy and engaged in that particular area.
So, this may be a model of how we may want to start general assembly for future vehicles, at least start and we can always add further automation and complexity.

"
1860,TSLA,2018,2,jerome-guillen,vice-president-of-trucks,False,12,"Well, I mean you can already see in the prototype that we've leveraged a lot of the Model 3 components, the screens...
"
1861,TSLA,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
First, there's so much love and respect for colleagues and Wall Street analysts on this call, it's almost ...
it is lifting my spirits.
What can I say? I've got two questions.
The first is for the autopilot team.
There's an argument that a fully autonomous car is essentially like a terminator that is programmed to save lives in highly complex terrestrial environments and that this same technology with a few tweaks has some pretty obvious military capability.
Do you see any risk that U.S.
companies will ultimately not be allowed to operate weapons-grade AI-based technology in a market like China and vice versa?
"
1862,TSLA,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"So you don't see autonomous cars as a potential germination or training grounds for things that would have a national security or military interest? OK.
Maybe a follow-up, Elon, and my last question, who do you think would be a more formidable competitor over time, BMW or Amazon?
"
1863,TSLA,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"For Tesla.

1883,TSLA,2018,2,toni-sacconaghi,sanford-c.-bernstein,True,0,"Yes.
Thank you.
I have one question and one follow-up, please.
First, just on gross margins, it looks like S & X gross margins were up maybe 500 basis points sequentially and I'm wondering maybe you can articulate what drove that.
And then, more importantly, it looks like you're calling for Model 3 gross margins to go from about maybe 3% this quarter to 15% next quarter.
That's about a $6,000 cost out per car, and I'm wondering if you can maybe help us understand what sort of the forces that drive that kind of improvement in a relatively short time frame.

1888,TSLA,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good afternoon.
Just a first question.
Is it fair to assume the GA4 in the tent is now essentially permanent? And if so, is this potentially a new model for capacity and capacity additions that might be much more capital efficient over time?
"
1889,TSLA,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"I mean, is that replication of that simplicity why you think Shanghai could be that much less costly and that then Model Y capacity might be that much less costly to add?
"
1890,TSLA,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"OK.
If I can sneak in one quick follow-up? I mean, when we look at the grosses on the Model 3, you're saying 15% in 3Q, 20% in 4Q and I think the ultimate target is 25%.
I mean, what are the average transaction prices you guys are assuming? I mean, it sounds like they are going to be bit higher earlier but is that 25% gross ultimately still built around the low-40,000 ATP?
"
1891,TSLA,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,"OK.
"
1892,TSLA,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,4,"Great.
Thank you very much.

1894,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,0,"Yeah, I'd agree with all that.
We found a surprising number of ways to improve efficiency and speed and density as well at Gigafactory 1, and all those lessons will absolutely be shared with Gigafactory 3.
The teams are already, of course, beginning to collaborate and start to figure out ways to do this more efficiently and with less capex than last time.
Yeah.
"
1895,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,1,"I mean, there are so many specific examples but even in just recent weeks and months, we found some ...
certain areas of production that have been very capital intensive that we've been able to speed up with almost no additional capex by maybe 20%, even 25% or 30%.
"
1896,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,2,"Making it a lot simpler.
"
1897,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,3,"Maybe one other point, just to follow up quickly.
I think some people have taken this like a walk back from automation, which is not really accurate.
"
1898,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,4,"This is basically, I mean, a more thoughtful and focused way to apply automation to the actual issues that matter most.
"
1899,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,5,"Yeah, it's not an overall reduction in automation.
It is a focusing of our efforts automating the processes and the value-add processes that matter the most and I think we got maybe a little bit distracted on this first round automating a lot of things that added complexity that didn't necessarily speed up.
And...
"
1900,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,6,"And we can save...
"
1901,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,7,"But it's not like we're referring to the dark ages of all manual everything.
That's not at all the case.
"
1902,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,8,"Massively automated.
"
1903,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,9,"We also don't really I think differentiate it quite the way maybe you're implying.
I mean, technology and manufacturing are sort of one and the same in many cases and we're treating a lot of the manufacturing problems as a technology problem.
"
1904,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,10,"And applying our design teams, our technology teams, if you want to call them that, to solving those issues.
So I think the learning curves in some ways are quite similar.
"
1905,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,11,"I think maybe one other lesson learned is that it's obviously not the best approach or best efficiency to outsource some of that development.
"
1906,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,12,"Yeah, just by challenging some of the initial assumptions, the specifications, tweaking the controls and software.
"
1907,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,13,"Some of the areas that we struggled the most through the Model 3 ramp were those where we had perhaps less visibility and less control, and less direct kind of skin in the game on how those production lines were designed and built.
"
1908,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,14,"So that learning curve often involves Tesla coming directly in, understanding the process intimately, simplifying it, and then essentially doing our own design or changes to the lines that were built.
I think that's a key learning point that we've taken and I think the way that we can do this a lot more efficiently in the future is doing that approach from the start.
"
1909,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,15,"We did this somewhat the first time around but now there's I think even more exciting understanding of the value of having those ...
as Elon said, having the design engineers just working intimately with automation and line engineers, simplifying the process as they're designing the product.
"
1910,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,16,"I think so.
Yeah, I think we can do over half a million vehicles ...
actually probably more like 600,000 vehicles with current Giga and Fremont, and so they could throw 100,000, 200,000, maybe more, couple hundred thousand from Shanghai.
We're probably going to be more than 600,000 with Fremont and Giga, Nevada.
That's why I think maybe it's not ...
I think we have a shot at a million but somewhere 700,000, 800,000 seems pretty likely given the current what we know today.
"
1911,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,17,"I should say we are hoping to identify a Gigafactory location in Europe before the end of this year.
It's not for sure but we are hoping to do that before the end of the year.
"
1912,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,18,"Yeah, you kind of mentioned only 1 gigawatt hour but that's a big number in that business.
And that's maybe on the order of 300% what we did the prior year and we're still aiming at maybe another 3 times to 4 times growth for 2019.
"
1913,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,19,"Crazy growth rate.
"
1914,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,20,"No offense to software.
"
1915,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,21,"Maybe specifically also your cell ...
to the cell-limitation question.
I think this has been mentioned before but we also do use some other vendors.
"
1916,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,22,"[Inaudible].
"
1917,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,23,"And that's with basically zero capex.
"
1918,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,24,"Exactly, in our energy products.
So I've heard people feel like this is kind of a zero-sum game or something with Model 3 but that is not the case.
And we do...
"
1919,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,25,"And that PG&E project you mentioned is an incredibly exciting one.
It kind of is indicative...
"
1920,TSLA,2018,2,jb-straubel,chief-technical-officer,False,26,"...of the growth rate.

And I think that's a lesson that we're taking to heart broadly across other things that we're going to do in the future and it's an efficient way to scale up.

Our next question comes from Zachary Shahan with CleanTechnica.

1942,TSLA,2018,2,tim-higgins,wall-street-journal,True,8,
1943,TSLA,2018,2,robin-ren,head-of-sales,False,0,"Yeah.
So, starting from end of June when we opened the configurator and invited existing reservation orders, we saw tremendous excitement and response from our customers.
As Deepak just mentioned, we actually see more orders for the All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor car and performance cars combined than the rear wheel drives.
"
1944,TSLA,2018,2,robin-ren,head-of-sales,False,1,"Correct.
Another thing I want to point out is that we are actually ...
since we opened the configurator to the general public in early July, we are seeing an increased demand coming from people who do not currently hold a reservation.
I think that's something that we found super exciting, because these are the people who actually had no idea about Model 3 and they heard about Model 3 is available to order, many of them requested test drives and since early July, we have over 60,000 test drive requests in the U.S.
alone and these people come into our stores, do the test drive, and they become super excited and they decide to order the car.
So, we believe that the strong demand coming from especially the non-reservation orders is going to dramatically increase as we increase our test drive population.
To give you an example, three weeks ago, we had only eight stores having test drive cars to Elon's point earlier.
Now we have over 90 stores having test drive cars.
"
1945,TSLA,2018,2,robin-ren,head-of-sales,False,2,"Yeah, this is very interesting.
So, we looked at what people who are buying Model 3 cars in the United States, what cars they are trading in.
What we found is through this year, from January to July, the top five non-Tesla cars people are trading in to get into a Model 3, they are Toyota Prius, BMW 3 Series, Honda Accord, Honda Civic, and Nissan Leaf.
"
1946,TSLA,2018,2,robin-ren,head-of-sales,False,3,"Yeah.
They are surprising because they are not the traditional premium sedans.
They are actually ...
many of them are mainstream midsized sedans.

1948,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,0,"Hi.
Thank you for joining.
First of all, I'd like to say we're incredibly proud of the Tesla team for producing 7,000 Model 3, Model S, and Model X vehicles in the last week of June.
It was an amazing effort.
It's an honor to work with such a great team to produce that incredible result.
It's like mind-blowing.
We continued to achieve 5,000 Model 3s per week, or 7,000 combined S, X, and 3, multiple weeks in July, showing that, so we're able to do this on a sustained basis.
And we expect to, in the absence of a force majeure or some very unexpected event, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 Model 3s or above for Q3 and 2,000 Model S, Xs or above per week for Q3 as well.
So essentially, 7,000 cars a week-plus on average for Q3.
That's an amazing jump from only a year ago.
We were producing 2,000 vehicles a week.
It's really kind of a mind-blowing leap forward for a manufacturing company.
So, yeah, just incredible work by the team to do that.
Many, many late nights, weekends, extreme amounts of effort and lots of smart ideas.
It's amazing.
One of the results you're seeing is that the Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium midsized sedans combined.
So Model 3 market share is now a majority, in July, it was a majority of all premium sedans.
That trend is, we think, likely to continue.
We do not think it will stop there.
I have Robin Ren here, who is our worldwide head of sales, to talk about some of the interesting elements that we're seeing in terms of cars that people are trading in, the sales and demand trends.
It's looking really positive.
We're also getting great feedback on Model 3 from our customers, and we're now delivering the performance, dual-motor, and all-wheel-drive versions, and the Model 3 reviews are outstanding.
Really couldn't ask for better reviews from some of the toughest critics in the world.
Yeah, the thing that we're really proud of is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's actually causing parallel growth of our sales.
So, we deliver a Model 3 to somebody, they love it, they tell all their friends.
Really our customers are our primary sales force.
They love their car and take their friends for a drive and that's the thing that fundamentally drives our sales, but not everyone has a brand-new [Inaudible] Model 3 obviously, so we need to get the cars out there for test drives.
As it is right now, not even all stores in North America have Model 3 for test drives.
We prioritize getting cars to customers but we're soon going to have Model 3s available for test drives in all stores in both the performance version and the rear-wheel-drive version.
So because a lot of people, they will not buy a car until they test drive it, which is not unreasonable.
Although on Sunday when I delivered a -- we're testing out like direct delivery, which I think is definitely the future, direct delivery from factory to customer's home or work or wherever they are -- the guy who bought it had never actually even sat in a Model 3.
I was like, ""Wow, OK."" I asked him, ""Well, how do you feel about the car now that you have it and you've driven it?"" He's like, ""I love it.
It's amazing."" So, yes.
It seems to be really well-received.
So, at a production rate of 7,000 cars a week, we believe we can be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards.
We're going to try to raise that rate of the Model 3 production steadily in the coming quarters and try to get to the 10,000-cars-a-week number as soon as we can.
As we spent a lot of time debugging a wide range of manufacturing issues that the potential for our existing lines to be able to produce far more cars is much greater than expected.
That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by, in some cases, everything's being done manual instead of automatic, and in other cases, having be done automatic instead of manual, we've been able to achieve dramatic improvements to the output of existing lines, which means that our capex growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is a tiny fraction [Inaudible].
Capex growing from 5,000 to 10,000 is a tiny fraction of the capex needed to grow from 0 to 5,000 Model 3s.
This is, I think, very good news for capital efficiency of the company.
And with [Inaudible], that it's going to inform future mass market vehicles that we produce.
And from an operating-plant standpoint, from Q3 onwards, I really want to emphasize our goal is to be profitable and cash-flow positive for every quarter, going forward.
Now obviously, if there's a big recession or there's a severe force majeure event that interrupts the supply chain, that's not always possible but we're confident that in, provided the economy is roughly where it is today or reasonably good and there's not a big force majeure event that I feel comfortable achieving a GAAP income positive and cash-flow positive quarter every quarter from here on out.
There may be occasional quarters, where we pay back a big loan or something, where there may be just because we paid back a big loan but absent that, it would be cash-flow positive.
So, once again, I want to thank the Tesla team for their incredible work and our customers for their support.
Without the great people we have at Tesla and the customers who put their faith in us by buying our product, we would not be here today and, yeah, really never been more excited about the future of Tesla.
We've got super exciting set of products to bring out in the future.
And, yeah, I mean, sorry if I sound a little tired.
I've been working like crazy in the body shop lately but it's really going great, super excited.
It's like, yeah, some good people.
And a number of the executive team here, [Inaudible] asked the three key leaders of the Tesla autopilot team to be here.
So, I think to go from here to see if autopilot leaders of Tesla could introduce themselves and say a bit about what you're working on, what you're excited about in the future.
Sorry if I put you guys on the spot or anything.
I think we're making pretty radical advances in the core software technology and the division beyond that.
And then very importantly with the Tesla self-driving chip technology that we've been working on for three years is finally coming to fruition.
Pete Bannon is going to talk a lot about that but it's a plug-in replacement for the existing computer and enables an order of magnitude improvements in operations per second or frames per second as a way to think about it.
And we think this is really the key to Tesla full vehicle autonomy.
And [Inaudible] easy to replace.
I'll let Pete talk about that.
So, let me start off like Stuart, Andrej, and then Pete.

We try to anticipate ...
actually, we try and anticipate the questions that are on people's minds, that's why we have the autopilot [Inaudible] autopilot team here and much of the executive team of Tesla here to try to be proactive in that regard.

1960,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,12,"Yeah, being cash flow positive and capping at positive doesn't mean like ...
doesn't mean we're rolling in money.
There's definitely going to be cases where we're just barely cash flow positive or barely profitable in some quarters in the future but I think it's been a long time, almost 15 years now.
I think we're at a scale where the amount of time that it takes to actually scale up and do things is ...
there's a certain ...
like we're big enough, where we actually can spend money efficiently to make things go faster.
So we kind of hit scale with volume production of cars.
And I think we can ...
I think this is probably the right thing to do is to be sort of essentially self-funding on a go forward basis and apart from selective situations where there's say some debt ...
temporary debt for construction of a Gigafactory in China or Europe or something like that but apart from that, I think we ...
essentially like I don't think we're constraining growth in any significant way by adopting this strategy at this point.

"
1966,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,18,"Sure.
And I would also like to apologize for being impolite on the last call with you.
It's not right, and hope you accept my apologies.
"
1967,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,19,"So with respect to Gigafactory capex, I think we learned a tremendous amount with Gigafactory 1, and we're confident that we can do the Gigafactory in China for a lot less.
I think it's probably closer to ...
this is just a guess but probably closer to $2 billion, and that should be at a higher ...
and that would be sort of at the 250,000 vehicles per year rate.
So I think we can be a lot more efficient with capex, and that would include at least a factory module and pack production, body shop, paint shop and general assembly.
Might even be less than that but that's about the right number for that.
And then cell production is something we're still figuring out with respect to the Shanghai factory.
JB, would you like to add to that?
"
1968,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,20,"Yeah, I think, we ...
like less than half is like would be a good estimate.

So it's just ...
we just learned a tremendous amount about manufacturing, it's like ...
it's definitely burned out a lot of neurons, yeah, mental scar tissue, it's [Inaudible] like next level but on the plus side, we really know a lot about volume manufacturing at this point.

So, you'd like [Inaudible] by the way, a little tip for if you're driving Model S or X or 3, is if you just tap the Navigate button and just drag down, it will automatically navigate you to your home or work, depending upon where you are.
That's a pretty cool feature.

Yes.
"
1973,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,25,"Yeah, obviously one of the keys to success on the Model 3 production was the GA4 thing, which was led by Jerome.
And General Assembly is key, and doing the sort of Zone 1, 2, semiauto lines, which were critical because we had this fundamental failure especially in Zone 1 ...
Zone 2 of factory module production.
Thank you, Jerome.
It turns out Jerome was pulling some pretty incredible rabbits out of the hat.

when people like say tent, they'll think it's like some sort of ...
something made by REI to go camping.
This is a tent that is actually commonly used as a permanent structure.
It's a giant thing that is very commonly used as a permanent structure and we just had to come up with a creative solution because GA3 was not going to be able to make the rate and so we had to come up with some ideas, and tell people how that all transpired.
It's interesting if you want to...

It is like [Inaudible] really satisfying about building a car.

1977,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,29,"Especially Model 3.
Like it was probably we had two weeks to solve this problem, which is like quasi-impossible.
So, we actually didn't have time to order new equipment, because it would have taken too long to arrive.
So, we took the conveyors that we discarded from the GA3 line, which didn't work or was way too complex to actually deliver pods.
[Inaudible]
"
1978,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,30,"Well, I think like the really cool idea was putting them on the 1% grade.
So it's like technically the conveyors for parts delivery to GA3 were not graded to be able to move something as heavy as a car, so we made it downhill and on a 1%-downward grade with the car at the top.
So then, you can actually overcome the transport...

1979,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,31,"Yeah, gravity.

"
1981,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,33,"And something that's like somewhat counterintuitive is that this actually has fully considered fewer labor hours per car than the GA3 system.
And just to elaborate on what Jerome was saying, where we have parts delivery to GA4, the truck literally just backs up to the side of the line, where there is like a door in the tent.
And then, that is used to unload parts from suppliers directly to where they are needed on the line.
So there's no intermediate assistant.
Whereas for GA3, they're unloaded, they're put in a warehouse, then they're repackaged from the warehouse into these totes, which we actually have 220 people, something like that, across all shifts whose only job it was to repackage parts from the boxes that came in from suppliers to the boxes ...
to these totes that go into the lifters that go up into GA3.
That's literally all they do is move things from one box to another box, and we don't need that at all on GA4.

Pete's a super humble guy but it would be great just to talk about the stuff you've done before.
"
1983,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,35,"All gone, yeah.
And there's a tremendous amount of 24/7 robotics technicians that are constantly trying to make the machines have uptime.
That's very expensive and that's where we figured like not having to maintain all these robotic systems, that's a big cost savings as well.
And now we're going to be gradually adding simple automation into GA4 to make it easier to build a car and better sort of labor-saving devices but it's just fundamentally ...
it's already at an efficiency level greater than GA3, which is pretty impressive.

we will not be raising any equity at any point, at least that's ...
I have no expectation of doing so, do not plan to do so.
For China, I think, our default plan will be to use essentially a loan from the local banks in China and fund the Gigafactory in Shanghai with local debt, essentially.
And we certainly could raise money but I think we don't need to and we ...
yeah, I think, it's better to ...
it is better discipline not to.

I wouldn't call it weapons grade.
It's just like the car is trying to drive and if anything the autonomous cars will be pretty easy to bully because they would optimize so much for avoiding collision.
So that will be more of a challenge than anything else is as soon as somebody sees the car's autonomous, they know they can like cut them off and the car is going to do everything it can avoid like a collision.
So it's like that will actually be probably a bigger challenge than anything else but we've not encountered anything of the nature of what you're saying.

So that's ...
the focus is really massively on the safety of existing features.
Then there's an advanced dev role that do things like recognize traffic lights and stop signs and make hard right turns and that kind of thing but it's not at the safety level that's considered OK for release.
So that ...
yeah, because it really, you want many lines of reliability for anything that's released to end customers.
So I don't want to take the team off that until we feel like we've really got everything as best we can for the core functionality.

And we're hoping to get that out to early access program in about four weeks and then broadly in September.
That's the hardcore focus right now, and that will certainly include some significant advancements in autonomy.

That's well said.
Actually, it's really worth emphasizing JB's point here.
Yeah.
We're seeing a gain.
"
2004,TSLA,2018,2,elon-musk,"chairman,-product-architect,-and-ceo",False,56,"Cool.
Thanks.
Yeah, I mean, essentially the key is to be able to run the neural net at a bare metal level so that it's especially doing the calculations in the circuits itself and not in some sort of emulation mode which is how a GPU or a CPU would operate.
So, you want to do basically a massive amount of localized matrix multiplication with the memory right there.
So, it's a huge number of very simple complications with the memory needed to store the results of those complications right next to the circuits that are doing the matrix calculations.
And the net effect is an order of magnitude improvement in the frames per second.
Our current hardware, which ...
I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they do great stuff but using a GPU, fundamentally it's an emulation mode, and then you also get choked on the bus.
So, the transfer between the GPU and the CPU ends up being one that constrains the system.
So, the net effect is we're able to, with the Tesla computer ...
and we've been like semi-stealth mode basically for the last two to three years on this but I think it's probably time to let the cat out of the bag because the cat's going to come out of the bag anyway but it's an incredible job by Pete and his team to create this, the world's most advanced computer designed specifically for autonomous operation.
And there's a rough sort of [Inaudible] whereas the current [Inaudible] hardware can do 200 frames a second, this is able to do over 2,000 frames a second and with full redundancy and fail-over.
So, it's an amazing design and we're going to be looking to increase the size of our chip team and our investment in that as quickly as possible.
I think we have some of the best aces [Inaudible] in the world but I think we want to build on that even more.
And it costs the same as our current hardware and we anticipate that this would have to be replaced, this replacement, which is why I made it easy to switch out the computer, and that's all that needs to be done.
If we take out one computer, plug in the next.
That's it.
All the connectors are compatible and you get an order of magnitude, more processing and you can run all the cameras at primary full resolution with the complex neural net.
So it's super kick-ass.

I'm not sure what the allocation is between top five or where it goes beyond the top five.
We just sort of out of curiosity asked for the top five breakdowns.
And it's just interesting that people are trading up into a Tesla, so they're choosing to spend more money on a Tesla than their current car, just based on the trade-in values.
A Civic is a very inexpensive car compared to particularly the Model 3 today.
So that's promising from a market-access standpoint but of course, long-term, we're going to do the Model Y and the compact SUV.
We're going to do the pickup truck, the Semi, the next generation bus [Inaudible].
We got lots of awesome ideas, and probably the biggest limiter on our growth is like how fast can we grow battery production? And especially cell production and the wholesale supply chain I think will be the fundamental determinant of Tesla's growth.

With respect to gross margin, I'll touch on that and then hand the rest to Deepak but, certainly, when it's going up the production line, there are a tremendous amount of inefficiencies.
There's a lot of hurry up and wait, where some parts of the production line move well.
Then, one part doesn't and you have associates waiting around with nothing to do.
There are parts that we thought were right but then it turns out they weren't right.
We then send them back to the supplier.
It's just like the whole sort of giant machine.
It just needs to kind of lurch into a high pace and there's a lot of lurching, which is very inefficient.
So, you end up having super high labor costs per car and it just takes time to sort of spool up this giant machine.
Basically, a production system is like a giant cybernetic collector and it moves as fast as the slowest part.
So, as we address those slow parts and as we improve efficiency, gross margin and so the profitability per car just improves dramatically.
That's sort of at a high level.
Deepak, do you want to add to that?

And the [Inaudible] we've made significant improvements to the design since the unveiling that we had, and it's really even better than what we talked about.
Probably my personal favorite for the next product is pickup truck, and we are going to just do an amazing pickup truck.
And the Model Y, compact SUV, probably the most popular car category in the world, so that's like obviously going to sell pretty well.
So a lot of cool things.
And of course, Tesla Energy, getting the ...
we're kind of cell starved for Powerwall right now, so we actually had to artificially limit the number of Powerwalls because we don't have enough cells.
So we're solving for that very rapidly and we expect to ramp up Powerwall and Powerpack production substantially later this year and early next and as well as ramping up retrofit solar and then the Solar Roof.
We now have several hundred homes with the Solar Roof on them, and that's going well.
It takes a while to just confirm that the Solar Roof is going to last for 30 years and all the details work out, and we're working with first responders to make sure it's safe in the event of a fire and that kind of thing.
So it's quite a long validation program for a roof which has got to last for 30, 40, 50 years but we also expect to ramp that up next year at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo.
That's going to be super exciting.
If there's a company with a better product roadmap, I'd like to know where it is, because we've got some super awesome stuff coming.

I'm like, oh, man, this is like shooting myself in the foot there.
Right now, the biggest constraint on production again, please, do not make a federal case out of this, because it's something that's solved like in a matter of a week or two, is body production.
So that's why ...
you can generally tell what am I personally working on, that's going to be a bottleneck in the company most likely, so reducing Model 3 bodies.
We've made huge progress in the last few weeks and in fact I was just told that we were able to achieve our first 24 hour period where we made over 800 Model 3 bodies which is pretty great.

there needs to be a lot more electricians.

Because it seems like you ramped auto battery pack to 20 gigawatt hours in the past 12 months but are only guiding for about 1 gigawatt hour of Tesla Energy installation in the next year.

The new fiscal engineering strategy of profits and cash flow and you saying that would last in perpetuity sort of caught me by surprise, personally.

First of all, thanks for the recent retweet, Elon.
I was really impressed with the Model 3 after owning a Model S, so I'm really impressed by how much you've developed since the early days.
My first question was about Conquest sales, actually.
Right before the call, we published an article that Camry sales were down 22% year over year, Prius sales were down 23% year over year.
Now we're very curious how much you're pulling from these other cars, other segments.
It sounds like you sort of answered that question at the beginning but can you give anything in terms of what percentage those top five are in terms of trade-in sales? And how broad you're pulling? I know you pull from pickup trucks, from sports cars.
Can you speak a little more about the diversity you're pulling from?

2069,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,1,"And regarding the...
"
2070,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,2,"I love it.
"
2071,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,3,"And regarding the Model Y, there's been a lot of questions if you're going to have the same process as with Model 3 with reservations, if you're going to shorten the reservation timeline or if you're going to have a different process this time around.
"
2072,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,4,"So the last question then.
Regarding the daily production, we've been seeing a rise and fall with the daily production of the Model 3 as you incorporate new performance or white seats.
Can you speak at all ...
we always like to get the technical side of what you're doing there.
Can you speak at all about what the bottlenecks are right now that you're working through? And what we can sort of ...
how we can picture ourselves in the factory there with you?
"
2073,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,5,"Yeah.
We know.
"
2074,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,6,"Yeah.
[Inaudible] questions but I'll end with a quick request.
Years ago you...
"
2075,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,7,"Years ago you warned about a coming short tsunami and it seemed obvious it was coming but the shorts didn't really seem to recognize that and then sort of attacked you, trolled you for months and then finally, it came.
You again warned very honestly, I think very directly, that there's going to be an epic short squeeze.
We have I think the whole community has a little request.
Don't let the trolls get you down, don't see the trolls too much but we do like it when you tease the trolls a bit.
So use your judgment but thanks a lot for what you're doing.
"
2076,TSLA,2018,2,zachary-shahan,cleantechnica,True,8,
2077,TSLA,2018,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,0,"Thank you for having me on.
So I wanted to make sure we understand well how you start earning cash going forward, in coming quarters.
And my understanding is that an important moving part here, probably the most important one is the positive impact of the ramp of the Model 3 on your working capital.
And so I did some quick math on the quarter and I see you were able to increase by $430 million, while your risk level didn't move much, which makes sense because you get paid on the spot and you pay your suppliers only on the 60-day notice or more.
And so if I divide that by the number of incremental cars you've been producing in the quarter, I get to $23,000 per car.
And of course my question is whether this is a good way to think about it, which means that going forward when we move into Q3 and Q4 every additional car, every additional Model 3 you're going to produce you're going to bump it payable by something in the region of the $20,000 and that's going to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burning cash.
"
2078,TSLA,2018,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,1,"In terms of follow-up.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
"
2079,TSLA,2018,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,2,"My follow-up was on in terms of order of magnitude, does like $20,000 per car of payables boost over a 60-day period, does that sound like something that makes sense or am I missing other moving part?
"
2080,TSLA,2018,2,pierre-ferragu,new-street-research,True,3,"Excellent.
Thank you.

2082,TSLA,2018,2,andrej-karpathy,director-of-ai,False,0,"Hello everyone.
My name is Andrej Karpathy, and I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla.
In particular, I lead the vision team which is responsible for turning the video stream that we receive from all the cameras and the vehicle into an understanding of what is around us and around the vehicle.
I worked with Neural Networks for about 10 years mostly as a [Inaudible].
And what I'm really excited about is really building out this infrastructure for computer vision that underlies all the neural network training, trying to get those networks to work extremely well, and make that a really good foundation on top of which we build out all the features of the autopilot like the features associated with the v9 release that's going to come up and that Stuart as mentioned.
"
2083,TSLA,2018,2,andrej-karpathy,director-of-ai,False,1,
2084,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Elon, you described it extremely well.
So just to sort of summarize, this was a major milestone for us in Q2 that the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly positive and we feel really good about the path ahead.
And as Elon said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies.
The labor hours that we use to produce each car becomes less.
The initial ramp-up costs that we have that are one-time, those inefficiencies disappear.
Our fixed costs that are there that gets leveraged to a higher volume.
So, all of that.
"
2085,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"And the journey just continues as we stabilize and grow production from these levels we achieve even more efficiencies.
And Q3 also benefits with a somewhat improved mix [Inaudible] All-Wheel Drive and performance cars and in the long run, as we continue to achieve those efficiencies on cost, our gross margins will continue to increase.
"
2086,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"So your question is after July, how close are we to cash-flow positive?
"
2087,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah, well, we don't have, let me tell this point, one, we don't have July results done but it doesn't matter exactly where we are in the month of July.
What really matters is over the quarter because it depends on deliveries, depends on production, many factors.
So we will be significantly cash-flow positive for the quarter.
I think that's what really matters.
"
2088,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, that's the simple answer.
"
2089,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"We're sitting here today saying that based on what our expectation is.
So yes, sitting here on August 1.
"
2090,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Straightforward.
"
2091,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah, as Elon suggested earlier, we are ...
essentially makes sense for us to prioritize Model 3 but we are adding a ton of capacity, cell capacity and JB can talk more about it that will enable us to dramatically ramp our energy storage business as well in the coming quarters.
"
2092,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"I think to put it in perspective, we are soon tripling our storage.
"
2093,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"And it's one thing to produce but it's also another thing to install.
"
2094,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"You need infrastructure and the people to do that.
So, it's massive scaling as very few companies grow at that rate.
"
2095,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yeah.
"
2096,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Yeah, it's been heartening to see the mix in terms of what customers want.
Robin can probably add more to that.
"
2097,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,13,
2098,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"Yeah, we're executing on an operating plan that keeps us sufficiently self-funded despite our CAPEX needs and our debts maturing, and still, keep a very healthy balance on our balance sheet.
"
2099,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"And still be ...
still have a healthy cash balance.
"
2100,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"And to answer the other question, there is no such notice from a regulator.
"
2101,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,17,"Deepak here.
I mean, there are many factors.
Clearly, the working capital benefit of the difference in the payable terms versus electing cash is one of them but also, it's our gross margin improvement on the business.
With the ...
it's the higher volumes and the higher gross margins, I'm taken higher gross profit, I'm stating the obvious here on Model 3.
Our SNX volumes are increasing too in the second half.
That's going to help us significantly.
And all of our other businesses are improving their profitability.
While our opex is staying essentially flat, so massive leverage in the business.
So when you combine all of that, that's what is giving us the cash flow from operations to fund the rest of our business and grow cash.
I'm stating the obvious but just I was summarizing the whole point.
Yeah.
"
2102,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,18,"Sorry.
What was your question?
"
2103,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,19,"It's rough order of magnitude, correct, yeah.
"
2104,TSLA,2018,2,deepak-ahuja,chief-financial-officer,False,20,"It'll be lower ASPs than what we have today, clearly, and we are having a richer mix of All-Wheel Drive, as Elon alluded to earlier, so that's going to help but yeah.
25% is still the target that we have ahead of us.
"
2105,TSLA,2018,2,alex-haissl,berenberg,True,0,"Good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking the question.
I would like to come back to the point made on the manufacturing efficiencies.
I mean, [Inaudible] two main challenges for Tesla but also for the rest of the industry is the manufacturing parts, which has been overcome by a lot of companies already, with the second one being the technology part.
My question is how would you describe the learning curve of the manufacturing process versus technology and what is really the pace of advancement you're making? Because it looks like on the manufacturing side the curve maybe has meaningfully accelerated here.
Thank you.
"
2106,TSLA,2018,2,alex-haissl,berenberg,True,1,
2107,TSLA,2018,2,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,0,"OK.
Hi, I'm Stuart.
"
2108,TSLA,2018,2,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,1,"Yeah, we'll talk extra loud.
So I'm Stuart.
Yeah, joined the team relatively recently.
Incredibly excited to kind of see the foundation the team has built up until this point and we're building on top of that right now.
So right now, a lot of the focus is on autopilot v9, which is our sort of on-ramp to off-ramp solution that's going to automatically attempt to change lanes, understand what lane the car is in, understand the route the user wants to travel and take that route for the user and ultimately hand back control to that user which is kind of stay in [Inaudible] control.
"
2109,TSLA,2018,2,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,2,"So, yeah, that's part of the focus right now.
We're also kind of digging in on some new safety features.
I think probably the thing which is most exciting for me, coming from the team is just seeing the foundation that's been built out over the last two years.
I think Andrej will talk a lot about some of the perception and vision work we've done there with the data engine.
That has sort of allowed us to build on top of that very, very quickly and I think we're all starting to see a new set of safety features that really only make sense in this world, we have an extremely high understanding of what's happening around the vehicle.
So, I think when I start thinking about like what gets me excited when I come into work, it's like, one, starting to introduce real aspects of kind of not just making the commute kind of reducing the drudgery or kind of the risk of commuting but also really [Inaudible] fun and the second is like dramatically improving safety in a way that you really can only do once you have the [Inaudible] very nuanced understanding of the world around you with perception.
"
2110,TSLA,2018,2,stuart-bowers,vice-president-of-engineering,False,3,"Yeah, I mean, I think the big thing I would say is to reiterate Elon's point.
There's no question you can kind of build a demo around this stuff.
The challenge right now for the team is just increasing the safety and utility of autopilot to over 250,000 cars we have today and pushing more out after that.
So I think when we look forward to what the next probably six to 12 months look like, it's taking those same kinds of features we've been working on, probably deploying them in the form of active safety features.
That's like a thing we can do already to understand like ...
use this rich understanding of the environment to actually try to keep you safer, to either beep or brake.
And then also, of course, like one huge advantage that we have is we can understand what humans actually did in these vehicles and test our software to make sure that we would have made decisions that were similar if not safer.
So that's going to be a huge part of what we do over the next probably two quarters.

Good afternoon.
Thanks.
Maybe we could tackle some of the commentary about the Gigafactory coming in China.
When you first announced the Gigafactory 1, I think you said that was going to be about a $5 billion investment, and you mentioned some volume numbers associated with what you think you could do in China.
So we do some extrapolation, looks like maybe 15 gigawatt hours of initial capacity.
I'm wondering if you could also do a linear extrapolation on the costs you think you need for that factory.

2123,TSLA,2018,2,peter-bannon,director-of-silicon-engineering,False,0,"Hi.
This is Pete Bannon.
My team is leading currently the Hardware 3 development.
The chips are up and working, and we have drop-in replacements for S, X and 3, all have been driven in the field.
They support the current networks running today in the car at full frame rates with a lot of idle cycles to spare.
So, I think we're all really excited about what Andrej and his team will be able to do with this hardware in the future.
I think like one little anecdotal story was I gave a talk to his team on Hardware 3 last month explaining how it worked and what it was capable of, and then afterwards, one of the researchers came up to me and he was really excited, and he said, this is so exciting and I'm really excited about exploring this hardware and he said, I think people are going to want to come and work at Tesla, just to have access to this hardware and to try it out because it's so exciting.
So as a hardware designer, having excited software developers is the best.
And it's a really fun place to work because I do get to work with my two primary customers, Stuart and Andrej, and making them happy is pretty fun.
"
2124,TSLA,2018,2,peter-bannon,director-of-silicon-engineering,False,1,"Let's see.
I started working and designing computers at Digital Equipment Corporation in 1984, back when they were refrigerator-sized, and I've been working on smaller and smaller designs ever since.
I was Intel Fellow working on a team for a little while, then I was VP of Architecture and Verification at PA Semi, which was acquired at Apple.
I led the design of the first ARM 32-bit processor that went into the iPhone 5.
I built the team that designed the first ARM 64-bit processor in the world which went into the iPhone 5S.
And then I worked on performance modeling and performance improvements at Apple for eight years.
And then two years later, I came to Tesla and designed the neural network accelerator that's part of Hardware 3 and helped architect the rest of the Hardware 3 solution that will be in the car next year.
"
2125,TSLA,2018,2,peter-bannon,director-of-silicon-engineering,False,2,"Sure.
So, like three years ago when I joined Tesla, we did a survey of all of the solutions that were out there for running neural networks, including GPUs.
We went and talked to other people like at ARM that were building embedded solutions for running neural networks.
And pretty much everywhere we looked, if somebody had a hammer, whether it was a CPU or a GPU or whatever, they were adding something to accelerate neural networks but nobody was doing a bottoms-up design from scratch, which is what we elected to do.
We had the benefit of having the insight into seeing what Tesla's neural networks looked like back then and having projections of what they would look like into the future, and we were able to leverage all of that knowledge and our willingness to totally commit to that style of computing to previous design that's dramatically more efficient and has dramatically more performance than what you can buy today.

2128,F,2022,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi everybody.
Thanks for taking my question.
First, I wanted to ask you about inflation.
Price versus cost is, obviously, a pretty big drag here and I assume that you would expect inflation to stick around for a while.
I was hoping you might talk a little bit about how that's influencing your decision-making, your internal messaging.
What is in your view going to be the interplay between price and volume as volume and inventory starts to normalize? Is there still pricing power after everything you've achieved over the past couple of years? And does this affect your margin targets?
"
2129,F,2022,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"Thanks for that.
And any color on the outlook for Europe for the rest of this year just given all of the macro pressures there? It looks, you've been posting pretty solid results there recently.
"
2130,F,2022,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead.

2131,F,2022,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,3,
2132,F,2022,1,hau-thai-tang,chief-industrial-platform-officer,False,0,"Yeah.
Thanks John.
So as John mentioned in his remarks in March, we had the highest production run rate that, we've seen frankly in the last couple of quarters.
That's the result of a lot of hard work, with all of our suppliers at every level of the value chain to break constraints, ensure that we're getting our fair allocation, as well as expediting freight to pull ahead some of the available supply.
In parallel, the design actions that we've taken over the past year to design our way out of some of these constraints are coming online.
And if you guys reflect on last year many of our wafer and chip suppliers started implementing capacity actions, and those are also coming on in the back end of the year.
So that's what's giving us the increased confidence around the guidance that John highlighted.
"
2133,F,2022,1,hau-thai-tang,chief-industrial-platform-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
So we had a wiper module that was deployed on our most profitable vehicle lines as John mentioned our large pickup trucks and utilities in North America.
So we had limited ability to do any mix management and flex, with other lower-profit vehicle lines.
That issue has been resolved.
We've designed our way out of it.
And again, we have a line of sight to not only support the back half of the year production, but also address some of vehicle on wheels with that commodity.
"
2134,F,2022,1,hau-thai-tang,chief-industrial-platform-officer,False,2,"Yeah.
Mark so the two hotspots that you highlighted Ukraine, Russia I think we've done a really good job of managing that and minimizing any large significant production risk mostly because of our global sourcing patterns and we were able to get parts from other areas of the world.
In terms of China, we're scaling the Shanghai area.
We have about 50 Tier 1 suppliers there.
Our focus is on our profit pillar vehicles, and as Jim mentioned really leveraging expedited freight.
We've secured fast maritime shipment as well as airlift capacity to protect our suppliers.
And then they're just starting to have a white list process to allow suppliers to resume production.
So we're working with our teams on the ground in China to help those suppliers get partially operational.
So those actions we think will really help us.
And as Jim mentioned what's going to be gating us is semiconductors.
A lot of these constraints are nested within that.
So it comes down to the work that we're doing on the semiconductor supply.

2141,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Hello, everyone.
Thank you, Lynn, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call.
Yesterday, I was with Bill Ford and our incredible team at the Rouge factory, where my grandfather worked, to celebrate Job One for the F-150 Lightning.
We were all so proud as a team for delivering a truly breakthrough electric truck and delivering it on time as a launch.
The excitement around the truck is like nothing I've ever seen in my career.
In fact, the power went out in the facility, and we ran most of the presentation with F-150 Pro power on board.
While we have work ahead to fully scale production and fill an extraordinary order bank, both for our retail Lightning customers and Ford Pro, make no mistake, this is a very important moment for us at Ford.
We're accelerating our significant transformation.
We have the right plan called Ford+.
We are putting in place the right organization.
As you know, on March 2, we announced our plan to form two distinct but interdependent business units called Ford Model e and Ford Blue.
Together with Ford Pro, these three automotive businesses allow us to clearly define and assign priorities, make the most of our existing strengths, but also build new strategic muscles and, most importantly, capabilities.
Ford Model e is responsible for delivering clean sheet breakthrough EV designs, software advanced electric architectures, partial autonomy.
And Ford Blue's mission is to deliver a more vibrant and profitable ICE business, a business that's going to serve in the short term as our profit and cash engine for the entire enterprise.
So what have we learned since March 2? And what are we working on at Ford? In terms of Model e, first, it's very clear to us that battery capacity is the key unlock to our EV aspirations and propel our growth in the future.
We're in good shape in the near term.
In the medium and long term, securing raw materials, processing, precursor and refinement and setting up battery production here in the U.S.
and around the world is a big work statement for us.
Expect a lot of news from Ford in the future related to the vertical integration of our EV business.
Second, we're getting after our talent gap in key areas, EV engineering, software and autonomous driving technology.
We have a very good start already, and we will continually be very aggressive on recruiting talent.
Third, we're now deep into discussions with our dealer partners around the globe, but especially in North America, on brand new standards that are required to launch a completely different customer experience that is leaner and better for our customers that we believe will not only be competitive but superior to a solely direct model.
We're drafting standards as we speak and plan to roll this out this year.
Finally, we're crafting our EV future product pipeline and are focused on a small number of highly compelling, highly volume models in key segments where we already lead.
I want to make this very clear, some companies seem to be pursuing a strategy of trying to match model-wise volume with eight or nine top hats.
That's not a winning plan in our view.
We will focus on key volume nameplates, constrained capital because we have it, but really to leverage scale and efficiency to reach and eventually exceed our 8% EBIT target for EVs.
I want to be clear here that as we move forward, our EV designs will be progressive, and they're going to be aimed at bringing new customers to Ford and Lincoln.
They will not be electric versions of our existing lineup.
Now in terms of Ford Blue, we will accelerate our restructuring and address our uncompetitive cost structure.
We're going to attack complexity in areas such as powertrain.
We can't wait.
This work starts now.
We will continue to invest in our ICE business but in targeted ways to build our most popular and profitable vehicle lines, F-Series, Bronco, Super Duty and a few others.
Another focus is quality.
We made good progress on initial quality and launches.
However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions.
This has to change.
We must do more to aggressively address our engineering process and improve our robustness.
Now, our Ford Pro business is on track.
We see healthy growth in parts sales, mechanic repairs, growth in subscriptions for both charging and telematics, and CV financing.
Most importantly, we're making our customers' lives and businesses better.
They're using data.
They're improving their uptime and their bottom line.
Supply chain constraints continue to impact our business, including some of our key profit pillars.
That said, we're making progress on launching and scaling new products as you can see with Lightning.
That said, our major focus now is accelerating a more fundamental change in our supply chain management to improve visibility through our entire value chain and secure supply, especially in places like Semis and batteries.
We're absolutely committed to unlocking value by improving our growth profile, our profitability and ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our automotive-related businesses.
Our new targets include producing more than two million EVs in four short years by the end of 2026.
That's about 70-plus CAGR.
And we expect that by 2030, EVs will account for about 50% of our global sales.
We have also reset our profit ambition.
We are now targeting 10% company-adjusted EBIT margins by 2026.
Now, in terms of the first quarter, I would describe our performance as mixed.
The appeal of our new products is really clear, and customers demand is extremely strong beyond the supply constraint of our industry.
However, we are still grappling with persistent supply chain issues that prevent us from posting even stronger quarter.
We're working to break constraints whenever they exist to take full advantage of this incredibly hot product lineup.
Both new EVs like the F-150 Lightning but our iconic ICE vehicles as well.
We remain committed to delivering our targets quarter after quarter, year after year, earning your confidence along the way.
And now, I'd like to turn it to John to take you through the quarter and our outlook this year.
"
2142,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Hi, Rod, thank you for your question.
Obviously we're seeing on the commodity side steel, aluminum, copper, lithium, nickel.
On the logistics side a lot of premium freight.
We're seeing pressures on inflation from suppliers.
So it's really across the board.
I'll let John answer the pricing question, but I would say, we really have quite a bit of pricing we've recently put in the market.
It's stuck.
And in addition, we feel like we have a lot of cost upside as well in the company.
I know that's not your question, but that's an opportunity.
John?
"
2143,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Yes.
We've been working on LFP for quite some time, so let's just leave it at that.
What I mean by that is, engineering LFP solutions in our first generation of products something that we see is a big opportunity and to move quickly.
"
2144,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"No.
No.
But Doug is here.
OK.
I'll pass it on to her.
"
2145,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"The message would be we need to work together and find good deals.
That's what the message would be that we know what we're looking for.
We're focused on lithium and nickel those two.
We want to do smart deals that work for them and for us.
And number two we want to move some of the processing in North America.
And we're willing to invest capital to move the processing precursor work from overseas to North America for a variety of reasons.
Doug, would you edit that list?
"
2146,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Hau, do you want to comment on that specific comment because I -- commodity, because I think it is really material.
"
2147,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Our opportunity is really around our cost in our Blue business.
That's how we look at it.
In terms of investing, we need to invest in a fully networked advanced electric architecture.
We need to advance -- we need to invest in Level 2 and Level 3 autonomy.
We need to invest in a new portfolio and changing our industrial system over to these electric digital products.
We need to invest in our OS software that supports all of that.
And we need -- we believe very strongly we need to invest in Level 4 autonomy.
So at this point in time, I don't personally see any discretionary -- our Ford+ plan is so specific about where to invest.
That -- at this point in time, our real work that we need to do is to get after these inefficiencies and improve the productivity of our base business.
That's really where we're focused.
And of course, it's implied that as a management team we need to make these investments as efficiently as we can for all this new technology and growth.
I hope that makes sense to you.
"
2148,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"I think reception has been terrific.
We worked hard on this and we were prepared.
We know -- we knew kind of what we needed to communicate to the employees and why this is necessary and why it makes sense.
So I think the reception has been good.
The proof in the pudding is going to be how this executes.
And we're -- that's why I wanted to give an update actually in my comments on what we've done since March 2 and a lot has changed.
Doug over to you.
"
2149,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Thank you.
It really comes down to the commodities -- semiconductor-related commodities that have been hamstringing us.
We, obviously, are spending a lot of money on premium freight and other things to work around COVID escalations in China.
But really the second half of the year's production increase relates to those.
So Hau I don't know if you want to add anything specifically.
"
2150,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
Unfortunately at this point, we're not going to comment on Rivian.
"
2151,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Thank you.
Well, first of all Argo, and Ryan continue to make great progress technically on the SDS for Level 4 autonomy.
We're very happy with the technical progress.
Number two, we really see maybe different than others Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 as two distinct products.
Yes, Argo could help us with our semi-autonomous capability, but we feel like that would be a big distraction for them, which we do not want them distracted at all.
And number three it's taking time.
And this is expensive stuff.
And so from our standpoint getting access to the capital markets is very critical to give us the flexibility to continue to fund this for many years to come.
One thing I would say is we're very focused on partners that would be aligned strategically with Argo, use cases that would be very material in the deployment of Argo's technology.
And we're getting more and more interested as a company maybe a bit of a strategic shift on goods movement.
It's aligned with our commercial vehicle business and our customers feel they're getting more and more interested in middle mile specifically.
I think that's a material update for Argo and hopefully that helps you.
"
2152,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"No.
I mean our -- absolutely not.
I'll try to make that -- I'll say it twice.
We are really excited about our growth opportunity in EVs.
We have electric architectures to invest in, software OS.
We have partial autonomy to invest in, full autonomy to invest in.
That's all part of our Ford+ plan.
It's essential to our move to always on.
We obviously have lots of investments in building out our service portfolio for Ford Pro.
We're not holding back on any of that.
The cost drivers that we see are things like, obviously, manufacturing as we simplify our ICE lineup.
And as Doug said, really completely redesign our manufacturing process for EV.
We have opportunities in sales and marketing and sales, opportunity in engineering as we simplify our lineup and, of course, warranty and other areas.
So I think we're -- we know exactly what we need to do.
"
2153,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Percent of revenue.
"
2154,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"And I'll just make it really clear on the overall company's automotive performance, financial performance.
The second half is very critical for us.
It's just a very critical time for the company.
We have the opportunity to build in volumes we haven't for a while.
And we have a lot of great fresh products, a lot of costs coming in the business, but second half is really critical for the company.
"
2155,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,
2156,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Well, I didn't know we announced that but thank you very much for your question.
I'd like to maybe ask Doug to come in here and talk about the levers we have on the profit side.
But so far it's very clear to us that the Lightning customers are incremental.
And as you said it's early days.
We capacitized in the end of the day the facility that we were in is about 80,000 units.
We'll almost double that by the end of next year.
And I would say at this point the customer profile is dramatically younger.
It's in states like California and New York that we normally don't sell full-size trucks.
We do have some -- lots of orders in Texas.
It's a higher education that we see.
And what they're interested in is different about the truck.
So I think it's very clearly so far incremental.
Now when we get into volume production 150,000 units that may change.
And we'll see that with the order as we order -- open the order bank again for the next model year this summer.
Doug, do you want to highlight the opportunities you see maybe on F-150 Lightning but more generically on our next product?
"
2157,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"John...
"
2158,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"Go ahead.
Go ahead John.
"
2159,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"I just wanted to say on the Super Duty, obviously, that's a quarter of profitability as a company globally.
And when we look at the customer usage, we just don't feel at this point that an electric solution is going to be ideal for most of those customers.
So our vehicles, plural, will be really focused on Light Duty and the lower end of Super Duty for sure.
But not 250s, 350s, 450s.
That's a whole different ball of wax.
They require a lot of payload -- heavy batteries, that doesn't make sense.
"
2160,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"Thank you for your question.
Well, first of all, the demand for EVs right now is extremely robust at Ford.
So we have the opportunity we believe for pricing.
We're not going to get into those details now.
But Doug said something very important, Colin, I want to emphasize, which is battery chemistry.
We believe very strongly at Ford.
The chemistry we have really key part of our protection against commodity price increases, and frankly, the benefits to the customer.
Doug, do you want to add anything?
"
2161,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,20,"So in the short-term, we...
"
2162,F,2022,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Go ahead with your question.
Sorry, Colin.
"
2163,F,2022,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
As you mentioned, the EV battery costs have really dramatically increased.
Has that changed your EV strategy at all? Do you think you're going to need to maybe raise the pricing of the Lightning and the Mach-E? And what can you do about it or maybe switch to different chemistries, roll out more hybrid? How can you address it if raw materials stay at these very high levels for that, those battery materials?
"
2164,F,2022,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,1,"Can you which two tells us please?
"
2165,F,2022,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,2,"Yes.
I was just going to say you mentioned you're able to do LFP or that's in the plan.
I mean, how quickly can you switch because nickel is spiked now? I mean, I'm just kind of wondering how flexible and how quick you could adapt to that $2 million target by 2025?
"
2166,F,2022,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,3,"Got it.
And just second question, you mentioned in your comments about warranty costs and that was going to be a big driver of margins.
It does look like it was up year over year.
Is that just sort of a temporary blip in the quarter, or is there a structural issue that we're going to see some higher elevated warranty through the rest of the year? Hello.

2169,F,2022,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, everybody.
I just wanted to ask a question sort of on the growth side, Jim.
I mean the F-150 Lightning orders, it sounds like they're mostly incremental buyers, folks that haven't been Ford or F-150 buyers before.
I'm just curious if you think that is just sort of a surge here at the launch of the truck or is this sort of 15% to 20% sort of incremental orders relative to the base F-150, something you think will stick around? I mean because, obviously, that's very powerful potentially to your earnings.
And do you expect the profitability of this truck over time to have a variable margin that would be similar to the F-150? I think sort of being even a little bit more verbose, do you expect the same kind of thing with the 250, 350 Lightning, which you'll launch in two or three years?
"
2170,F,2022,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"Actually can I just ask one follow...
"
2171,F,2022,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"No.
Keep going Jim.
Sorry I had a follow-up on...
"
2172,F,2022,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,"Got it.
And I'm sorry, a follow-up on the 53,000 units that are in inventory on wheels.
Is that what we're seeing in this 21% increase in inventory on the balance sheet from the fourth quarter to the first quarter? And presumably, the cost has not been accounted for at all here and we'll see those vehicles flush out to the system in the second or third quarter when the chips become available.
I'm just trying to understand John Lawler, the economics and what profitability boost may be from these vehicles flowing out.
Could you just kind of explain sort of how you're accounting for this and what the benefit might be in the second and third or fourth quarter when they actually are finished?
"
2173,F,2022,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,4,"I'm sorry, John, the costs are recognized in the first quarter results, but obviously, the revenue is not? I'm just trying to understand this because it sounds like it might have a big impact in sort of people's understanding of the cadence of earnings through the course of the year.

In face of ongoing industrywide supply chain disruption and unremitting pandemic hurdles, we continued to execute against our Ford+ plan, including strengthening our product portfolio, investing in electrification and other new and exciting opportunities, fundamental to growth and value creation.
In the first quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in adjusted EBIT, resulting in a margin of 6.7%.
The year-over-year decline in total company profits was driven by higher commodity prices and lower volume and mix, partially offset by higher net pricing as we take top-line pricing while remaining disciplined with our incentive spend.
Importantly, our operations outside of North America were profitable.
Global wholesales were down 9%, consistent with our guidance and reflecting the continued supply chain issues.
However, our run rate of vehicle production in North America improved significantly during the month of March, and we ended the quarter with an extremely healthy order bank.
In fact, in the U.S.
alone, our order bank is primed to deliver about $17 billion in revenue.
Ford credit delivered another strong quarter.
EBT was $900 million, reflecting strong lease residuals and credit loss performance.
Free cash flow was $600 million negative, more than explained by unfavorable timing differences and working capital deterioration due to the higher inventory levels, which included about 53,000 vehicles on wheels, completed but awaiting installation of components affected by the semiconductor supply shortage.
We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity, nearly $29 billion and $45 billion, respectively.
This includes our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter.
Our strong balance sheet provides a solid foundation to continue investing in our Ford+ priorities.
Now, let me briefly touch on business unit performance for the quarter.
North America delivered $1.6 billion of EBIT with a margin of 7.1%.
Now this is down year over year as net pricing improvements were more than offset by higher commodity costs, higher warranty expense, unfavorable mix and lower volume.
The volume and mix impact primarily reflects supply constraints unique to full-size pickups in large utilities.
South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering its third consecutive profitable quarter and its highest quarterly EBIT margin in over 10 years.
The region continues to focus on scaling its business for growth, especially pickup trucks and commercial vehicles.
In Europe, our operations delivered an EBIT margin of 3% despite a 9% decline in volumes.
The underlying trajectory of our business continues to improve.
However, the adverse impact of the near-term supply chain disruption is dampening our overall results.
Importantly, we continue to be the No.
1 commercial vehicle brand in Europe.
The transit has an extremely healthy order bank, and we recently launched the all-electric E-Transit in Turkey.
FORDLiive continues to grow, helping our commercial customers improve vehicle uptime and, ultimately, their bottom line.
And finally, Mustang Mach-E is now being sold online in most major markets.
Europe is building momentum toward a fully electric future, expecting to reach 600,000 vehicles by the end of 2026.
In China, we posted a moderate loss in the quarter.
However, our cost performance improved on both a year over year and sequential basis.
Lincoln continues to be a bright spot and profit pillar for the region.
Market share improved 20 basis points year over year, and the all-new Zephyr is off to a fast start.
In the first quarter, China also continued to make progress toward our electrification strategy.
We opened 10 more customer experience centers, now 35 in total, and made other investments to modernize our direct-to-consumer network.
Our international markets group performed well in the first quarter, continuing to be solidly profitable despite supply constraints and suspension of our joint venture operations in Russia.
The upcoming launch of the next-generation Ranger remains on track.
And in March, we unveiled the next-generation Ranger Raptor and Everest.
And finally, in mobility, we continue to make steady progress toward scale commercialization of moving people and moving goods.
In the first quarter, we divested our investments in both TransLoc and Spin, further rationalizing our portfolio with a focus on autonomous development.
And now, I'll share with you our current thinking about the remainder of 2022.
For the full year, our guidance is unchanged.
We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, which is up 15% to 25% from 2021, with adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion.
This reflects year-over-year growth in wholesales of 10% to 15% and assumes that semiconductor availability will improve in the second half, including the constraints that adversely impacted our full-size pickups and large utilities in North America in Q1.
We also assumed in our guidance that disruptions in the supply chain and local vehicle manufacturing operations resulting from the renewed COVID-related health concerns and lockdowns in China do not further deteriorate our supply chains.
Now, relative to adjusted EBIT.
On a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collective profitability outside of North America.
We also expect Ford credit EBT to be strong but lower than 2021, and mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat.
Other assumptions factored into our guidance include, first, we have a very strong order bank, as Jim mentioned, for our new iconic products such as Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick, along with a robust EV lineup Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit, F-150 Lightning now in production as well.
Second, pent-up demand beyond our order bank, a continued strong pricing environment, including the benefit of pricing actions taken in the first quarter and improved mix.
The interplay role between volume and pricing will remain dynamic.
And third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset by improvements in net pricing and mix.
Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures to continue impacting a broad range of costs.
We are aggressively looking at all opportunities to offset this reality, including aggressively ramping up our efforts on additional cost reductions.
And fifth, at Ford credit, we expect auction values to remain strong as supply constraints persist.
However, as I mentioned, we anticipate strong but lower EBT, reflecting primarily the nonrecurrence of reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.
Our results in the quarter, our balance-of-year outlook and commitment to our medium-term targets demonstrate the power of our Ford+ plan as we continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation.
This includes devoting resources to customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification.
We are confident the long-term payback from these investments will be substantial.
So that wraps up our prepared remarks.
We'll use the balance of the time to hear your questions and address what's on your mind.
And so thank you.
Operator, please open the line for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Rod Lache of Wolfe Research.
Please go ahead.
"
2177,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
So hi, Rod.
From a pricing standpoint, so far we have seen pricing just about offset the inflationary pressures that we've seen.
And so, we've been aggressive with top line.
We've been balanced with the incentives.
We do expect the commodity inflation, as Jim said, to continue through the year.
So the pricing that we've taken reflects that.
And so I would say that, we've been aggressive so far starting last year from a pricing standpoint.
I would also say that the dynamic between the volumes and the pricing is going to remain influx.
And as we go through the rest of this year and volumes improve, we have assumed that in the second half you would see increased pressure on your incentives and that's assumed in our guidance.
I would also say Rod that, right now, many of the dealers are transacting near or above MSRP across the industry.
So that has to be a compression that's going to happen first on the pricing front.
And we're watching that very closely.
We've also taken actions where we can improve our pricing by work we've done with our dealers.
So one of the things we did in the quarter is we adjusted our floor plan adjustment to the dealers.
In the past we had paid them one and a half percent of MSRP to cover the floor plan the carrying cost.
And we've adjust that to about 75 days with the actual cost.
So the actually cost of 75 day.
So that's been a benefit that's flowing through our pricing as well.
So we see it as dynamic.
We do agree that as volumes increase, it will be dynamic relative to incentives.
We're not pollyannish about that.
We've reflected what we think is appropriate in the second half relative to incentives to adjust for the volume that we see coming in, but we'll also be aggressive on pricing.
If commodity -- if commodities keep going up, we'll be aggressive as we can.
So I think it's going to be a dynamic play as we go through the rest of the year.
I would say though that when we step back and we look at the pricing relative to 2020 model year -- what we've taken since 2020 model year, we'd have to increase incentives considerably to offset that pricing.
On a run rate basis, they'd have to move from -- I think we're in single-digits -- today low-single-digits.
They have to move up into like 16% -- 15%, 16% to offset that pricing.
So -- and that's back at a time when we had extremely high inventories and we had a very push-through process and we're not going to go back to that.
We're going to be very disciplined with our inventory.
So...
"
2178,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Sure.
On the redesign, there's efficiencies that we're seeing as we work through the redesign across each of the markets that we've restructured.
And so you're starting to see that show up.
There's also some timing differences in there as well where the work we're doing is, let's say, taking a bit longer to get to a solution or a final position with some of the counterparties we're working with.
And we also announced the fact that we will be selling our Craiova facility to Otosan, and that's going to allow to bring cash into that restructuring that we have there as well for global redesign.
So that's the short of it from that standpoint.
The other point -- I think the question was around -- remind me what it was.
"
2179,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes.
Right.
So the lower capex...
"
2180,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yes.
So the lower capex that reflects no change in our intended investment in electrification or our fully networked architecture etc.
It's just timing differences in this year relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year.
So you can still expect us to continually invest.
We have the capital to do that.
The balance sheet's strong.
So it doesn't reflect anything on where we see the business heading.
It's just timing differences for the most part.
"
2181,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yes, it's more of working capital.
Yes.
Absolutely.
"
2182,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yes.
So I think what you see there is exactly that.
There's no change to Ford Credit.
We are seeing higher inflationary pressures.
We are seeing higher top-line pricing that's coming through, but we're also working on cost offsets as well.
So I think it largely remains what we had talked about last time.
We're just seeing higher inflationary pressures and higher pricing flow through.
"
2183,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"No.
I don't think that it's as high as $2.5 billion, Emmanuel.
It's -- there's growth in there, but it's not as high as that.
I think that when you look at the walk relative to what we had provided last time, most of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing are being offset by a combination of additional cost reductions, pricing and mix that's flowing through, but it's not as large as that as what you had just indicated.
"
2184,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yes.
I mean we're not going to parse out the guidance.
It's $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.
It's a dynamic environment.
We're working to offset all the headwinds and maintain the guidance.
But as far as parsing out where we sit within the guidance of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.
And then on the dividends, the dividends are a function of overall profits and balance sheet size and leverage.
And in this case, you heard the guidance on profits and into the balance sheet.
We don't expect much growth this year just given where we are in the vehicle constraints.
So the majority of profits -- we don't have a specific number.
"
2185,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,9,
2186,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Yeah, as a percent of revenue.
And so, we're working costs.
We're working all the angles.
"
2187,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yeah.
We expect those results to continue.
We were in Europe hampered by the supply chain reductions.
But, it was nice to see that even though we were hit by that, Europe did post a better than expected quarter for us.
So we're continuing to do well in commercial vehicles.
We launched the E-Transit, which has been very well received.
Mustang Mach-E has been very well received as well.
So we do expect the business in Europe to continue to improve in the second half as the rate and flow of supply improves for them as well.
"
2188,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Yes.
So John, that's exactly right.
That's what's hitting us from a cash standpoint.
And the inventory increases is for the most part the vehicles on wheels at 53,000 units.
We have a cost for those in our results, but we have no revenue for them.
And as they build out and we complete them in this quarter and into the third quarter, we'll start to get results for that to the bottom line.
And then we're primarily are more profitable vehicles and it's primarily F-Series and Explorer.
So there's definitely an opportunity there that will start to roll through the bottom line once we start shipping those out.
And the reason why -- one of the reasons why we built those John, because the modifications we need to make, we're very confident, we can do that without compromising quality.
But our production is fully subscribed.
So we would have lost these units if we hadn't built them and set them aside until the chips are available.
"
2189,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"No.
The profits aren't recognized in the quarter, right? But the costs, we backed out like for labor etc., that's been all backed out.
That's an inventory.
"
2190,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"Yes.
Colin, thanks for the question.
When we had our Capital Markets Day event, we signaled that we were targeting $1 billion to $2 billion of warranty opportunity by the mid-decade.
In '21, we delivered $1.4 billion of that.
So roughly 70% of that total opportunity.
When you look at Q1 of this year, we had a deterioration.
Some of that was just a non-repeat of items that we recognized in '21 that didn't flow through.
This is still a huge opportunity for us.
It's the No.
1 priority for us as -- for my team, as a skill team is really focusing on improving quality warranty as well as recall performance not only because of the drag on the business, but more importantly, because of the impact on our customers.
So this is something that we're really focused on.
And as Jim and others highlighted earlier, it's a huge opportunity for us to eliminate waste within the company and offset some of those commodity and headwind costs that we discussed earlier.
"
2191,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Yes.
Dan, thanks.
So price is the main offset there for the full year pricing offsetting the inflationary pressures that we're seeing.
We are being very aggressive in ramping up additional cost efforts because we know that this is not going to -- we don't believe that the pressure on cost due to inflationary pressures is going to ease anytime soon.
So we need to find more efficiencies.
We need to improve productivity.
And Jim and the team and we are working very hard on that.
It's a priority for us.
So the other thing that we have is in the second half of the year we do have volumes improving based on the better availability of someway as we see that through the system.
So that's another big driver for us in the year.
And we'll see that in the second half over the first half as that comes online.
So Hau, do you want to talk a little bit about how you're seeing that and what we've been doing to manage that?
"
2192,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"And the other thing I would add is that, the demand, as Jim said earlier is very strong for our new products and that's encouraging for us.
We just can't build enough of them and we see that demand continuing.
"
2193,F,2022,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,17,"The mix assumption is that, we'll revert back to a normal run rate mix that we would expect to see.
We were disproportionately hit in the first quarter by a commodity module and Hau can talk more about that.
He's better to talk about it than I -- than me than I can.
And his -- the team has worked through that.
So we believe we have that resolved.
So we should see a more normal run rate of our mix as we move forward.
"
2194,F,2022,1,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Hi.
Good evening.
Thank you for taking the question.
First question is just on the guidance.
So we know you're maintaining the guide of $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion, but you've also said you're guiding to now $2 billion to $2.5 billion of higher raw mat.
Europe is a choppier environment.
China is a choppier environment.
And then there is also other inflationary pressures that aren't in that raw mat guide.
So I just want to understand what is the full set of offset to that.
You've talked about price, but maybe you could just talk how that compares to maybe other cost offsets that will allow you to maintain your guide despite those incremental headwinds.
"
2195,F,2022,1,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"And the mix assumption within this?
"
2196,F,2022,1,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,2,"Great.
And then my second question is just as we think about the costs that are coming online, I think you've discussed in the past that really in your reorg that Blue is going to be what fund Model E.
So in a good market, it's very easy to see how incremental profits from the core combustion business are funding your EV growth.
But now that we have more costs that are coming into the system maybe you can give us a sense how you're looking at your growth investments.
EV, I assume you're going to invest in that regardless of what the underlying market environment is, but maybe you can give us a sense of are there other growth investments that are maybe more discretionary that you can -- if you need to pull back on or delay.
How do you think about other growth investments?

2199,F,2022,1,doug-field,"chief-officer,-evs-and-digital-systems",False,0,"Sure.
To start with I'm really excited about what we're building off of in Ford strength.
These are cost bases that I'm drooling over in terms of the future products.
But when we talk about EV specifically, the first thing we have to do is really control the battery materials and the chemistry there the single largest build materials opportunity of course but the next is really obsessing over how we use those materials and chemistries.
Energy efficiency is a religion and the team is really stepping up to this.
Every single watt of consumption is now being tracked and optimized.
And on the new programs changes in aerodynamics and drive unit optimization we're seeing dozens of miles of improvement in range.
That's hundreds and even in some cases thousands of dollars of battery that we can take out.
Finally I think really going after a true ground-up approach to how we build EVs.
They're different than internal combustion vehicles.
And you could take advantage of that and really change the number of -- in our next F-Series EV factory we're going to have on the main line half the stations that we use today to build a Lightning.
So I'm very optimistic with this journey that we have some really good ground to make up on margin.
"
2200,F,2022,1,doug-field,"chief-officer,-evs-and-digital-systems",False,1,"No.
Ford, a number of years ago started Ion Park, which is a team of experts really focusing on chemistry.
Lithium-ion phosphate, of course, we know from the industry is something that takes you away from the dependence on nickel.
That will be a part of our battery, and we're also looking chemistries that give us an opportunity to be less dependent on the specific materials that everyone seems to be fighting over in the market.
"
2201,F,2022,1,doug-field,"chief-officer,-evs-and-digital-systems",False,2,"No.
I think that's the right list.
"
2202,F,2022,1,doug-field,"chief-officer,-evs-and-digital-systems",False,3,"Thanks.
Yes.
We did think a lot about this and I had a great partner in Hau to figure out how we were going to take best advantage of Ford's deep capabilities that I have not access to in my prior roles.
So the organization is set up, where Ford Model e can't and doesn't build cars by themselves.
We rely on an industrial platform that does great -- and Ford Model e contribute software -- systems back to Ford Blue.
So there's an interdependency that really helps the team work, I think.
As far as attracting talent, I've been really delighted and surprised by the kind of talent that we can attract from tech.
I think there's a certain amount of fatigue in the tech world and a lot of mature products out there.
The opportunity to work on high technology, but do it in a brand that is so iconic in the United States and something that is so -- such a rich product like a vehicle is really attracting some great people.
Finally, I think from a talent perspective, Ford Model e is also helping us really dig into the internal team and find great people who can step up take on different kinds of roles, be put in positions of authority and really help drive us forward.
There are great people here.

I'm hoping to better understand how Ford is still managing to that 10% to 15% growth? And to what extent is the company taking incremental actions to find different suppliers that perhaps you hadn't been expecting to have to do? And is it more that you're doing those sorts of things to still do 10% to 15% growth, or is it perhaps more about Ford's suppliers not being overly impacted by these recent events? Thank you.

Just two quick ones for me.
First, you did talk about the cadence of earnings before, but just hoping we can revisit it in terms of kind of how to think about the adjusted EBIT for the rest of the year and whether there is any bias at this point toward the low end or high end of your full year guidance range.
And second, more housekeeping question is whether you can provide what you anticipate the Ford Motor Credit dividends to be back up to the parent.

Thanks for taking my question.
As we near the, I think, 180-day lockup expiry on your investment in Rivian, how are you thinking about the options available to you in terms of this investment going forward? Are you maybe more inclined to retain some or all of the stake given the recent decline in Rivian shares? And if you were to monetize it, how are you thinking about the use of any potential proceeds? Could you maybe use them to accelerate your own electrification efforts? Or are you maybe already devoting all the resources necessary there, and so would perhaps look to prioritize other opportunities? I don't know, maybe shareholder-friendly actions.

The short answer is, no.
We're seeing strength in delinquencies.
They're up marginally versus last year but still well below anything we've seen.
And a lot of that's on the back of strong used car values which we expect to remain strong for some period of time.
And you're even getting into the gas price piece of this.
One of the things we've been looking at is whether or not there is a change in auction values by segment.
And we're not seeing any differences in prices or price movements for large SUVs versus smaller sedans.
So the trends continue and we still feel very good about the Credit business.

Let me -- I'll just cover the guidance piece on Ford credit.
We said that the profits will be strong but lower.
And that's reflected in the fact that we had larger reserve releases in 2021 than we would expect in 2022.
In addition to that, we had a lot more supplemental depreciation releases in 2021 than we would in 2022 related to the lease portfolio.

A couple of questions on cash.
I noticed capex is now $7 billion, was -- I think it was $7 billion to $8 billion.
Free cash flow the same.
EBIT still the same.
So is the delta to maintain the free cash flow working capital? And then while we're on cash, it looks like redesign cash is now $1 billion lower this year versus prior.
And I think given the total amount you expect to spend on that is lower now.
So can you just talk about what's going on there?
"
2219,F,2022,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"The lower capex versus prior.

"
2221,F,2022,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,3,"Got it.
And then just the follow-up the free cash flow remains the same is a little bit more of a working capital drag then?
"
2222,F,2022,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,4,"OK.
And then I think you sort of made it quite clear that the primary driver here of covering some of the higher cost is more advantageous pricing.
Can you just parse some of the Ford credit commentary a little bit? Because I think before, you said it was going to be about $1.5 billion lower.
And now there's some language that it's strong but lower.
So is some of that also coming from some of that makeup, if you will, also coming from Ford credit?

So John, last quarter, you provided a very helpful walk toward the 2022 adjusted EBIT with some of the largest puts and takes.
And so I was hoping you can maybe update some of the buckets here.
So obviously, commodities was expected to be $1.5 billion to $2 billion drag.
Now it's $4 billion.
What is now the market factors versus the $6 billion from last time? Ford credit was going to be $1.5 billion balance drag.
I seem to understand from the last question that this hasn't changed.
Any other changes besides market factors? And can you just quantify that?
"
2227,F,2022,1,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"OK.
So versus the $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in the volume mix price benefit from last time, we could basically add $2 billion to $2.5 billion to that, which was the pricing offset -- the cost offset?

I think, John, you said that, in response to Adam's question, that variable costs would come down by at least $1 billion.
But at the same time, you're acknowledging that pricing could easily be more than $1 billion negative for $100 billion North American business with five points of average transaction price decline.
Can you maybe give us a little bit more insight into that? And can you provide a few specific KPIs that would demonstrate progress on structural costs? They were up another $2 billion in 2022.

2232,F,2022,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"So just to put a landmark out there, do you think a year from now we'll be looking at structural costs that are up or down? Obviously, ex pension, because you have this $3 billion cost reduction plan.

Maybe just to switch gears on Model e, if I can ask Jim a question.
You've got this target of 8%.
And that 8% margin target presumably has some assumptions for where costs will go, but also where pricing is going to go.
And just considering everyone's aspirations for growth in EVs, do you think you can stand by those pricing assumptions? And maybe a different way of asking this is, do you think you can sell a $40,000 electric crossover with a 20% gross margin?

2244,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn, and hi, everyone.
We appreciate you all joining us.
I'll start by addressing the obvious.
Our fourth quarter and full year financial performance last year fell short of our potential.
And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues.
These are the simple facts.
And to say I'm frustrated is an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford.
Now, I know the question you must be asking, why Ford with that incredible product lineup, and all the restructuring overseas, why aren't you delivering higher profits and more competitive margins? And it's the right question.
So let me share my perspective.
With Ford+ plan, we are executing a double transformation.
While we're making progress, it's hard work.
As with any transformation of this magnitude, certain parts are moving faster than I expected and other parts are taking longer.
Now, the first part of our transformation is to completely overhaul our industrial system, product development, manufacturing and supply chain management to deliver better cost and quality.
This is critical because it provides the foundation for everything else we do.
It funds our future, that second transformation, which we're aggressively building today.
Building new and incredible new growth businesses like Model e and, of course, Ford Pro are huge bet on commercial vehicles, which will be high-growth, high-margin, not just products but software and services business.
Now, the second transformation, the growth part, is going better than I imagined.
At this point in our journey, I did not expect to be No.
2 in EV sales in the U.S.
I didn't know that Lightning would be completely sold out.
And I didn't predict that BlueCruise would be the best hands-free autonomy system in the market, or the Ford Pro software sales would be growing off the charts.
And that doesn't even touch all the incredible next-generation EVs and software platforms that will soon be entering the market.
Bottom line, in a double transformation, we have to significantly improve our cost and our quality, but at the same time, grow to fulfill that huge promise in Ford+.
And frankly, the first part of the transformation has not moved fast enough.
Now, this is what we should be known for.
It's our legacy, and we'll show we can do it again.
We have deeply entrenched issues in our industrial system that have proven tough to root out.
Candidly, the strength of our products and revenue has masked this functionality for a long time.
It's not an excuse, but it's our reality, and we're dealing with it urgently.
Over the past year, we have made sweeping leadership changes and brought in world-class talent to reenergize and rebuild a leading industrial organization.
We've committed companywide to implement a lean operating system that will scrub billions of dollars of waste out of our company.
And we are shining the light on every inch of our legacy business with knowledge that we must do better every day.
This has been humbling for both me and our team.
That said, I've never been more convinced about our plan.
I cannot wait to get into work every day because I'm so optimistic about our plan and what we are creating here at Ford.
Now, I respect our competition, but I would not trade our places with anyone.
Why? Because we have a real strategy to grow.
We have incredible products, both on the road and the ones you haven't seen in the pipeline.
And I believe we now have a world-class leadership team, made up of new and existing talent ready to compete and win.
These strengths will shine through.
Ultimately, the proof will be in our results.
That's exactly how it should be.
We appreciate those who place their faith in Ford, and we are committed to creating value for all of our stakeholders.
So with that, let me quickly cover some areas of focus.
First, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation.
And you saw this in the actions we took in Brazil and India and most recently in Argo.
And now South America and IMG are healthy and generating sustainable profits.
This work is never done and will continue to be the focus for us going forward.
Our balance sheet liquidity remains strong, and our ability to generate free cash flow has really improved significantly.
And this is allowing us to accelerate our investment in growth, of course, electrification, but also Pro and software while, importantly, also returning capital to our shareholders.
And we now have created three distinct customer-facing business segments: Blue, e and Pro, which have given us greater clarity and insights into each of these businesses and how we can improve each of them uniquely.
So let me cover a couple of highlights.
I'm going to start with Pro, my favorite, the not-so-secret weapon at Ford.
Ford Pro embodies all of our growth levers, and it capitalizes on our commercial vehicle sales leadership and scale to build a world-class ecosystem that delivers great value to our customers and profitable growth for us at Ford.
In North America, our vehicle share is almost twice that of our closest competitor.
And in Europe, Ford has been the No.
1 vehicle brand -- commercial vehicle brand for eight years in a row.
Let me bring this point home.
Here in North America home market, Super Duty, our most important Pro vehicle, owns half the mining business.
It owns half the emergency response business and half the utility business.
And the requirements for all these customers are complex.
They're not going to commoditize, and they require a partner who deeply understands these unique businesses and is dedicated to providing a mix of vehicles, but also services that can improve uptime and total cost of ownership.
And we know these customers will pay for software that will enhance their productivity.
Now, we're going to future-proof this business by leading the commercial electrification solutions as well, both at E-Transit and F-150 Lightning today.
E-Transit is already America's top-selling electric van, with 73% market share.
60% of all of our U.S.
fleet managers plan to add an electric vehicle within the next two years to their fleet.
And that's even before the $7,500 IRA tax credit that was announced and applies irregardless of the location of raw materials of batteries.
This year, Pro really gets going.
We introduced our most important vehicle gets refreshed, the new Super Duty Pickup.
And in Europe, the Super Duty equivalent, we have an all-new 1-Tonne Transit.
And Ford Pro's high-margin software business will continue to grow, especially software for fleet management, telematics and charging.
Last year, these subscriptions for software grew over 70%, reflecting new software offerings, better platform for our software and contracts and growth in fleet charging attach rates, which are close to 50% now.
We're also increasing our sales of parts and services via a network of 1,000 mobile service vehicles on the road in North America and Europe and over 1,400 specialized commercial vehicle dealerships, many of which open 24/7.
In fact, last year, mobile service repair orders increased 85% for us in Pro.
And this improves the customer experience while importantly increasing the attach rates of our high-margin parts business.
Now, moving to Blue.
The team is focused and has delivered the freshest and most appealing product lineup in our industry.
We know that, typically, the fresher the ICE portfolio, the greater the pricing power.
So our decision to move away from sedans and commoditized utilities to vehicles like Bronco Sport and the Big Bronco, the Maverick, the Puma in Europe and hybrid powertrains has really paid off.
Ford gained nearly one point of market share here in the U.S.
last year, and we expect 2023 to be another big, strong year of share growth.
Ford Blue is a growth business for the foreseeable future, with strong profits and robust free cash flow.
And F-Series was America's best-selling truck for 46 consecutive year now, outselling its second-place competitor by more than 140,000 trucks.
We're launching even new pickups like the new Ranger here in North America and in South America after we've already launched the new Ranger in Asia and Europe last year.
In addition, Blue is going after billions of cost improvements from engineering to manufacturing to our bill of material.
And in quality, we have work to do.
Ford has been the No.
1 in recalls in the U.S.
for the last two years.
Clearly, that's not acceptable.
We've overhauled our entire enterprise quality operating system.
And we are already seeing improvements in initial quality for vehicles coming out of our plants here in North America.
And Model e.
It's operating with a start-up intensity to build profitable EVs with differentiated industry-leading portfolios that customers are going to love.
In the U.S., our EV sales growth is twice the rate of the EV segment and more than 60% of our Model e customers are new to Ford.
The F-150 Lightning has been America's best-selling electric pickup since it launched.
And the Mustang Mach-E remains a huge hit for our customers.
We remain on track to reach our annualized EV production capacity of 50,000 units per month or 600,000 units globally by the end of this year.
For reference, in the fourth quarter, our run rate of production was more like 12,000.
So 50,000 is a big growth.
And by the end of -- and we are on plan for that 2 million units of incremental capacity by the end of 2026.
Now, to deliver this incredible growth, as we speak, throughout facilities in North America, we're adding shifts, expanding our facilities, building out new battery capacity and assembly capacity.
Construction is in full swing in Tennessee and Kentucky on our BlueOval City and our three BlueOval SK battery plants.
And in Europe, we're moving ahead with a new commercial vehicle battery facility in Turkey.
Now, critical to our plan is securing the necessary raw materials for these batteries to get to that 2 million unit rate, especially lithium and lithium hydroxide and nickel.
We expect to have 100% of raw materials we need for the 2 million unit run rate secured by the end of this year.
Now, we are deep in the development of our second-generation EVs, including our next-generation electric full-size pickup, which, by the way, is awesome.
These EVs will be fully software-updatable.
That means a brand-new electric architecture, and they're going to be radically simplified.
Imagine three body styles, each with volume potential of up to 1 million units and just a handful of orderable combinations.
That's what we're doing at Ford for the second generation of products.
And that means higher customer sat, better quality, lower bill of material and lower manufacturing cost.
When we start reporting according to these new segments in the fourth quarter, you're going to have complete visibility in the Model e's margin trajectory and understand the key levers to achieve our Model e EBIT target of 8%.
We're already making the customer-buying experience better with less friction.
Now, this is only going to accelerate when the new Model e dealer program takes effect in January next year.
This program has been adopted by nearly two thirds of our 3,000 U.S.
dealers, and it's based on a radical redesign on our customer experience.
Next January, we'll be selling EVs in high volume with virtually no inventory, a simple e-commerce platform for our customers, non-negotiated price set by the local dealer and remote pickup and delivery for all customer experiences.
We're also expanding BlueOval charging network at all of our dealers.
And we'll have dealer staff trained not only on software but all the EVs.
Now, I've said before, software and experiences will be the key differentiator for our industry.
I mentioned earlier that BlueCruise, our driver-assist, hands-free technology, was just tested by Consumer Reports and judged the best hands-free autonomous system on the market.
Let that sink in for a while.
The best on the market.
Now, have you not experienced BlueCruise, I challenge you to go out and do your side-by-side comparison with our two major competitors.
And at the end of last year, our customers using BlueCruise have now traveled 42 million hands-free miles.
So we're scaling incredibly rapidly.
That's a fourfold increase in the millions of miles since the second quarter of last year.
And we have incredible software talent, making this system better every day, including those 600 former Argo engineers who are now working full time at Ford on our autonomous systems.
Now, before I hand it over to John, just a few things.
Ford is a different company today.
We're all about building a stronger customer-focused business that generate sustainable profitable growth and returns above the cost of capital.
While our 2022 results fell short of my expectations, I've never been more excited about our future because we have the right plan, the right structure to succeed, the best team on the field and real strategic clarity.
This year is about execution.
It's time for us to deliver, and we will with relentless attention to our founding principles, drift and growth, and we are hitting the ground running.
John?
"
2245,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thanks, Adam.
No, there's a lot more to go.
And the industrial system at Ford is a huge opportunity for us.
And we have spent the last several months really getting deep on where we need to go.
So John, maybe you could share or feeling comfortable on sharing, but you're going to hear a drumbeat from Ford on this all during the year.
"
2246,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"I think on the demand side, we see the U.S.
around the 15 million range, Europe around 13 million.
We're going to see more incentives in the U.S.
So we can go through the demand side if that's what you're interested in.
"
2247,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"On the software side, we were guessing before, but now we kind of know what the first three shippable large TAM software revenue sources are for our industry.
The first is partial autonomy, the second is safety and security and the third is productivity.
And the star people in there, the early leaders, definitely ADAS, on pricing revenue growth.
I mean, the growth we're seeing, the demand we're seeing for BlueCruise and all ADAS features is really driving a lot of software shipment.
We're about to ship our second cycle of BlueCruise already, and we are really starting to see -- that is clearly what customers want revenue-wise.
And I do believe in this first three, four years of software to the car that ADAS, that Level 2, Level 3 system is really the most remarkable TAM.
However, in the background, for Ford, the productivity software in Pro is really important.
It's maybe unique to us, but it is a very important part of our software revenue, which we will lay out in May.
You'll see more specifics on it, but it's very profitable.
The customers love the data, and they have a higher demand for the data and the software than the retail customer.
I think the slow burn, the one in the background that I'm super excited about is the third leg of the stool, the safety and security.
Not like someone stole your car, but it's video content, a lot of it tied to insurance.
So this is going to be a really interesting area.
Kind of think of your cars and extension of your ring and all the safety and security you have in your house now, all that technology, the cars give me another note on that.
It will go for everything from teenage drivers to all sorts of things.
And that video capture is going to be the essence.
Another reason why we think our next electrical architecture is so strategically important for the company because we want to embed that hardware and software and adaptability in the electric architecture so we can ship the software, better software than our competition on safety and security, even if it's a little fuzzy on what the features are today.
"
2248,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,
2249,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"And Adam, I'd just like to add, as the CEO, there's a lot of choices.
They're all very consequential when it comes to the approach to do this.
The most important thing for me is sustainable.
When you look at Ford, we have cut in the past, and it grows back.
Or we have cut everywhere and not really focused on the industrial system.
So for me, the approach that we're taking that's very different and very difficult is that it has to be daily work, gaps to competition, countermeasures, action plans for those countermeasures, constant evaluation of the effectiveness of those countermeasures, celebration of those KPIs and our status and daily management.
It has to be a more fundamental approach than holding our breath or dealing with the output like people and getting into the real industrial system's efficiency.
And that is a cultural change as a leader.
It's a behavioral change.
It is not just a program.
"
2250,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
"
2251,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"No, you hit on it.
And I'm glad we're getting into some of the strategies.
I mean, I would think of China business similar to what we've done in South America and IMG.
Small but profitable, focused.
We've been, in the past, in China kind of small but focused on everything.
And Lincoln and our commercial with JMC is very profitable and an important business, but they have to make the EV transition.
And I don't think you can be globally successful in the EV business if you don't compete with the Chinese.
I mean, they're going to come to Europe.
They're already there.
They're going to come to the U.S.
BYD is a powerhouse, Geely, there's so many others.
And so, we believe China is very strategically important for us.
But to win there, we have to make those businesses transition profitably to EV, but I would think of it as kind of small and focused, maybe even more than the past.
And Europe is definitely -- we have a great CV business, commercial vehicle business, that now is getting electrified.
So we're like making that transition now.
We have a new Ranger, the electric version of Transit, 1-Tonne Transit.
And all of them, we have a new manufacturing site in Romania that's really scaling up now in commercial.
So we have a really strong business.
And the decision really is how much do we need, how much -- how many engineers, how many people do we need in Europe and how big of a profile do we need in passenger cars? That's the decision.
We've already electrified Cologne, and that's really the decision.
It's not the right time to talk about where we're going to go, but we know exactly our strength in Europe, and we know what we need to do.
So -- and you won't have to wait long to hear from us on these things.
"
2252,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Sure.
Thanks, John.
Operator
The next question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
Please go ahead.
"
2253,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Rod, some of the things I think about -- some of the things I think about is a number of complex sequencing centers we have.
Our line side complexity, number of parts sitting on the side of the line, our inventory turns inside the plant.
And on the supplier side, it's going to be transparency.
We had full transparency down to Tier 3 in our supply chain.
It's very important to operationalize better quality and cost.
On the engineering side, it's also indirect.
What's the ratio of indirect to direct engineering that we're spending, i.e., the productive engineering that's resulting in customer-facing products.
And increasingly, I know it's going to sound a little bit weird, but it's the software output.
We are spending, as a management team, more and more time on our software platform and the cost of creating software and the complexity of software.
And that's something that -- we have a lot of KPIs.
They're increasing quickly and are increasingly important for us.
It may not be significant for structural cost, but we have to be careful to add a lot of complexity in software.
"
2254,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"That is a very important question.
The reality is we will -- we are structuring our portfolio to compete in very specific segments.
The two-row crossover is turning out to be the core civic of the EV business.
And the last thing we want to do is commoditize our products by dropping the price.
Just look what happened to Henry Ford in the 20s, in the early teens.
And that's exactly what we're seeing play out here.
We didn't have to touch the pricing and offer Lightning and E-Transit because we pick the right segments.
But the real driver of our future profitability on Model e is the second-cycle products.
We didn't know when we designed these first three products.
We didn't know that our wiring harness for Mach-E was 1.6 kilometers longer than it needed to be.
We didn't know it's 70 pounds heavier, and that that's worth $300 of battery.
We didn't know that we underinvested in braking technology to save on the battery size.
We didn't know that we needed the world's best aerodynamics to get the size of the battery smaller.
And so, now we have learned a lot and that second cycle of the product is in the factory right now being developed with a lot of new talent.
So I'm very optimistic about our 8% because we are not going to be playing in the two-row commodity SUV market because that's -- because Ford's tried that in the ICE business It didn't really work out for us.
We want to play our hand, our strength, commercial, truck, larger vehicles on the category side.
We do not want to have too many top hats because that costs a lot to engineer.
We want to have minimum choice for customers, but we want to design the smallest possible battery for competitive size.
And we want to invest differently in our ICE business for radical simplification.
30%, 40%, 50% less fasteners, no brackets in the vehicle.
I can go on and on.
We'll get into it at Capital Markets Day.
I think we should expect all brands to protect growth when it comes to EV.
And that, or we have to expect negative pricing.
And that means software and other items like that becoming even more critical.
And I can't wait to show you our new electric architecture because, to me, that's the most critical strategic investment the company is making, not our batteries, not the EV platforms, but our new fully updatable electric architecture.
Because what we've learned on Pro is we can make real money on software.
"
2255,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Right.
Yes, great question.
We're going to see that on Pro first, and this year is a breakout year for Pro because we have brand-new products, both core in Europe and U.S.
are most -- the highest-volume, the highest-profit vehicles are all new.
So a very important year for us.
I would say we absolutely have a fantastic business plan that's very specific about software and physical services.
The biggest opportunity for us in the short term is the aftersales business.
Only 10% of our Pro customers do business with us, and we hardly do any financing with them.
And so, between financing and parts and service, we have enormous upside in the short term.
And those are very profitable parts of our business.
So I would think of it this way, Ryan.
It's like software is starting to drive a closed loop where the customer wants to do more physical service with us.
We have all those mobile units, more and more dedicated dealers and more of our commercial customers because of the use of the software is coming back and buying parts for us.
And then, the next level of performance is really going to be prognostics.
When we could put predictive failure in all the vehicles, like you see on John Deere and Caterpillar, and then drive that into our physical repair facilities, we're going to see a much larger retention in parts and service.
So I think the basics of the business are, these are profitable vehicles.
We've got new ones coming out.
We're going to grow that.
We're -- I mean, we blew through our parts and service profits and revenue for Pro last year.
It's almost like we can't even predict as this -- that software starts to really drive a different behavior for our customers, the growth in parts and service.
But that's the monetization in the short term for these services in the integrated ecosystem.
And then long term, the real game changer kind of like autonomy in the retail space is going to be that prognostics.
"
2256,F,2022,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"On the regions?
"
2257,F,2022,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Hi.
Good evening, guys.
Just kind of wanted to follow up sort of on a similar vein, short term and long term.
Just for short term, when we think about the '23 outlook and you look at the $1.4 billion decline in Ford Credit and take that as a reasonably given number, something in that direction, and then $2 billion of lower past service pension income, that's a $3.4 billion headwind.
But sort of at the midpoint of the range, you're talking about EBIT being roughly flat.
So that sort of indicates a very significant $3 billion-plus improvement in the core business, which is a lot to kind of believe when you're looking at sort of the headwinds and the issues that you just faced.
I'm just curious if you can comment on that and maybe kind of walk us to how we get comfortable like that we'll see a $3 billion-plus improvement in the core business this year.
I mean -- and how do you get these supply chain issues fixed when some of that are a bit outside of your control and what we hear from suppliers is volatility and schedules.
And it's not just specific to Ford, still pretty volatile.
"
2258,F,2022,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"OK.
That's actually incredibly helpful.
And just on the long term, I mean, you mentioned, Jim, about scrubbing things foundationally and really getting to some costs that are excess.
And I appreciate the three areas you've highlighted.
But as we look around the world, I mean, Europe is -- had fits and starts of making us all kind of excited that it's going to work and then it doesn't from time to time.
And China, you kind of been chasing competition there, and it hasn't really paid out for you.
But there are two very important parts of Europe and China that are very strong for you.
Commercial vehicle in Europe is incredibly strong.
So could we just strip Europe back to pure commercial vehicle? And could China just strip back to pure Lincoln? Two places we know you're making money and cut out the other stuff so that you can actually fund the transition that you're talking about.
I mean, just -- we kind of all dance around this stuff, and you've headed in this direction with the global redesign, but there's real opportunities here to be really profitable.
"
2259,F,2022,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"OK, I've got more, but I'll get back in the queue.
Thank you very much, guys.
I appreciate it.
"
2260,F,2022,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,
2261,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Jim.
As Jim pointed out, our performance in 2022 was below our expectations, and our industrial platform is frankly not where we need it to be.
The simple way I measure this is by looking at our cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue and then compare it to our competition.
We've all done it, we're much higher.
And this speaks to the significant operating deficits we have in product development, manufacturing and procurement.
And this is no different from the tough capital allocation choices we made upon our geographic footprint and product portfolio.
Choice is designed to yield higher quality growth and improved returns.
And we are now applying that same level of discipline to our industrial platform with urgency.
Now, on the positive side, our product portfolio has never been stronger.
Our new vehicles are a hit with our customers.
Our iconic vehicles remain market leaders, and we continue to make strategic and capital allocation decisions to drive growth, strengthen our competitive position and produce returns above our cost of capital.
So turning to the year.
We generated a record $9.1 billion in free cash flow, well above our cash conversion target of 50% to 60%.
And importantly, most of the free cash flow came from the Automotive business.
And this reflects more disciplined capital allocation, including the restructuring of our operations outside of North America, which, until recently, was a significant source of cash burn.
Now, our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the year with $32 billion of cash and $48 million of liquidity.
This, coupled with the improvement in free cash flow, provides us with ample flexibility to both fund our growth and return capital to our shareholders.
In fact, today, we declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share, as well as a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share, reflecting our strong free cash flow and the monetization of our Rivian stake, which is now nearly complete.
Going forward, we intend to target distributions of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, consistent with our focus on total shareholder return.
Now, for the year, we delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.6%.
And as Jim said, by better executing the things we control, we should have generated as much as $2 billion more in adjusted EBIT.
For example, the instability of our supply chain and production plans caused us to not only deliver lower-than-planned volumes in the fourth quarter but also incur higher costs through premium freight and other supplier charges.
Now, let me give you a quick overview of how our '22 segments performed, recognizing that beginning with our first quarter 2023 results will no longer have the Automotive segments with regional breakouts.
Now, North America delivered $9.2 billion of EBIT, an improvement of $1.8 billion, driven by higher net pricing and increased volume, which was partially offset by higher commodities and other inflation-related cost increases.
EBIT margin was 8.4%.
We continue to maintain a healthy order bank.
And the team is busy preparing the launch of the all-new Super Duty and our seventh generation Mustang later this year, and both of those are incredible products.
In South America, we delivered a profit of over $400 million, and the region is now derisked and sustainably profitable.
In Europe, we were slightly above breakeven for the year.
But as our fourth quarter results showed clearly below our target.
Given the changing macroeconomic environment and demand environment in Europe, we will make the changes necessary to deliver a sustainable business that consistently generates returns above our cost of capital.
Our core strength in the region continues to be our leading commercial vehicle business.
In China, we posted a loss of about $600 million, driven by increased investment in EVs.
Lincoln continues to be our profit pillar in the region, but clearly, we have more work to do to ensure our business is growing, sustainable and delivering appropriate returns.
Our International Markets Group earned more than $600 million, driven by the launch of the all-new Ranger and our decision to exit India.
And similar to South America, the region is now primed for sustainable profitability.
And finally, Ford Credit had another solid year, delivering EBT of $2.7 billion, which was down $2.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin and lower lease return rates.
Now, given the continued uncertainties in the macro environment, I want to provide some context to how we're thinking about 2023.
For the full year, we expect to earn $9 billion to $11 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that assumes a SAAR of 15 million units in the U.S.
and 13 million units in Europe.
We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and for capital expenditures to be between $8 billion to $9 billion.
Our adjusted EBIT guidance includes various headwinds and tailwinds and that we believe could impact our business in the coming year.
And for example, when you think about the headwinds, they include an expected mild recession in the U.S.
and a moderate recession in Europe; higher industry incentives as supply and demand come back into balance; Ford Credit EBT of about $1.3 billion, and that's about $1.4 billion lower than in 2022, reflecting unfavorable lease residual and credit losses and the nonreoccurrence of derivative gains.
We expect a continued strong dollar.
We also expect about $2 billion lower past service pension income.
And we're also going to continue investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services and capex as we build out our growth plan.
Now, tailwinds include improvements in supply chain and industry volume, launch of our all-new Super Duty and then, of course, lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of our industrial platform.
Now, before taking questions, let me briefly touch on our new financial reporting, as well as plans for our next Capital Markets Day.
On March 23, we'll hold a teach in at the New York Stock Exchange.
And I'm really excited about this opportunity because it will be our chance to take you through how the new Ford+ segment will alter our financial reporting.
The changes will include how revenue, cost products and assets are assigned to each segment.
At the teach in, we'll also share our recast financials for both 2021 and 2022, and we hope many of you join us at the New York Stock Exchange in person.
But we will also broadcast a webcast live and we'll be -- and we'll post a toolkit and other materials to orient you around all the materials and help you migrate your models.
Now, the teach in will not be a strategic update.
That will come at our Capital Markets Day in Dearborn in May, when we'll update you on our Ford+ strategy.
We'll do a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our new segments, as well as for software and services.
Now, with this new level of transparency, which will be tracked and validated in our earnings materials and SEC filings, we think investors will be better equipped to value how each of our customer-focused segments is contributing to Ford's overall growth and return profile.
And as Jim mentioned earlier, 2023 is a pivotal year for Ford.
We have the plan, the talent and the product portfolio in place to take the company to an exciting new level, one that is both differentiated from our past performance and our competitors.
And going forward, our new segmentation will provide unprecedented levels of transparency and insight into all aspects of our business, making it easier to hold Ford leadership accountable for delivering superior growth and value for all of our stakeholders.
Now, that wraps up the prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds.
So thank you.
And operator, please open up the line for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
"
2262,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yes.
So Adam, I think if you just step back and look at the three elements of the industrial platform, there's opportunities across each.
If you look at our product development system and in our engineering, the level of productivity that we have, so think about $1 of input and what you get out for that $1 of input is probably about 25% to 30% inefficient.
So we should be either getting more product through the pipeline or our cost should be significantly lower.
Now, we have to be very smart about how we go about doing that because we've got incredible products in the pipeline, and there's a huge opportunity on that front, but we also have to balance the quality as well.
And so, when it comes to our engineering, I think you should think about it that way, and that's what we're going after.
Our supply chain, there are issues across the supply chain.
It cost us, as we talked about last year, at least $1 billion in premiums that we had to pay, increased freight, premiums on chips, premiums on disruption that we called our suppliers because our schedule stability was probably worst in class.
And fixing that and the root cause it gets to that will drive incredible opportunities for us.
And let's say that for 2023, it should be at least an incremental $1 billion, at least.
And then, when you look at our manufacturing system and you go through our plants, you look at the level of working capital we have in, you look at our production schedules, you look at the complexity and what it does for time that takes us to build a vehicle.
And you understand just how inefficient that is.
And then, you bring that back through that -- complexity back through the supply chain.
And you talked about the number of changeovers that our suppliers have to make to produce the complexity that we have and the time that it adds to production and the time that it adds the cost and the issues that it drives through.
So those are just some of the tip of the iceberg or the things we're going after.
And then, if you go back and you look at it, as I said in my remarks, just you look at the math and you look at our cost of goods sold relative to our revenue and then compare that to traditional OEMs, let alone the new OEMs, and you see the size of the prize that we're going after.
And what's changed, Adam, I think the answer is, is we just have to show you guys.
I mean, that's where we're at.
We have to deliver it.
But as Jim said, as we're taking this lean approach and getting into it, there's a very systematic way we're going at it now, and we are very focused.
And we know that this is the No.
1 thing that needs to get fixed in the first part of our transformation.
"
2263,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yes.
So --

2264,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes.
I think what we would have to say is that, given that we're moving to our segments for 2023, we're not going to be reporting the regions.
And so, we will give more color on 2023 by each of the business unit segments.
And so, I'm not going to comment on regions anymore going forward, unless there's a specific reason to do that within one of the segments.
"
2265,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yes.
I think in Europe, we're going to see continued pressure on the top line.
We've got a 13 million unit in the industry.
We think we still have such a strong order bank.
We -- not think, we know we have a strong order bank on our commercial vehicles that we don't see as much pressure there.
More of the pressure will come on the passenger side.
But pricing in Europe, incentives continue to be strong throughout this year.
So I don't think you'll see as much price compression in Europe, as you've seen in -- you'll see in North America and the U.S.
But I think, definitely for Europe, it's the call on the industry and where do we think that will be, offset by the strength of the order bank we have on our commercial vehicles.
Coming back to the U.S., as we said, a 15 million unit industry.
We think prices are going to come and the industry are going to fall -- transaction prices will fall about 5%.
If you think about that, it's about the combination of incentives and lower dealer margins.
We're starting to see dealer margins come down now as our demand from the industry is easing a bit.
And we're starting to see the inflationary costs come through with the pricing.
And so, we're starting to see those margins come off.
And I think, as we go through the year, particularly in the second half, you'll start to see prices come down through higher incentives by the OEMs.
When you look at our International Markets Group, I think it's a little bit different there.
Our key product is Ranger, and that's all new, and that's launching, and so there's incredible demand for it.
And so, we think we have some pricing power there as well.
So I think there's puts and takes around the region, if you look at it on a macro basis.
And I think it will be more insightful as we talk about what's happening in each of the segments and then specifically what's happening in Pro, Blue and e in those segments around the world.

2267,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Thanks, Jim.
Thanks, John.
We'll, connect later.
Appreciate it.
"
2268,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yes.
Thanks, John.
It's a great question.
That's exactly it.
The headwinds are $4.5 billion to $5 billion, as we pointed out.
And we said we expect on the tailwinds, our pricing to be about neutral.
The market forces, I think, are going to drive average transaction prices down, we think probably around 5%.
And that will come some from the dealer margins, but also from higher incentives.
And then, you step back from it and we do have the new Super Duty.
And we expect that to be a positive, and we also have a very strong order bank on our commercial vehicles.
So we're looking at pricing being about flattish.
We said volumes, there's a slight opportunity as industry comes along.
So the rest of it falls into cost reductions, and that's exactly right.
When you look at those cost reductions, you have to see what's happening relative to the material.
And in material, there's two phases there.
There's one, it's -- we do expect commodity prices to come off a bit, to improve a bit.
But we also have significant opportunities in our material cost, and we have several initiatives going on to identify those efficiencies.
We also have quite a bit of cost when you talk about schedule stability.
I don't have the exact data from the competition, but when I look at our schedule stability, there are significant opportunities through changes that we can take to improve that schedule stability, which will flow straight through to lower surcharges from the supply base because they have to deal with that instability and there's cost that that drives, as well as the significant premiums we paid in freight for expedite, air freight, etc., to just try to keep plants going and keep our suppliers' plants going.
So those are two immediate actions that we can take based on the inefficiencies we saw in '22 that cost us the $2 billion.
And then, on top of that, we have to build through the core industrial platform just productivity and efficiencies to drive even more improvements.
So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's how we're going about it.
"
2269,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yes.
So on the pricing, we do see the broad market coming in at about -- transaction prices falling about 5%.
Some of that's going to come out of the dealer margins, of course.
It's not all going to come from us.
But we also have upside, Rod, with some of the launch of the new vehicles.
We won't see as much of a price compression there.
So we see pricing net-net for us next year being about flattish.
And so, don't think about it as we're working through '23 as being a negative $1 billion.
And then, I would say that when it comes to the cost reductions, I think what we've got to start showing is, one, that we're getting leverage out of the business.
If we're growing the business, that our cost of goods sold is growing at a much slower pace.
And that as we're coming out with new vehicles, our cost per units are coming down, so our margins are improving.
When you look at the design of our vehicles and you compare it to competition, I think if you go through those benchmarks and you go through those teardowns, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to design out complexity.
And you should see that coming through complexity-reduction KPIs on our vehicles.
I think that will be key.
And it not only will be in the order combinations but also in the parts complexity, in the number of parts.
And what we'll be doing is, as we move forward through this year, especially at Capital Markets Day, we'll be providing more details on those KPIs.
But it's the key areas.
You should be seeing how much productivity we're getting out of $1 of engineering.
And we should do something around that from a KPI standpoint because these are the areas that we need to improve.
"
2270,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Rod, I think it's beyond just structural cost.
Our biggest cost element is our material cost.
We will continue to invest in our growth-related investments.
So connected services, the software, as Jim talked about.
We're also continuing to invest, as you know, in our build-out of our batteries.
So our spending-related costs are going to go up.
Volume will drive manufacturing cost, which is in our structural cost.
So there will be puts and takes on the structural costs.
Our biggest opportunity is in our level of material cost that we have.
It's the largest cost element on our income statement, and it's where we are most uncompetitive.
"
2271,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"So we're going after everything, but I --
"
2272,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yes.
I think it comes down to the key driver for the miss in the fourth quarter was the volumes.
And the volumes was on availability of key commodities, primarily chips, and the fact that many of our suppliers had equipment issues as they were ramping.
We think we've worked through a lot of those issues on the ramp in our supply chain.
And as far as the rate inflow on the commodities, the chips, it continues to be hand-to-hand combat.
But we're putting corrective actions in place.
We've got better pipelines from brokers and spot buys.
And we're working very closely with our supply chain down to the Tier 2 chip suppliers.
So that's execution.
It's changes that we're putting in place on the rate and flow, and it's being more efficient in our scheduling and the stability of our production to reduce expedited freight, expedited costs at our supply chain, etc.
So part of it's operational.
Part of it's what we're doing working with our supply chain partners.
And part of it is getting through the hump on ramping up run rates, etc., throughout the system.
"
2273,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Right.
So if you look at that, it's at least $2.5 billion, depending on where we fall within the range of the guidance.
So I think that would be a start point, and then we would go from there.
And of course, we're going to be working to do better than that.
But that's what we see so far.
"
2274,F,2022,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"Yes.
"
2275,F,2022,4,itay-michaeli,citi,True,0,"Hi.
Great.
Thanks.
Good evening, everyone.
Just two questions for me.
First, I was hoping you could maybe talk about the regional outlook in your 2023 guidance.
I don't know that the segments are about to change, but hoping you could touch on the regions.
And then, second, maybe for Jim.
When we're thinking about the software opportunity on your new electrical architecture on the consumer side of the business, where do you see the biggest opportunity there from a revenue perspective? Is it automated driving? Is it connected services? Just curious what is most interesting there.
"
2276,F,2022,4,itay-michaeli,citi,True,1,"Yes, sure.
That would be helpful.
Yes.
Maybe pricing in Europe would be helpful as well.

2279,F,2022,4,james-picariello,exane-bnp-paribas,True,0,"Hi, guys.
So the third quarter negative pre-announcement had a narrative around it, right? It was very high mix on wheels inventory that you couldn't ship and the additional $1 billion of supplier costs.
I know Adam hit on this in his question, but this quarter is missing that storyline.
I know it was mentioned that you have line of sight to $2 billion in profit that you left on the table.
But what could really turn around almost immediately in this first quarter in '23 here in terms of like what operational mishaps you know will reverse in the coming months and quarter, whatever the time frame might be?
"
2280,F,2022,4,james-picariello,exane-bnp-paribas,True,1,"OK.
Understood.
That's helpful.
And then, in terms of the earnings bridge for this year, with respect to materials and freight, that $9 billion headwind in '22.
I know you mentioned you're breaking in commodity prices to come down.
But all in, relative to that $9 billion this past year, what's assumed in the '23 guide here on this line item?
"
2281,F,2022,4,james-picariello,exane-bnp-paribas,True,2,"So at least $2.5 billion positive?

Welcome to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2022 earnings call.
With me today are Jim Farley, our president and CEO; and John Lawler, our chief financial officer.
Also joining us for Q&A are Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit; and Doug Field, chief advanced product development and technology officer for Ford Model e.
Today's discussions include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S.
GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck.
You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations.
Actual results may differ from those stated.
The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 23.
Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year.
Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted.
Looking at our IR calendar, we have two upcoming engagements.
Tomorrow, Bank of America will host a fireside chat with John Lawler and Lisa Drake, our VP of EV industrialization and manufacturing engineering for Ford Model e.
On November 7th, tech analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, will host a fireside chat with Doug Field at the AllianceBernstein's Electric Revolution Conference in London.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley.

2286,F,2022,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
I wanted to just ask about vehicle pricing.
Jim, you've always had a pretty good read on seeing the market through the consumers' lens.
And obviously, average transaction prices are up a lot.
And now, rates are going up, and trade-in values are starting to come off the peak.
Can you maybe just give us your thoughts about affordability and this interplay between price and volume and inventory starts to normalize? It'd be helpful if you had any thoughts on kind of the magnitude of price normalization that we might see over the next year or two?
"
2287,F,2022,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"Thanks for that.
And maybe just switching gears, Marion, I'm trying to understand your implicit guidance for Ford Credit.
You brought the full year down a little bit, at least it optically looks that way from around 3 billion to 2.7 billion.
But now Q4 looks like it's quite low.
I was wondering if you might be able to give us some color on where you expect to end the year in terms of loss reserves.
At one point, you had, I think, post-COVID, taken the reserves up to 1.2% of managed receivables.
Is that sort of something that you're -- that's implicit in these numbers? Or is there anything else in there that's driving that level of profitability?

2290,F,2022,3,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan-chase-and-company,True,0,"Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
Are you able to dimension for us how much of the $1 billion of higher-than-expected supplier-related inflation costs incurred in 3Q actually relate to in-period expenses incurred by suppliers versus how much might represent a catch-up of prior period cost? To know that I think would help with understanding what portion of this headwind in 3Q that we should model as continuing into 2023 versus how much might be more onetime in nature.
"
2291,F,2022,3,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan-chase-and-company,True,1,"OK.
Very helpful.
And lastly, I think at the time of the 2Q call, you considered it a bit too early to say whether commodity costs are likely to be a tailwind or a headwind next year.
But with the subsequent decline now in spot prices, are you more confident that commodities are likely to be a tailwind? And are you able to dimension at all that tailwind or maybe compare it directionally in magnitude to the headwinds that you're likely to face when it comes to noncommodity supply chain costs, which do not seem to be, you know, deflating similar to commodities?

Hi, everyone.
We really appreciate you being with us today.
We introduced the Ford+ Plan for growth and value creation two years ago, and the investment thesis had three drivers: leveraging our iconic vehicles, our strengths, both geographically and nameplates; number two, add to that, integrated hardware, software, and connectivity into those vehicles; and then expand the total addressable market and unlocking value with Conquest EVs, new commercial vehicles, connected services and physical services, as well as mobility.
So, today, I'd like to share a progress report on Ford's transformation; of course, update you on our autonomy strategy and our announcement; and, of course, recap the quarter.
Our ambition to be the leader in EV is already taking shape.
In our home market, Ford Model e is now -- has now had incredible successful launch of three products.
They're now in scaling, F-150 Lightning, Mach-E, and E-Transit.
And each are attracting, interesting for us, almost all new customers.
So, this is growth.
We're now the No.
2 electric brand in the U.S., and we're just beginning with our scaling.
Our decision to create Blue for both ICE and hybrid vehicles has focused and energized our team to leverage what we do best at Ford.
We have launched a string of hits that our products -- our customers not only love but have lined up to buy.
And we have so many more exciting products to come.
We have made tough capital allocation and restructuring decisions like the one today, particularly in South America and our international market groups, like India.
And our results and cash flow, you could see in our results, have improved dramatically.
Our balance sheet remained strong.
We ended the quarter with nearly $50 billion in liquidity, even as we accelerate investments in connectivity and electrification.
And what is, perhaps, the biggest untold story at Ford, we've successfully recruited a roster of an incredible talent from some of the world's best technology companies who are here to ship product and are supercharging our ability to design that software-defined vehicle and, of course, the software and services that go into those vehicles for the future.
At the same token and at the same time, we have still so much work ahead.
Clearly, we need to continue to improve our competitiveness, not just on quality, but on cost and supply chain management.
And our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we'd like it to be.
I can't overstate the sense of urgency we have to address these critical operating areas.
I look forward to updating you on future calls.
Now, I'd like to share an important strategic shift in our autonomous vehicle strategy.
Five years ago, we committed to invest $1 billion in Argo AI to develop autonomous Level 4 technology.
In 2020, we completed the transaction that resulted in Ford and VW both owning the majority of Argo at equal levels.
We still believe in Level 4 autonomy that it will have a big impact on our business of moving people.
We've learned, though, in our partnership with Argo, and after our own internal investments, that we will have a very long road.
It's estimated that more than 100 billion has been invested in the promise of Level 4 autonomy.
And yet, no one has defined a profitable business model at scale.
Based on the change in this outlook and our increasing promise and focus on Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomy, we've decided to wind down the Argo business and impair the investment.
We're working closely with Argo and VW on all the details.
But here's what I want to focus on.
Advancing Level 2 hardware and software beyond what BlueCruise can do today and ultimately enabling our customers to travel in very large ODDs, or operating domains, with their eyes off the road will give them back the single most valuable commodity in our modern lives: time.
This has become mission-critical for us at Ford.
Ford has deployed BlueCruise on many vehicles across hundreds of thousands of Blue zone miles.
We have strong technology partners working alongside us.
And now, we're going to bring in several hundred people from Argo, a brilliant collection of minds, who've done a great job, who have done wonderful work in the L4 space.
But their job and mission now is to help us create a differentiated Level 4 BlueCruise system.
Yes, there are huge -- this is a huge addressable market and the potential for highly accretive new revenue streams tied to Level 3.
But at the end of the day, this is about giving millions of people that time and eliminating the monotony of highway miles and stop-and-go traffic.
And as for the future of true L4 autonomy, we don't expect there to be a sudden aha moment like we used to.
Deploying L4 broadly, perhaps, the toughest technical problem of our time, will require significant breakthroughs going forward in many areas: reliable and low-cost sensing, it's not the case today; algorithms that can operate on limited compute resources without constraining the operating time and domain of an electric vehicle; breakthroughs in neural networks that can learn to operate a car more safely than a human, even in very complex urban environments.
The muscles we have built with our new talent in broadly deploying a transformative Blue Cruise L3 system will ultimately be essential to the future of accessible driverless vehicles in everyday life.
What's so exciting for me is that we are on the cusp of a transformational moment for Ford.
We will introduce a lineup of not first but second-cycle EVs that are not only fully software updatable and constantly improving, but they will generate an 8% plus margin; an amazing array of software-enabled services, not just BlueCruise L3, but many others, video services for software -- for safety and security; and we're already shipping a broad range of Ford Pro productivity tools and 100% uptime services for our commercial customers.
That is a transformation for us.
Let me now switch to the quarter.
With Ford Model e, we're on track to reach our annual production rate of 600,000 EVs by the end of next year and 2 million by 2026.
I'll say that carefully.
There is no change to our target.
We're adding shifts to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightings as we speak, and we're scaling production of E-Transit.
In Europe, our all-new EV manufacturing center in Cologne will finish complete -- will be complete in turning out vehicles midway through next year.
Our Ford Otosan JV in Turkey is not only scaling the two-tonne E-Transit, but they're also going to be launching a brand-new product, a one-tonne E-Transit custom electric, while breaking ground on a new battery plant that will supply those for those transits.
And in September, we're starting production -- we've already started construction of Blue Oval City in Tennessee, where we will build a new-generation EV truck and batteries.
And at the same time, we've already broken ground as well on the new BlueOval SK battery plants, plural, in Kentucky.
We're also further strengthening Model e's EV supply chain.
Our team is making great progress in securing raw materials, importantly the processing of those raw materials and the battery capacity that we need.
We expect the U.S.
Inflation Reduction Act to have a wide range of positive impacts for both our customers and for Ford.
What's not yet clear is the degree to which the IRA will drive customer demand versus offsetting our EV investments in growth.
So, let me touch on some of the potential benefits of the IRA.
The first opportunity is our largest, the battery production tax credit of about $45 per kilowatt hour.
From '23 to '26, we estimate a combined available tax credit for Ford and our battery partners could total more than $7 billion with large step-up in annual credits in '27 as our JV battery plants ramp up to full production.
The second benefit is often overlooked.
I haven't actually read any one of the media covering this, but it's super important for Ford.
And that's the commercial EV credit.
You know that Ford is the No.
1 commercial vehicle brand in the U.S., and our commercial customers can now claim next year $7,500 per EV vehicle they buy with no restrictions on battery sourcing or manufacturing.
Our preliminary estimate is that between 55% and 65% of all of our commercial vehicle customers will qualify.
The third opportunity is retail.
Ford EVs and our PHEVs remain eligible for the $7,500 tax credit until guidance is issued at the end of this year.
Next year, we believe we'll meet the $3,750 critical materials credit requirement on certain Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models.
In '24, the rules will further restrict this critical materials credit.
So, we believe it's playing -- a fairly level playing field right now for all the OEMs as our supply chains of critical material extraction and course processing in the U.S.
and FTA develops.
The fourth benefit centers on the funding growth in our investments, such as geothermal energy credit critical for Blue Oval City, the Department of Energy loans, grants to convert our domestic facilities to produce electric vehicles, battery plants and other EV components.
We're exploring all these capabilities and possibilities as you can imagine.
Now, as you know, we shared the new electric customer standards with all of our North America dealers last month in Vegas.
That means a single, simple e-commerce platform, ultra-low vehicle-finished inventory, nonnegotiated pricing and fast charges at all of our dealerships.
Now, early response from the dealers have been very favorable.
Many are poised to invest to meet these new standards for electric vehicle customers, while other dealers will opt to specialize Ford Blue Oval or Ford Pro.
And there's real rewards for going first.
Turning to Ford Blue.
We view this business, Ford Blue, as growth.
Last month, we unveiled the seventh-generation Mustang.
We showed the all-new amazing Super Duty in Churchill Downs in Kentucky.
And there -- these are all very well-executed products with incredible technology and upgraded electrical architectures with advanced powertrains.
And they really set them apart from the competition.
What you can't see is what we see.
Our design studio is filled with new products and derivatives that will expand our hit franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Mustang and the new Maverick and the Explorer and the Ranger, all segments that we're a leader among the leaders.
And I can't wait to show you these new derivatives based on ICE and hybrid powertrains.
Finally, let's talk about Pro.
In the U.S., customers trust us more than -- with more than 40% of the market for full-sized commercial trucks and vans.
In Europe, we're also the No.
1 commercial vehicle brand.
That's for seven years now, soon to be eight.
Businesses of all sizes and types are using Ford Pro's vehicles, as well as the suite of our services to lower their cost and improve their productivity.
Now, that includes multi-mix fleets, and fleets that are a mix of ICE and EVs.
Ford Pro has a real opportunity to grow service and parts sales by offering better experiences like mobile service.
We expect to have more than 1,200 mobile service units in operation globally by the end of this year.
And they're driving significant dealer parts and service revenue.
Actually, more than $10,000 per global -- per unit, service unit, per month.
But the real game changer for us in the Pro business in parts and service growth is software, software centered on productivity, telematics, security, and predictive failure of all components.
In the third quarter, we saw our paid telematics for Pro grow by over 40% sequentially for the third straight quarter.
Our suite of Ford Pro software solutions keeps getting stronger and stronger, as we launch new offerings like Ford Pro fleet and the VIIZR field service management software.
But before I hand it over to John, let me end with this.
We have many challenges as a company, and we're tackling them head-on.
That's clear from our third quarter results.
At the same time, I'm so excited about the future we're creating with Ford+.
We're building completely new businesses with the best of Ford talent and incredible new talent across not just Model e, but Ford Blue and Ford Pro.
We're strengthening our product portfolio across the board, building on what we think is the strongest portfolio we've ever had.
And we're tracking the scale to a global run rate of 2 million EVs a year by 2026, and we're investing in growth.
Taken together, this work statement is nothing short of refounding one of the world's most iconic companies to compete and win in a brand-new era.
There's no holding back.
There's no looking back.
There's no slowing down.
In fact, we're accelerating our transformation.
John?
"
2295,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thank you, John.
The decision we made to reallocate our capital is a strategic one.
It's some combination of the margins we're starting to see on our software, like Ford Pro, that's really the first large shippable software.
The usage patterns we're seeing in BlueCruise, how much people use it, and how passionate they are, and that's before ICE off; the confidence we now have in delivering L2 -- Level 3; the access to public markets for Level 4 funding; the opaqueness, as John said, of the view to return capital, the invested capital in Level 4 and Level 5.
And it's some combination of that and a few other factors.
But the biggest factor is our growing confidence in our talent, both the Argo talent and the team at Ford that Doug is building.
And I'm sure in the investment conference, that will be a big focus of his comments.
It's that combination, more than are we behind or we ahead that informed us of this decision.
And I think it's one of the bigger moments for us as a leadership team.
And we are so excited about the software we can ship to our vehicles.
We see it in BlueCruise now.
We see in Ford Pro.
And we see other software that we're in the midst of.
And the other key enabler is our growing confidence in landing a fully software-updatable vehicle as we launch our second cycle of EVs.
John, maybe it's best for you to talk about the reallocation of capital.
"
2296,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Thank you, Mark.
I think, Doug, is best suited to answer this.
All I would say is that we're timing the arrival in line with our second cycle of EVs and a fully updatable -- software-updatable vehicle.
So, kind of think of that '23 to '25 time frame is Ford completely refreshing its EV lineup globally, introducing fully updatable electrical architectures and in-house software development for controlling the vehicle, leveraging all of our experience of now we've done 5 million OTAs, and on enhanced Level 2+ and Level 3 system.
Over to you, Doug.

2297,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"And we're really excited about the Argo team helping us with that internal effort.
"
2298,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"It only accelerates what we're going to do for sure.
And what's exciting for us is being a 40% player in the U.S.
and the top brand in Europe of commercial vehicles.
In the U.S., I mean, we never had this before.
And to give you a sense of the EV tax credit for commercial, how evocative that is for Ford, the people who buy a police vehicle, so people who buy ambulances for communities, the emergency responders, they never had tax credits.
They are going to have -- this is not just a $7,500 tax credit for consumers.
This is for businesses, including local municipalities.
So, I think this will have a dramatic impact on the adoption of EV, which we're already 90% market share in the e-van business.
We think we'll really accelerate the demand for these commercial EVs.
And that's only going to accelerate our speed to market and our scaling of those vehicles.
We can't wait to show you the vehicles themselves because they're second-generation commercial EVs.
So, you know, this is going to accelerate.
What's not clear yet, I said, is will the consumer demand side of this legislation be the largest benefit to our customers in the company? Or will it be more like the industrialization of vehicles? That's something to play out in the marketplace.
And it's hard to handicap that, honestly.
"
2299,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
Well, I wish we could go into the commercial negotiation with our battery partners, but I'm not going to go into it now.
But you can imagine there's lots of interesting discussions going on right now between because we're obviously in the middle -- I mean, some -- we've already inked a deal on our DAs.
Others are still in the mix.
So, I wish I could cover that with you right now, but I don't think that would be fair to our battery partners to go public with -- with how that's going to benefit both of us.
But you can imagine.
I mean, I just think of it, generally speaking, as proportional to our investments.
On the commercial EV, I have to say, the demand for the move to electric on our commercial customers is, in many ways, more robust than the retail side, even though we're completely sold out in both, for the three products.
The turn rates are just enormous, the order rates.
But the profitability is different between a commercial EV and a retail EV.
And we're going to be breaking out our EV business and profitability soon.
So, this is going to be quite interesting for all of you and for us as we do that.
So -- but I will tell you, this is a big help.
This will really help the profitability of our commercial vehicle that are EV.
And I think it will really stimulate the demand.
The tricky part for us is, operationally, what do we do between now and the end of the year.
That's the tricky part for us operationally, is we have a lot of customers who are going to wait until next year to order, you know, a Lightning Pro or an E-Transit.
But I think, for sure, this is just going to upset that equilibrium.
We have to -- by the way, we have to -- we have this discussion inside the Company every day.
How many Lighting Pros do we want to make? And how many Lightning retail F-150 EVs do we want to make? So, it's already quite spirited discussion.
But I think this will help our profitability quite a bit even next year, which you will see.
And we're really excited about this change.
I mean, having almost 65% of our customers qualify, including local municipalities, is a game changer for our demand.
Yeah.
John, anything you want to divulge about the negotiations?
"
2300,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"OK.
"
2301,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"That is a very good question.
So, you know, obviously, we have this unique profile as a commercial company in EV.
And we now have, I mean, literally all the commercial pickup truck business that's EV.
And we're 90%-plus on the van side.
So, it's a very important question for us.
And we also think for affordability, back to Rod's point, LFP is a very important technology, and all the IP is in China.
So, this is a really dynamic situation.
I think what you'll see is that the tariff rules of the importing LFP batteries into the U.S.
is still very favorable, so.
And we have a really great contract with a particular LFP supplier to incorporate those batteries next year.
So, I think, we're in really good shape.
The real billion-dollar question is, when do you localize production of LFP in North America? And is that in the U.S.
and Mexico? And, you know, where do you build the cells versus pack? And, you know, whose name is on the front of the building and all that? And, you know, we're not going to go into that.
But I will tell you that just given the reality of the tariff structure, you know, we can import LFP from China economically now.

2304,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Well, I think it's best, John, for us to hear from Doug.
"
2305,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"But before we do that, I want to emphasize that a winning L4 business is as much about the go-to-market investment of a consumer-facing service.
And all the depots, all the HD mapping of all the ODs across this enormous geography, all the enormous fleet, and because it's still weather-constrained, you have to have a driven fleet to complement it.
So, aside from the -- handicapping the technology, the enormous investment that will have to be made in the nontechnology pieces is a big factor in our thinking.
And, Doug, maybe you could talk about how we're -- because we're still very excited about Level 4, how you see it as a technologist on the technology portion?

Next question is from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.
Please go ahead.
"
2307,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Absolutely.
As I mentioned, Colin, we looked at many variables, and one of them is access to public markets.
We were very clear that the Argo journey would include access to public markets over the last year.
And, you know, we feel like that's a lot more challenged.
So, yes, we looked at possible partnerships and funding.
But it was one of maybe 10 factors that we looked at in making this decision.
John, maybe -- why don't you share your -- our discussion as a leadership team on the time frame?
"
2308,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Yes, pricing.
Net pricing continues to remain strong.
Exactly, pricing continues to remain strong.
"
2309,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Yeah.
So, one of the things that we're doing is, as we're taking settlements with the supply base, we're looking to do that more in a lump-sum fashion, so that it's not baked into the piece price.
And we'll share more about what that means on a go-forward basis as we talk about '23 in Q4.
So, what we've provided for the year is $9 billion, up from $7 billion last quarter when we reported it.
The amount of $1 billion in the third quarter was part of the third quarter, but it was also a settlement for the first half as well.
And it largely reflects a lot of ways, a confluence of factors that led to that.
One of the things we are having better clarity around is schedule and stability.
And combining that with labor shortages and our high complexity, that had a larger impact on the supply base's ability to deliver cost efficiencies this year and much higher than we expected, and quite frankly, higher than we were initially willing to accept.
And so, we spent a lot of time with our supplier partners.
And we came to the conclusion.
And that included conversations all the way up with June with supplier CEOs.
And our conclusion coming out of that was that it became evident that we needed to increase the settlement amount, support our supplier partners, and we made the call in the third quarter.
And then, we told all of you as soon as we made that call, so that we got out in front of it and knew what we knew.
"
2310,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Yeah.
So, we are seeing the commodity spot prices come off a bit.
But quite honestly, it's not meaningful enough at this point to make a significant impact.
I think, you know, we're all trying to work through the macroeconomic environment how far are things going to slow down, how quickly will that drive easing of commodity prices, will that also drive, you know, ease in the whole logistics chain.
We know that logistic prices are up significantly.
Ocean freight is up significantly.
And so, you know, right now, we're trying to make that call on 2023, with a quarter left to go, is a really difficult thing to do.
So, we're going to hold off on doing any of that today.
And we'll be able to talk about more of that with our Q4 earnings at the beginning of next year.
"
2311,F,2022,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"Thank you, Rod.
The early signs are coming in.
It's interesting.
It's lumpy.
The commercial vehicle and EV demand is through the roof.
We've seen literally no -- no change, if not an increase.
And that includes commercial vehicles in Europe, which is interesting.
Our order bank continues to grow.
It's multi, multi month.
We continue to have to close out order windows for our commercial vehicles because of the demand.
Same for EVs, as we've taken prices up.
On the retail side, in the U.S., what I see that's different from last quarter is slight uptick on 84-month customer financing.
And, Marion, if you want to go into that, that's fine.
We're seeing, obviously, an easing of used cars, which makes trade-ins, and those transactions that include trade-ins a little more challenging for customers for higher payments.
We're seeing -- the one that I watch the most is our turn rates for F-150.
It's our highest-volume vehicle.
And we're starting to see some differences in turn rates between XLT and Lariat.
It's small right now, but it's different.
In the past, Lariat's turned faster than XLT, and that's reversed compared to the quarter.
It's really subtle right now.
So, what I'd expect on pricing -- and you see some of our competitors come in with higher spending now on incentives.
So, we've already accounted for some of that, as John has said, in the past.
What I would be looking for and what I think is important to watch for is the mix changes.
The mixes of series and specifications within a profitable nameplate, like Super Duty or F-150, or mix shifts, obviously, between models.
Rod, our lineup is so fresh right now.
It's very opaque for us.
So, the only mix shift we're seeing is within spec.
Marion, do you want to mention anything about payments?
"
2312,F,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
Just a follow-up on the Argo, just to be clear, I mean, did you look for acquirers for the business? I mean, obviously, rather than taking a big impairment.
And, you know, maybe a follow-up a little bit.
What is your kind of timeline for Level 4 that you're looking at? I mean, do you think this is 20 years out at this point? I mean, I guess you had a comment with some sort of assessment before you made the decision.
"
2313,F,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,1,"Got it.
And I actually have a quick follow-up.
In terms of the guidance change, you lowered guidance at the midpoint by 500 million.
But you did indicate raw materials look like about a 2 billion worse headwind.
You lowered forward credit, volume guidance came down.
So, any color on the offset to the headwinds that you outlined in the release?
"
2314,F,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,2,"OK.
And the offset to that 2 billion in results, is that pricing and possible vehicle mix? Sorry.
"
2315,F,2022,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,3,"OK.
All right.

2317,F,2022,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, guys.
Thanks for all the detail.
A lot of questions, I'll try to keep it to one here.
You know, on the pivot from AV to ADAS or semiautonomous, Jim, there's a lot of moving pieces here.
But there are some out there that believe they have a solution to this that's close to working.
And I think some of us thought that Argo might be not that far behind.
So, I'm curious what changed.
And if you think those folks may be misguided in their assumption that they actually have a solution.
And sort of the corollary to that is, are you going to take this capital? And it sounds like you are going to, and accelerate your EV and your connectivity efforts that will generate profits much more quickly in the near term.
And how much profit opportunity are there -- or is there around these connected vehicles that you're seeing with Pro that might spill over into the consumer side?
"
2318,F,2022,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"If I could just maybe just follow up on that.
I mean there's got to be a high level of confidence that you're not going to be left behind as autonomy may develop over time.
So, I mean, a skeptic would say, you know, you're throwing in the towel, and you can't keep up.
An optimist would say, you know, you actually have confidence, and you'll be able to keep up and maybe surpass the competition over time.
I mean, how would you couch it, you know, in that range?

Maybe, Jim, just picking up there on the IRA side, you mentioned the $7 billion between Ford and the partners.
I believe that is sort of that full $45.
Can we just drill down a little bit? Because it would seem to me like you should at least be able to get the 10 for the pack starting next year.
And then, where are you in sort of negotiating, you know, maybe how much of that 35 you can get from some of your partners? And then, just on the commercial side, like, should we really think -- how should we think about, I guess, the mix of EVs next year between commercial and retail? Because it seems like it's, to your point, pretty skewed in one direction.
"
2323,F,2022,3,joe-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"Maybe just, you know, Jim, you've clearly shown since you've -- since you've been CEO that you've been willing to adapt and change to new information and circumstances, like the Argo announcements today, I think.
And the other example would be, I guess, the LFP strategy you talked about earlier this summer.
But I guess that has even maybe potentially changed a little bit again since, I guess, geopolitically, the U.S.
relationship with China might have turned south.
So, any update on that? And is there a backup plan? Is there any risk to any of those timelines?

"
2326,F,2022,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Jim.
So, when I look at the quarter and our performance year to date, I actually see some real positive.
First, our strategic actions to segment and stand out three distinct businesses: Ford Model e, Ford Blue, and Ford Pro, while not complete yet, is truly transformational and is already changing how we manage the business.
So, it's about more than just accelerating profitable growth, it's also about how we are going to do that by orienting everything around our different types of customers.
The separation of these businesses is revealing to the entire organization how deeply rooted complexity is in our legacy business and how this disadvantages us in quality, innovation, customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, cost and efficiency.
And we see it everywhere, from design, to engineering, to manufacturing, and how we interact with each other and our suppliers.
And so, to me, this is really exciting.
We understand the magnitude of opportunity and leverage that this will provide across the entire business.
Now, we just need to deliver.
Second, our product portfolio has never been stronger.
Starting with our top-selling first-generation EVs like Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit to our new models of category-leading vehicles like Mustang and Super Duty, as well as popular derivatives like Raptor and Tremor.
These are all inspiring products that our customers love.
And finally, our capital allocation choices are really paying off.
Our sustainable free cash flow generation from our automotive business is improving significantly, even as we accelerate investments in electrification and connectivity.
And this improvement reflects the tough choices that we have made to focus on our strengths, hone our footprint and our product portfolio, especially outside of North America.
So, with that as a backdrop, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter.
We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, above the $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion guidance range we provided last month.
In automotive, wholesales were up 7% year over year.
However, EBIT was weighed down by the rich mix of 40,000 vehicles on wheels we had in inventory at the end of the quarter and about $1 billion in lump sum supplier settlements.
The settlements offset costs incurred by our suppliers, partially due to inflationary impacts on labor, freight and commodities, as well as higher costs because of our inconsistent production schedule, which has been disruptive for our partners.
So, providing greater certainty and schedule stability to our supply base is just one example of the many opportunities we have in front of us as we transform our global supply chain.
So, we're very grateful for our suppliers' ongoing support and the collaborative approach they are taking to address production shortfalls, while also focusing on improving the quality of the parts they ship to us.
In the quarter, we delivered 3.6 billion in free cash flow, with strong cash generation by our automotive business, despite the adverse effects of the 40,000 vehicles on wheels.
We expect the negative working capital impact of those units to reverse in the fourth quarter when the vehicles are completed and shipped to dealers.
Our balance sheet continues to be very healthy.
And we ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of 32 billion and 49 billion, respectively.
And these numbers include our remaining stake in Rivian, which was valued at less than $1 billion at the end of the quarter.
Now, I'll touch on the performance of our business units.
North America delivered 1.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 5%.
Both of those measures were driven down year over year by higher commodity costs, inflationary pressures, and a diverse mix, reflecting the buildup of vehicles on wheels and inventory.
Our brand strength and order banks remain very strong, and we expect the North American margin to return to double digits in the fourth quarter.
South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering strong margins in its fifth consecutive profitable quarter.
In Europe, we posted a profit of $200 million.
And supply chain constraints began to ease, resulting in sequential wholesale growth of 23%.
Our commercial vehicle business continues to fortify its leadership position ending the quarter with a 15.2% share year to date.
And in China, we posted a loss of 200 million, driven by the investments we are making in electric vehicles.
Lincoln continues to be a bright spot for the region with share improving again sequentially.
Our International Markets Group continues to be solidly profitable.
EBIT margins were over 8%, driven by the launch of our exciting all-new Ranger.
And then, finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of 600 million that reflected a more normalized run rate for this business.
The anticipated sequential profit decline was driven by the nonoperating release of credit loss reserves and higher borrowing costs.
Let me now walk through our impairment of Argo.
As Jim highlighted, it's become clear that the technology required to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale is going to take much longer than we previously expected.
L2+ and L3 driver-assistance technologies have a larger addressable customer base, which will allow it to scale more quickly and profitably.
And that's going to provide accretive annuity-like revenue streams.
During the third quarter, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from the L4 technology being developed by Argo to internally develop L2+, L3 technology.
And as a result, in the third quarter, we recorded a 2.7 billion noncash pre-tax impairment as a special item.
Now, let me share with you our current outlook.
For the year, we expect to earn about 11.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up about 15% from 2021 with about a 10% increase in wholesales.
We're now projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion to $10 billion.
Our year-over-year basis for our '22 adjusted EBIT target assumes significantly higher earnings in North America; aggregate profitability in the rest of the world; Ford Credit EBT at about $2.7 billion, with strong, though lower, auction values in the fourth quarter as the supply of new vehicles improves and higher borrowing costs; continued strong pent-up demand in orders for Ford's newest products; continued strength in pricing; higher commodity and broad-based inflationary costs of about 9 billion; no further deterioration in supply chain; and continuation of a strong dollar.
So, finally, before getting to your questions, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting.
Last quarter, we mentioned our plan to host a teach-in event early next year to help you prepare for this change to a radically new strategic organization ahead of our first quarter 2023 reporting.
So, we've now fixed the date for March.
At the teach-in, we will share both 2021 and 2022 revised results to reflect our new segmentation, which we will start using for reporting purposes in Q1 of 2023.
But because this is far more than an accounting exercise, we'll also reiterate and illustrate the business rationale for the change along with the reporting mechanics and implications for our earnings disclosures and SEC filings.
And we'll furnish you with a full toolkit to help you transition your models.
So, that wraps up our prepared remarks.
We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds.
And thank you.

[Operator instructions] Our first question today is from John Murphy with Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
"
2327,F,2022,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
So, first off, we're not capital constrained.
We're investing our $50 billion.
We're investing on top of that in connectivity and software.
So, we ended the quarter with $32 billion of cash and $49 billion of liquidity.
So, it's taking that investment and putting it toward a business where we think we will have a sizable return in the near term relative to one that's going to have a long arc.
And that's the business decision behind it.
So, I think we need to be very clear about that.
We're going to invest in L2 and L3, and some of the savings that we have will go into that.
"
2328,F,2022,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yeah.
So, Colin, when we looked at this, as Jim said, not only does it require the technology breakthroughs and the capital invested in the technology, but then in all the services and fleets, scaling across the country that would be required to get to a profitable business.
We saw that, you know, five years-plus the horizon being that far out before you could actually get to something that started to generate a meaningful business.
And we see a much greater opportunity to impact more customers immediately with the L2, L3 technology, and impact our business in a positive way in the more near-term time frame.
So, that was part of the business discussion that we had with the team.
"
2329,F,2022,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes.
I think it's really two things.
It's, you know, the mix that we can see, vehicle line mix coming out of the supply base and then sterling.
The exposure we have, as you know, we're the largest commercial vehicle player in Europe from a brand standpoint.
And we have a very strong presence in the UK.
And so, that currency change did hit us quite hard after the quarter closed.
And so, when we look at that, one of the things that we've done, Colin, that I've done, is I spent a lot of time -- the team has -- the last couple of weeks, doing deep dive on-site reviews of the supply base.
In fact, we're approaching a deep review of almost 300 of those suppliers.
And what we're finding is that there's a number of nonchip suppliers that are struggling to ramp production as the chip crisis eases.
And it's not easing tremendously, it's easing slightly.
We're starting to see that.
But then we're seeing issues in nonchip suppliers.
It has to do with the tight labor market, but it also has to do refining with many of the suppliers during the COVID time frame had not invested in maintenance or in their facilities and tooling.
And so, they're not able to ramp as we expected.
And that's hit us in the fourth quarter on mix versus what we had expected.
And so, it's really the mix in the currency that's getting to us and brought us down to the low end of our range.

Good afternoon.
Thank you very much for taking the questions.
So, maybe you could share more on the timing to bring L3 products to market? And is that something you think Ford will be developing in-house, perhaps, with some benefit from Argo capabilities? I was just thinking something you, perhaps, leverage from some of the suppliers in some of their potential input or maybe some combination?
"
2333,F,2022,3,mark-delaney,goldman-sachs,True,1,"That's quite helpful.
Thank you.
And one more on EVs, if I could, please.
You mentioned the myriad of ways that the IRA could potentially benefit Ford.
And you reiterated the capacity ramp targets through 2026, I believe.
But do you think over the longer term and, perhaps, out over the next 10 years or so, does the IRA change the gross amount of investment you want to make into EVs and how quickly Ford may shift toward EVs, especially in the latter part of this decade? Thanks.

The next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.

2336,F,2022,3,doug-field,chief-advanced-product-development-and-technology-officer,False,0,"Sure, Jim.
As you mentioned, this is going to be a really tough problem to solve.
It's the toughest problem of our generation.
And I don't think about it as capital constraints nearly as much as talent constraints.
In the kind of projects that we are diving into at Ford and the kind of work that we're doing, the constraint really becomes how many of the world's best people can you get working on a problem.
And that's really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we're doing here at Argo is we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission.
We have ideas of how it can work and how customers can interact with it that are really exciting, particularly when you add them to our next-generation EVs.
So, this is the way we want to use that talent.
And we think it's the most meaningful way for them to impact the world.
"
2337,F,2022,3,doug-field,chief-advanced-product-development-and-technology-officer,False,1,"Thanks, Jim.
We are not going to ignore the capabilities of suppliers that can provide value in our L3 solution.
They are great manufacturers of components of systems, such as imaging sensors and radar.
And we'll take advantage of that.
But we will have a core team that can integrate a system, understand its performance at the system level, and we will own the software.
It is really important that we also own the connection to these vehicles.
L3 is a connected technology.
So, the ability to have a pipeline that collects data and makes the system better and better, we must own that.
Finally, the customer experience, how the customer moves in and out of autonomous operation, that's a problem that actually doesn't exist in L4 and is a huge opportunity for us to create a Ford experience that's really unique.
So, those are the areas that we will absolutely develop great capability in-house and focus on in the L3 development.

We're seeing some customers extending terms for vehicle affordability trying to stay at the same payment level.
But with higher transaction prices and higher interest rates, customers are going longer term.
And we've seen vehicle payment, even with that, move out quite a bit this year.
And it's -- that's starting to have a bit of an effect.
And it's in pockets around the country as well.
So, many areas are still very, very strong.
In other areas, you hear about deals not going through because of, you know, changes in payment quality.
"
2341,F,2022,3,marion-harris,"chief-executive-officer,-ford-credit",False,1,"Yeah.
Let me just give you the key takeaways here.
First of all, our balance sheet is significantly smaller than it was a few years ago, right off the top.
Second, we're no longer releasing COVID-related credit loss reserves.
We're back at what we would consider normal reserve levels.
Third, our lease depreciation tailwinds are mostly behind us, and we have lower used car values as we look forward.
And fourth, our borrowing costs are higher, which we haven't been able to fully pass on to customers as rates have risen rapidly.
That's something, though, that, over time, we do expect the balance sheet to grow.
And we would expect some continued borrowing cost headwinds, but those will moderate and ease over time as the portfolio returns.

2343,F,2022,2,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, Jim and John.
So pricing has been a massive tailwind, and it looks like mix is becoming pretty powerful now too.
Can you just talk to us a little bit about the interplay between affordability and volume? Just especially in the environment that we're in right now and with still a lot of inflation on the horizon, do you think demand can return at this level of price? And are you willing to forgo volume to sustain contribution margins?
"
2344,F,2022,2,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"That makes sense.
And then just secondly, can you just provide any color you can on what's happening from a supply chain perspective? Any thoughts on whether this Europe natural gas situation is something that is a major concern for you? And then lastly, any detail on the $3 billion of cost inflation in North America.
It looked like a large number.
Was there anything unusual in that number?

2347,F,2022,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Jim, the Bronco Raptor, so badass.
I don't know if I put an order and now if I'll get it by the end of the decade, but maybe I'll try.
Jim, this is one of the most positive Ford calls I can remember in a long, long time.
Does Ford have too many people?
"
2348,F,2022,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"All right.
Appreciate that, Jim.
Just one follow-up on the dealers.
They're having an amazing time.
Their new gross margins have more than tripled, and they're making dealer grosses that are, in many cases, higher than what you're making on selling the product, right? Like they're making more money selling the product that you -- the margin you're making on actually making the product.
And all they're doing is just watching the things come off a truck, and they're presold.
So I know you guys spent a huge amount of time on pricing at Ford.
Is there anything you can do to help even the score a bit on price? Because when I ask the dealers why isn't Ford raising -- or your peers raising some of the invoice more, even they don't have a reason like we don't know why they're not doing it.
And then they often say things that I don't believe, which is that you can't or you're not moving fast enough or the systems aren't there.
So what are we missing? Thanks.

Hello, everyone.
The Ford team delivered a very solid second quarter in a challenging environment where we saw supply chain disruptions, a lot of new economic headwinds, and uncertainty as a whole.
Importantly, we achieved these results as we advance the Ford+ plan, which is the biggest opportunity to create value at Ford since we scaled the Model T.
And at the core of Ford+ are three fundamental promises to our customers: distinctive and breakthrough products and experiences; and always on relationship with Ford every day, every hour, every minute; and ever-improving post-purchase user experiences powered by software.
Today, I'll give you an update on Ford+ and the early results of our decisions to reorganize the company into three distinct segments: Model e, Ford Blue, and Ford Pro.
Now let me start with the progress we're making to lead the electric vehicle and digital revolution.
What's lost in the industry's arm race of claims regarding capital invested, the number of top hats we all have, the promises of future leadership is one fundamental question: who is and will be the best position to design truly distinctive and appealing products that people actually love? That's the question.
Now we've been overwhelmed with the demand for our first-generation EVs, the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning, and the E-Transit.
These products are in the market now, and we have strong multiyear order banks.
We're selling them as fast as we can make them.
And you can't say that about many of the EVs coming to market now.
We believe that these great new products will enable us to grab an outsized share of the rapidly growing EV market, combined with our healthy and vibrant shares of our ICE and growing hybrid markets.
This month, we expect to produce 14,000 EVs globally.
That's significantly higher than just a few months ago, and we have a clear path to reach a run rate of 60,000 EVs by the end of next year.
And that will lead to a foundation to 2 million by late 2026.
In fact, our anticipated growth rate in EVs through 2026 is more than twice what we expect for the global EV industry in total.
Now securing the raw materials to produce batteries at scale is critical to our plan.
It's estimated that, at best, 50% of all raw materials required to meet the combined announced targets for all EV OEMs is actually available, 50%.
And this is why speed to securing supply is so critical and strategic, so is diversifying our battery chemistries to increase our flexibility, supply, and profit and to support different customer use cases.
Last week, we announced a series of MOUs and agreements to fulfill our ambition -- ambitious needs that I covered, and we are working to complete definitive agreements where necessary.
Our Model e team moved quickly to capture these opportunities.
To summarize, we've added battery chemistries and secure contracts, delivering 60-gigawatt hours of annual battery capacity, which will help us support fully the 600,000 units of that 2023 run rate of capacity.
We now have lithium-ion phosphate, or LFP, battery packs coming for the Mach-E sold in North America next year and for Lightning in early 2024, creating more capacity for these high-demand products.
We secured 70% of the battery capacity needed to support 2 million units by the end of 2026, and we struck a new deal with CATL on strategic cooperation for global battery supplies, as well as deals for direct sourcing of critical battery raw materials in the U.S., Australia, Indonesia, and more locations.
And we have a plan to localize 40-gigawatt hours per year LFP capacity in North America by 2026.
These deals are a strong start as we fortify our EV supply chain that's aligned with our sustainability and human rights principles.
Now let's talk about the progress we're making in building out and always on relationship with customers and that ever-improving user experience enabled by software after the customer buys a vehicle.
Now along with product execution, these are really the relevant sustainable advantages we see to create, in today's hypercompetitive market, a difference where the real competition is not legacy OEMs, but pure-play EV companies, including emerging Chinese players.
For example, more than 55,000 Ford customers have already driven nearly 10 million miles with BlueCruise, our hands-free L2 system.
That's just one year after the capacity was launched, and we started OTA-ing this to our vehicles.
We're using the data we get through BlueCruise to continue to improve the customer experience.
And as it happens, you can imagine a significant ADAS revenue and profit stream being created by giving customers the ability to work, watch a film, or even take a nap during a long trip in their Ford.
While the financial benefits of ADAS are clear, as is our Ford Pro services stack, they're relatively small now, but we're rapidly increasing the number of digital vehicles on the road, as well as attach rates of the enabling services.
And over time, much of the SaaS revenue will be deferred on our balance sheet, providing an annuity-like revenue stream that is highly accretive, something this company and this industry has never seen.
Now before I turn to Ford Blue, let me talk briefly about our connected EV dealer model in the U.S.
Changes in the market have compelled Ford and our dealers to revisit how customers shop, buy and own, and how they will do this going forward.
We're moving fast as the transition to these digital EV platforms allows us to help our dealers provide better customer ownership experience post purchase, and in turn, enables them to expand the revenue and profit pools, expanding and improving their returns.
We're working with our dealers to create a retail model better than what's offered by any traditional OEM and better than the start-ups who are now scrambling to develop sales and service networks to support customers in an attempt to sustain and grow share in UIO.
In the U.S.
alone, if we can help our dealers increase service loyalty by just 20 points, that's $2.4 billion incremental revenue for them every year.
Now since March, we've conducted more than 30 workshops in the U.S.
and Canada, reaching hundreds of our dealers.
I have personally been involved in many of these meetings.
What is clear to me but not yet visible to the market is that our dealers are embracing this change.
They know the competitive threat is real, and they want Ford and their dealership to lead and win.
And we have more to share as this develops.
Now turning to Ford Blue.
The team is motivated by this sharpening focus on our ICE and hybrid products.
We've added new talent and leadership to drive performance and focus in our trucks our great family lineup and our enthusiast vehicles were so proud of.
We've revealed new vehicles like the Bronco Raptor, the Bronco Everglades, the F-150 Raptor R, which my kids think sounds great.
In the third quarter, we'll unveil an all-new seventh-generation Mustang at the North America International Auto Show in Detroit.
It is a stunning car, and I'm so excited to share it with the world.
And also this fall, we'll be introducing an all-new Super Duty pickup, the workhorse at Ford, and it sets a standard in our industry.
There's much more to come.
Our design center is filled with new products and derivatives that will further strengthen our hit vehicles in the ICE and hybrid franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Maverick, the brand-new global Ranger that's launching in Thailand, and our new Everest.
In short, our hottest and freshest lineup in recent history is getting even better.
Now in commercial vehicle market, Ford Pro, our industry-leading global business, is leading the change into an electric software-driven world.
Other OEMs are talking about large numbers of future electric orders.
We're actually taking orders for manufacturing and selling commercial vehicles now.
Through the second quarter, we've sold more than 3,000 E-Transit in the U.S.
That's a market share of 95% in the full-sized electric van market, 95%.
In fact, our next two competitors combined sold just 159 vehicles.
Beyond the vehicles, we're also rolling out our Ford Pro charging commercial solutions and the very exciting and fast-growing e-telematics software solutions.
And boy, are they paying off.
And in Europe, where we continue to be the leading commercial vehicle brand, we already received 8,000 orders for our two-tonne E-Transit, and our new one-tonne E-Transit Custom goes on sale next year.
Now our Ford Pro software business is growing quickly.
Paid telematics subscriptions globally have grown over 40% sequentially for the last two quarters.
Turning to quality.
We made solid progress in initial quality, as you've seen in the recent J.D.
Power's IQS study, and our launches have improved.
However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions.
Yes, this affects our cost, but more importantly, it falls short on our most fundamental commitment to our customers.
Quality is our No.
1 priority.
In fact, we recently brought on Josh Halliburton from J.D.
Power to head quality.
Now the team is focused on three critical areas: prevention, detection, and remediation.
We've instituted more robust engineering sign-off processes for the vehicles that are in the product development factory as we speak.
We're driving much more frequent alignment with our supply base on quality.
And when identified issues, we take actions quickly to resolve them, to protect our customer's experience, including by making much more frequent use of over-the-air updates.
And boy, has that worked for us.
We have more work to do in this space, and we will keep you updated.
Overall, we're pleased with the progress this year, but we are not nearly satisfied.
We remain clear-eyed and determined to move with speed and determination on a Ford+ transformation.
The underlying strength of our business supports our 2022 adjusted EBIT guidance range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, unchanged from April.
Before I turn it over to John, I want to end with this.
There's context that's critical to how we think about implementing our Ford+ plan.
Traditionally, the auto industry has cut costs, often indiscriminately.
As an effect, of course, from lower auto demands through economic softness and shift for customer preferences.
What we're undertaking forward is totally different than that.
We're reshaping virtually every aspect of the way we've done business for a century.
And we're doing that for a new industry based on new technology, new skills, and a new promise for customer value.
And yet, cost reduction will happen in our ICE business because that's primarily what is made up of Ford today.
But we're modernizing to take out unnecessary costs, redesigning work, and strategically investing across all of our auto businesses, ICE and hybrid, then EVs and then Ford Pro, while at the same time, transforming every function that supports them.
Sweeping strategic change generates interest and speculation in the media, which we understand.
However, we're going to comment on Ford+ actions we're taking and how they're going to strengthen our company on our own schedule.
John?
"
2354,F,2022,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thank you, John.
We've always been really good on the truck side for those derivatives, but now our chances to expand that capability across all of our lineup.
Ranger is a good example.
We're launching it in Thailand.
We just launched Raptor, Tremor.
There's a lot we can do.
Of course, Mustang is coming out.
Maverick is our most affordable vehicle.
You can only imagine the kind of things that we're cooking up in our design studio with Maverick.
And then, of course, on what we really do well, Broncos, you can imagine high-end versions, all sorts of things.
Everglades came out, it's very popular.
And we do agree our E side, we don't have to change the body to refresh Mach-E, for example.
We are actually completely redoing in a good way our HMI and OTA-ing that to all of our EVs.
But you can imagine with Mustang Mach-E all the cool things we could do.
So -- and it is a sustainable advantage, and we're good at it.
The tension point for us, though, is complexity.
Ford is way too complex.
So as we do this, we have to bring our complexity down to get our bill of materials kind of in line with competition.
It's great that we have all this pricing power forward.
We do have a fresh lineup.
We have lots of cool ideas.
But we're not satisfied with that because we cannot just continue to build this complexity in our business.
So as we add those derivatives, we're going to have to -- we are planning much less complexity in our Blue business.
And that is a theme that will run through Blue for years to come.
"
2355,F,2022,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"I think the way we look at -- yeah.
Good question.
The way we look at this, John, is the days are kind of over where you have to change the upper body to build a supercar or to build an off-road car like kind of days are over, like, we don't have to do that anymore with these digital products, with EV propulsion, with the motors, the software.
We can really take our vehicles and make very different kind of vehicles off of the same body engineering.
And that is a complete game changer for us in terms of capital intensity, i.e., lower.
And I'm really glad you brought that up because I try to emphasize this.
Like we have to be really careful in our industry, and I'm constantly -- we are constantly talking about this as a leadership team.
We cannot have the complexity of top hats that we do on our ICE business.
We have an opportunity as we go digital with these EVs to simplify our body engineering and put the engineer where customers really care.
And it's not a different vendor.
It's software.
It's a digital display technology.
It's a self-driving system and the AV tech.
And of course, it's going to be, some cases, more powerful motors.
"
2356,F,2022,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"As I said in my comments, Adam, we absolutely have too many people in certain places, no doubt about it.
And we have skills that don't work anymore.
We -- and we have jobs that need to change.
And we have lots of new work statements that we've never had before.
We are literally virtually -- we are reshaping our company, like every part of our company.
And on our ICE business, we want to simplify it.
We want to make sure the skills we have and the work statements we have are as lean as possible.
We know our costs are not competitive at Ford.
But we are -- that's what I mean by we are not satisfied.
But I just want to emphasize that in the past, at least in my career for 40 years, we kind of often and discriminately just taking the costs out.
That's not what's happening at Ford now.
This is a different kind of change where we're reshaping the company, reshaping skills, investing in new technologies and simplifying investments in others, i.e., spending less.
So -- and we have -- it's kind of the old adage.
Yes, I think every company probably has too many people.
I just -- we have to go do the workflows and decide how this works now going forward.
"
2357,F,2022,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Sure.
So bottom line is we've taken a lot of pricing.
You could see it in our numbers.
And actually, we all watch this very carefully at Ford.
What is the dealers retained margin versus MSRP? And I have to tell you that ours is one of the best in the industry, i.e., our pricing and the retained margin at MSRP are as close at Ford versus any other brands.
There are others that are in different places.
I think your question is actually bigger than that, which is we have ups and downs in our industry.
And how is this going to -- how is our retailers going to shape as we change this company? And so -- and again, on the electric vehicles, dynamic pricing is very important for us because we went to an ordering system.
And with an ordering system, you have the certainty of orders, but you have to also be responsive on price.
I'm not going to get into the details, but we think we have a way out of that tension point or conundrum.
On overall, how I see dealer margins, as we talk to our dealers and roll up our sleeves, is we need -- because I said our competitors are pure-play EVs and the Chinese that are absolutely coming.
And that means we have to get this $2,000 out of our distribution cost to be competitive with them.
And we think a third it is going to a low inventory model, not -- I'm not saying like 30-day supply or 50.
I don't mean that kind of -- like the customer orders a vehicle, and then we ship the vehicle to the customer.
That's what I mean by a low inventory model.
We have to go to that.
We think that's about -- worth maybe $600, $700 in our system.
Another one is all the selling, SG&A, and advertising costs.
We have three tiers of marketing.
We think that's another $600 a vehicle.
We're going to simplify that.
And we're going to just shift where the e-commerce platform that we don't have today -- all of our e-customers have a very predictable experience, whether they're in a dealership or in their bunny slippers, and they'll have a very simple, transparent, very easy purchase process.
And we're going to invest.
Our marketing model is going to be post purchase.
That will be our differentiator, and that's where we'll invest.
And I think that's a different play than the pure EV companies.
So I see dealer margins still being very competitive, but they are going to shift.
The makeup of those margins going to change.
Does that make sense, Adam?
"
2358,F,2022,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"And on the supply chain, I'd to characterize it, I mean, chips are still an issue.
Transparency is still an issue in the second quarter specifically.
You know we had quite an issue in China with the Shanghai shutdown.
And that affects -- that could have affected our North America manufacturing system.
The team did a great job.
We had a daily call.
We worked every issue.
We built a digital model of all our supply chain down to supply chain in, and it was really helpful.
And we got through it.
Like Roseanne Roseannadanna said, ""If it's not one thing, it's another."" It just feels like what's next.
As far as we're planning everything we know could happen.
The next possibility of the energy crisis in Europe, we played this out already.
We've done our homework.
We have about 550 active suppliers in what I would call the high-risk countries like Czech, Germany, Hungary, Austria, and Slovakia.
We think that the risk is between now and mid-'23 when they can manage through the energy issues.
We have about 130 suppliers for our North America vehicle production in that 550 list, and we now have a 30-day buffer stock.
So we are doing everything we can with the things we know.
On the supply chain outside of -- we have labor shortages and all sorts of things.
The suppliers have been working nonstop during COVID, so machine maintenance and a lot of other things.
We see the output of the stress in the supply chain.
And obviously, their costs have gone up too.
And we're working through all of that with our suppliers.
So I think we're well prepared for the things we can predict, but it's always a new day.
"
2359,F,2022,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Well, thank you, Emmanuel.
I will say there's not going to be a lot of guesswork at Ford because we will financially report our businesses independently of each other.
So it will be all out there for everyone to see.
I don't know about others.
But at Ford, it will be extremely transparent.
I'm not going to get into specifics because I think this is such a material topic.
We need to spend time on it.
We can't rush to this.
I will tell you that in the quarter, our announcement for LFP bringing that to North America is a big deal from a profit standpoint.
That is a very important chemistry on our road map for profitability.
We're going to be installing 60 -- 40-gigawatt hours in North America.
That's a lot.
And we are not going to wait until that installed capacity is here.
We're going to be bringing those batteries to our highest volume vehicles like next year.
So that's one, but there's distribution.
There's the size of your battery.
You're engineering for low labor content.
And I just don't think we're going to do justice such as series and important topic in the earnings call.
But you can expect a lot of engagement with Ford on this, and this is an incredibly important focus.
This is one of the reasons why we created Model e, to be laser-focused on profitable electric vehicles.
And again, you'll see it all.
John, do you want to add any comments on the segmentation reporting?
"
2360,F,2022,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"No, no.
We don't plan on pulling back.
If anything, the first generation of products has inspired us to go faster.
I think I would just emphasize that how we look at this change in our industry, it's not a change in propulsion.
It's much bigger than that.
It's a change to a vehicle whose differentiation will increasingly be software that you ship to the vehicle.
We now have real experience on the first shippable software to these cars.
The first is ADAS, for sure.
And the second one for us is Ford Pro.
We're shipping telematics to the customer, driver coaching, energy management.
Our attach rate for charging now on our E-Transits, where we're 95% share, it's like 30-plus percent.
So there are a lot of services connected to these vehicles because of the software.
And that's a really big revenue opportunity for us.
When you talk about the base walk to 8%, we're not going to -- as John said, we're not going to go through that here, but I will tell you that LFP has a dramatically different exposure to raw materials than an NCM sell.
Like there's no nickel in it.
So the chemistry strategy for the company and diversifying that is a very key part of our profitability walk.
But I think the most important thing to think about is not that we're investing or not in electric cars.
We're investing in digital products, and we can keep them longer because we don't have to upgrade the upper bodies because they're software-enabled vehicles.
There's so much we can do to change the profit profile of these vehicles.
The biggest thing we have to solve for in all of that is the battery cost, and we can't wait to take you through all of that.

Great.
Thanks for taking my questions.
I just wanted to circle back to the first question going from the first half to the second half.
The outlook dividend point is about flat.
You highlighted, I think, [inaudible] volume.
I think the commodities is over $1 billion in [inaudible] Q1 and Q2.
You highlighted about $1 billion of Ford Credit sort of -- that's about $3 billion is good news.
You didn't quantify the bad news.
And currency, it doesn't seem like something to be that material.
Any sort of framing it, is that $3 billion inflationary cost predominantly in the second half? Is that [inaudible]?
"
2363,F,2022,2,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,1,"OK.
And to follow up, I know you clearly are going to give more details on the EV perspective and how you're going to assess things.
But you're talking a pretty dramatic increase in raw material costs.
I think even in your comments, you indicated that only about 50% of the materials are going to be available to produce all the EV targets, which kind of would imply that prices of these raw materials would actually remain high.
Should you be thinking about pulling back on some of the EV investments if the economics at this point are unclear?
"
2364,F,2022,2,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,2,"OK, good.

2366,F,2022,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, guys.
I wanted to ask a somewhat mundane question first on the outlook and then get into some pricing secondarily.
But first, John, when you look at it, the seasonality of Ford's earnings traditionally is higher in the first half, lower in the second half.
There's timing of cost and volume that usually drive that.
Why do you think it's going to be different this year? And I guess maybe one of the big things that might be developing as we get later this year into early next year is that raw mats seem like they may be easing and fading, but the price/mix opportunities seems like it will be pretty strong.
So that might help late this year and early next year.
But just curious if you can comment if there's some of that change in a seasonal pattern so we can be comfortable with our estimates in the second half or your outlook in the second half.
"
2367,F,2022,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"That's very helpful.
And then, Jim, just on these higher trim levels or pseudo special additions, I mean there's Ford Raptor, I mean, the F-150 Raptor R, pretty great-looking truck.
You guys put in the slide deck there, looking forward to driving that, hopefully, sometime soon.
But it seems like there's a real opportunity in Ford Blue, but there might be in Model e for these high trim level special -- sort of special editions.
I mean how much of an opportunity is there on mix go forward maybe in both divisions? And how do you think about going after that? Because that seems like that's something you could be a lot more sustainable than maybe just the supply/demand imbalance we have right now that's helping price.
"
2368,F,2022,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"Jim, if I could just follow up real quick on the Model e side to create a performance version of like the Mustang Mach-E might theoretically cost a lot less, but you might still be able to charge as much as you might on that delta on a Blue vehicle.
Is that correct? And could we see sort of these specials or trim levels potentially garner even higher variable margin as we move into the Model e world? Is that a fair statement or not?

2371,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Jim.
During the quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion, an EBIT margin of 9.3%, and free cash flow of $3.6 billion.
Our cash conversion in the quarter was very strong and lifting our first half to 50%, with the target range of 50% to 60% that we set out at capital markets day.
We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $29 billion and $45 billion, respectively.
And now these numbers include our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $2 billion at the end of the quarter.
In Q2, we also successfully renewed our $17.2 billion sustainability-linked global credit facilities, which include a new $1.75 billion 364-day revolver, which provides for additional working capital flexibility.
Our strong balance sheet is a solid foundation for continuing to invest in our Ford+ priorities.
Our results this quarter reflect the improved earnings and cash flow potential of our business, along with leverage created from disciplined capital allocation and a much more focused business model, including our industrial footprint.
The tough choices we made during the global redesign to de-risk our business and exit unprofitable markets and products is paying off.
From 2018 to 2021, our markets outside North America consumed nearly $9 billion of free cash flow.
This year, these markets are collectively expected to be free cash flow positive.
We are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to fund all the calls of capital -- all the calls that we have on capital, especially those fundamental to growth and value creation.
We can achieve this while maintaining the financial flexibility to navigate external uncertainties.
And as a result, we're increasing our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 a share beginning this quarter.
This returns us to the pre-pandemic dividend levels.
Now let me touch on the performance of our business units.
North America delivered $3.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 11.3%.
Both of those measures were up year over year as an 89% increase in wholesales and strong net pricing and mix more than offset higher commodity costs and inflationary pressures.
South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering its fourth consecutive profitable quarter.
In Europe, we posted a modest profit as a large increase in wholesales helped us reach just above breakeven EBIT.
The underlying trajectory of the region continues to improve.
However, the adverse effects of the near-term supply chain disruption are dampening its overall results.
In China, we posted a loss as the local economy and auto industry were significantly disrupted by pandemic-related restrictions and lockdowns.
Now Lincoln continues to be a profit pillar for the region, gaining share in the quarter, along with commercial vehicles.
Our international markets group continues to be sustainably profitable as a result of its restructuring efforts.
In Mobility, we are progressing our in-market pilots for moving goods and moving people and remain committed to autonomous driving.
And finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of $900 million, reflecting strong lease residuals and credit loss performance.
Now let me share with you our current thinking for the remainder of 2022.
For the full year, our guidance is unchanged.
We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, which is up 15% to 25% from 2021.
This reflects 10% to 15% year-over-year growth in wholesales and assumes that semiconductor availability continues to improve.
In addition, we're projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion, with a significant portion of that coming from automotive operations.
Relative to adjusted EBIT on a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America, collective profitability in the rest of the world, strong but lower Ford Credit EBT, they'll be in the $3 billion range, and modest improvements in Mobility and corporate other.
Other key assumptions include strong order banks and pent-up demand for our new and iconic products, continued strength in pricing, which includes the benefits of pricing actions taken during the year, commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset with improvements in net pricing and mix, a continuation of other broad-based inflationary pressures, and we now expect the full effect to be about $3 billion, which is up $1 billion from our estimate last quarter.
And of course, we're aggressively working on offsets to these increases.
And finally, at Ford Credit, auction values will remain strong but decline in the second half as the supply of new vehicles improve.
EBT will be strong but lower, reflecting primarily lower credit loss reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles, and more normalized credit losses.
Our results in the quarter, full year outlook, and commitment to medium-term targets together demonstrate the power of Ford+ as we invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation.
But before we turn it to Q&A, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting.
As we shared in March, starting in the first quarter of 2023, we will have three new business segments: Ford Model e, Ford Blue, and Ford Pro, and will no longer report a combined automotive segment.
With Ford Next, which is formerly Mobility, and Ford Credit, this will bring our total reportable operating segments to five.
Now this change will not be a simple pro forma exercise.
It's much more fundamental.
These are true segments with both operating and financial accountability, giving you added transparency on our business.
So to help you prepare for this change, we plan to hold a teach-in early next year prior to releasing our 2022 results.
We will use our revised 2021 results as a template to reflect the new segments.
As part of the teach-in, we also plan to cover business rationale, mechanics of the new reporting structure and how our earnings disclosure and our SEC filings will change.
When we report our fourth quarter and our full year results for 2022, they will be based on our existing reportable segments, and we are targeting to also share at the same time 2022 results that are revised to reflect the new segments.
And so if you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to reach out to Lynn and the rest of the IR team.
So that wraps up our prepared remarks.
We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds.
Thank you.
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] And the first question will come from John Murphy from Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
"
2372,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
So, John, it is different, right? Ever since we've had COVID and coming out of COVID, the patterns just haven't held.
When you look at the second half versus the first half, I think that would be the best way to help kind of frame this up.
We do see continued volume, mix, and pricing being strong on a half-over-half basis.
And of course, we do expect to see commodities improve a bit as well in the second half on a half-over-half basis.
And so volume, pricing, and mix, let's say, in the $3 billion range.
Commodities could be as much as $0.5 billion.
But the inflation that we're seeing, that's going to continue to run through.
And we're seeing that across the board from material costs, freight, fuel costs, etc.
So we see that continuing, and that's up, as I said in my remarks, versus what we had talked about at the end of the last quarter.
And then, of course, FMCC is going to be down slightly half-over-half, let's say, $0.80 billion to $1 billion as they approach $3 billion for the year.
We're also seeing headwinds in the second half, John, from currency, the dollar strengthening.
And we have more revenue exposure overseas than we do costs.
So we're going to see some of that happen as well.
And then we're going to continue to invest in our growth, and that'll be an area of engineering.
We'll also see increasing investments in connectivity and spending.
And then, I guess, the last thing I would talk about just to make the half over half complete.
We did have some one-time items come to us in the second quarter, roughly an insurance claim and a contract we renegotiated, which roughly would be maybe three-tenths, four-tenths of headwind.
So that's basically how we frame up the half-over-half.
And basically, what we're saying is that there'll be some headwinds and some tailwinds, but we're confident in our guidance of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.
"
2373,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,
2374,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
Thanks, Rod.
So we have seen strength in volume -- pricing due to the volume that we can produce as an industry and us at Ford relative to the demand that we're seeing out there.
So that has been a tailwind.
In the quarter, we did see quite a bit of a tailwind from mix as well.
Affordability is something that we keep in front of us all the time with the credit company, and we're very thoughtful about where it's headed from the standpoint to the consumer, what's affordable, etc.
But we have not seen demand come off at this point.
But we have -- as we increase volumes through the second half of the year, as some of the chip constraints ease and we see a better rate and flow, we do have provisioned in our second half incentives increasing as volumes come back.
And we've always said that the relationship between volume and pricing is going to remain dynamic.
And so I think what you'll see is as volume comes back, you will see some pricing get back.
You will see prices come down some.
Question for all of us is how are we going to manage stocks? How are we going to move to the build-to-order process? How are we going to change the dynamics and not have as much of a push system and have more of a natural demand system and fulfilling that demand on a timely basis? So I think that's the question for all of us, and we need to maintain discipline as we head into an environment where we could potentially see demand come off and/or we start to have higher supply, and therefore, prices will come well.
But remember, following up on what Adam just said in the dealer margins, we still have -- across the industry, dealer margins that need to come down first from a pricing standpoint, right? We did -- as we've talked about in the past, we took an action which reduced floor plan for the dealers, which was a form of pricing for us.
But overall, it's still inflated.
And I'd estimate somewhere between $1,300 to $1,700 of dealer margin compression is to come off first from a pricing standpoint.
"
2375,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"No, there wasn't anything unusual, Rod.
I'll start with that.
It's across the board.
It's in the areas you would expect, material cost going up.
We're seeing increases in freight.
It's just across the board, and it's driven by the inflationary pressures we're seeing across the board in the economy.
Nothing unusual.
"
2376,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"No.
Yeah, in segmentation reporting, you'll see exactly where we're at between the five businesses.
And Emmanuel, we know how important that is.
So when we have our capital markets day early next year, we'll unpack that in more detail, as Jim said, where we can spend some time on it and go through it and give it due justice.
"
2377,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yeah.
So, Emmanuel, we spent a lot of time on this, as you would expect us to be doing, modeling scenarios, looking at what that means for the business, looking at what we should be doing today to get out in front of any these types of issues if a recession were to come.
But the way we're thinking about it is if you step back and look at where we're at today relative to where we've been as a company, heading into any -- what could be a potential downturn, right, we're in much better shape.
You mentioned it from a demand standpoint.
We have three years of pent-up demand, and we have a very strong product lineup.
And so that's a positive.
We're also at a point right now where incentives are low, right? They're in the single digits versus what normally, at this point in the cycle, we'd probably be in high teens.
And so of course, as volume or demand comes off, there will be some pricing that will need to be given back.
And that's a bit of a release valve, if you will.
But it's really important for us to be thoughtful about that, not only Ford, but as an industry.
And then the other thing I would say, and I mentioned it in my remarks, our business is very different than what it was in the past.
Our ICE product, clearly, it's more -- our lineup is more profitable as we've exited unprofitable vehicles.
But we've de-risked the overall business.
We restructured our markets overseas.
And I think a great proof point for that is the fact that between '18 and '21, we burned through $9 billion of free cash flow overseas.
We're not in that position now.
And we do expect this year, we're projecting that our overseas markets will be free cash flow positive.
So we're just in a completely different position.
We're modeling it.
We're looking at it.
We're getting out in front of things, as Jim said, that we can today.
But it's a new day every day.
But that's how we're thinking about it.
We're clear-eyed.
We understand what we're facing.
We understand what could potentially be in front of us, and now we need to work it.
"
2378,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yes.
So Colin, let me clarify.
It's really hard to hear you.
It's quite static-y.
But Ford Credit will be about $3 billion in total profits for the year.
So that will be down half over half.
So that's a headwind.
And the inflationary costs on a half over half are a headwind.
And so when you walk through it, yes, there will be some volume.
We said that volumes in the second half will be up roughly in the low 20 percentage range versus the first half, and so you've got some mix improvement as well.
So volume and pricing and mix are the tailwinds.
A little bit of a tailwind on commodities, but the headwinds are FMCC profits.
They'll be down.
We've got the inflationary pressures we talked about, will be an increase in the second half.
We also have exchange that's hitting us in the second half relative to the first half.
So that's a headwind as well.
And then we had some one-timers in the second quarter that aren't going to repeat.
And of course, we're going to continue to invest in the business.
So there's going to be spending-related costs.
There's going to be connectivity costs that will be increasing as well as we invest.
So those are the puts and takes.
Those are the tailwinds and the headwinds as you look at it from a half-over-half basis.
And I hope that helps clarify things.
"
2379,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"So we had -- it's $1 billion higher than what we had talked about previously, Joe.
So we're looking at about $3 billion for the year, and that's part of what we're doing.
We're working to offset those inflationary costs, and that's something that we need to continue to work through.
We're not all the way there, of course, but we're working on it, and we do have the rest of the year to go, and it is a significant focus of our team, as we've talked about.
But the cost efforts are a significant focus of the team as we remake the company in Ford+.
So that's a really important part of what we're doing.
And so it's $3 billion for the year.
We had said $2 billion.
We've seen about another $1 billion come through, and it's across the board.
"
2380,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
I think we do see it coming off some.
Part of what complicates the commodity situation is as we go through in a year, we lock into contracts, and they roll.
That protects us on the up when prices are increasing some, but it also has a lag effect when prices are coming down some.
And so we'll have to deal with that as we run through the year as well.
And so I think, really, it's going to depend on what happens with the overall macroeconomic environment.
If we do see us tripping into more of a recessionary period, we should see those fall quicker like we have in the past.
If not, I think that they'll come down more moderately.
So we're planning and looking at both of those scenarios from a spot standpoint.
It is good news as we roll through next year, but you can't just take that spot good news and roll it through everything because we do have contracts that were locked into on a rolling basis through the year.
"
2381,F,2022,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Yeah.
So 53,000 entering the quarter.
The team did a good job on the drawdown.
We're down to 18,000 at the end of the quarter, and we'll work to get those out over the second half of the year as we can free up the chips that impacted us.
I think when you look at the volumes, in the second quarter, we saw an increase in volumes in North America, which helped drive the strong performance for North America.
When you look at the second half, as we said, volumes would be up in the low 20% range compared with the first half.
But that volume growth -- there's greater volume growth in the overseas markets in the second half than in North America.
We have the Ranger launching in IMG.
We have volume in the second half growing at a quicker rate in Europe.
And then, of course, China was significantly depressed from a volume standpoint in the second quarter due to the shutdown.
And so that's what will be happening from a standpoint.
But when you look at the volumes for Q3, they'll be lower than they will be in Q4 because, in Q4, we should see the rate fall, the chips improve as we go through the third quarter into the fourth quarter.
So that's how the volume is framing up in the second half relative to the first half, and then the walk from Q2 into Q3.
So volume and mix in Q3 -- Q3 is going to be less than Q2, right? It's not going to be as strong as Q2.
We have a couple of things hitting us in Q3.
Volume and mix, most of the volume growth in Q3 relative to Q2 is going to be in Europe and China.
And then we still have commodity costs hitting us, and we're investing in connectivity.
And our spending will -- in the third quarter, Ford Credit, of course, as the second half is lower than the first half.
You see that come through in the third quarter.
And then we have the non-repeat of the one-timers I talked about in the second quarter.
So third quarter will be down compared to the second quarter.
Volume increases will be overseas.
And then as we get to the fourth quarter, volume in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis will be better than the third quarter.
"
2382,F,2022,2,james-picariello,exane-bnp-paribas,True,0,"Hey, guys.
Just for commodities, at current spot rates, just as a theoretical exercise, right, if we take into account the lagging effect to your P&L, can you just think about maybe directionally just what commodities -- what the commodities impact would look like for next year at current spot rates?
"
2383,F,2022,2,james-picariello,exane-bnp-paribas,True,1,"OK, understood.
And then just with respect to the cadence for the second half, I mean, how should we be thinking about the quarterly volume -- the volume ramp in the back half? And can you provide color on Ford's progress in shipping the unbilled inventory, I think, totaled 53,000 entering the quarter?

2386,F,2022,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Hi.
Thank you, Jim, and appreciate the old-school lesson reference.
It didn't get by me.
The -- I just want to -- John, can we just go over -- so $3 billion of other inflationary costs, it's $2 billion higher than before.
Are you -- I know you're working to offset it.
Are you assuming you offset that delta in the guide? And maybe you could just let us know how much of that was already incurred in the first half.
"
2387,F,2022,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"OK.
The second question is just on Ford Credit.
So you're pointing to a lower second half, which, if you annualize that, would get you to something in the low 2s.
Is that a good base to think about next year and go forward? Because if we look at the pre-tax ROE in this business, it's been well above average, and I think we understand why there's been some unusual circumstances.
But is that the right way that you're thinking about it that to return to sort of more normal or historical returns? Or is there anything structural under -- in fact, Ford Credit that's changed the profitability profile?
"
2388,F,2022,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,2,"OK.
Thanks very much.

2390,F,2022,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,0,"Thank you so much.
My first question, I was hoping to ask you about the topic of EV profitability.
So Jim, during the quarter at an investor conference, I think you essentially gave some pretty good color on where Ford is standing right now.
And I think you spoke about the cost of the Mach-E being a disadvantage of $25,000 to $27,000 versus a similarly Continental or Edge.
So I guess my questions would be, how do you plan on offsetting this over time? I guess what is the strategy going forward? And should we worry about large losses from EVs in the near term over the next few years as the EV volumes increase materially over the next few years?
"
2391,F,2022,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"OK.
That's fair.
So let me ask you a separate topic then.
So I think one of the hardest things for investors here is to try to perform a sensitivity for a downturn scenario as consumer comes under more pressure, risk of recession increase.
What could that do for not so much volume because, obviously, we've been -- auto has been operating at low volume for a while, supply driven, but pricing.
Any thoughts you could share with us either based on history or in the current context on how would you go about flexing down vehicle pricing in a downturn scenario?

This is Marion here.
Thanks for the question.
You're thinking about it correctly.
So if you go back to pre-COVID, and balance sheet was quite a bit larger, we were at about $145 billion at that time.
We were at a run rate of about $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion of EBT.
And so that was the normal level.
Our balance sheet is somewhat smaller now.
And so I think what you're seeing is a more normalized level of profits.
We're back at our pre-COVID reserve level.
We're not releasing reserves and as it relates to lease residuals, that's pretty much worked its way through its book.
So you're seeing that more normal performance.

2396,F,2019,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hello, everybody, and congrats to Bob from us well, really enjoyed working with you over the years and I do wish you the best.
I'm interested in just following up on some of the questions about China and the China plan.
You had $160 million of structural cost reduction year-over-year in the quarter and it seemed like a lot of the restructuring that you were pursuing actually started late in the quarter.
There was a shift, for example, to Nanjing from Shanghai.
Can you talk a little bit about what we should be expecting going forward, what the magnitude of the structural cost reduction could be to correspond with your plan?
"
2397,F,2019,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"So just to clarify, is this the run rate of year-over-year cost reduction or do you anticipate that it actually increases from here?
"
2398,F,2019,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"Got you.
And just broadly on strategy.
Maybe this is a question for Farley.
You're consolidating in almost every region the segments that have very strong brand equity.
So in Europe you're going to be mostly in commercial trucks in the Ranger, on South America presumably at some point a lot of it's going to be pickup trucks, and in North America let out what you guys are emphasizing now is brand -- is products with very strong brand equity that's established.
China is obviously very different.
There -- it seems like there are a lot of new products, it's expanding pretty widely.
Obviously, it's a tough market.
It's a fragmented market and you're a 2% player there.
So could you just maybe from a 30,000 foot view, just help us understand what you want to be in this region, how broad do you want to be, and what kind of investment you're willing to put behind that?

Before I begin the formal comments tonight, I want to extend a very warm welcome to Tim Stone who joined Ford Motor Company on April 15th.
Tim will assume the role of CFO on June 1st and we could not be more excited to have Tim join our team at such an important time in our transformation.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Bob Shanks.
Bob has left an indelible mark on this company in his 40-plus-year career.
As CFO, he's been relentless in driving for results and pushing the company to greater heights.
He's also been a wonderful colleague who's led with integrity.
Now this part's off-script, as great as a CFO that Bob has been for Ford Motor Company, he's an extremely wonderful human being.

Okay.
So let me turn to our results, which we believe signal positive momentum for Ford.
Our solid results this quarter, if you look at Slide 2 and the recent strategic initiatives, demonstrate two things in our minds.
First, we have a solid plan to create value in the near and long term.
2018 was a pivotal year for Ford as we mapped out a fundamental redesign of our entire company and this was required to ensure we could simultaneously strengthen our core business, while making the necessary investments to be a successful player in the future.
We know that the industry, our industry, is entering a period of profound disruption and reinvention.
Second, we're taking action, moving decisively and building momentum on this global redesign of our company.
2019 is a year of action as we target sustained improvement across key metrics, including growth, profitability, cash flow and returns on capital.
Now if you look at Slide 3, which is titled 2019 A Year of Action, let me focus on some of the key enablers.
Let's start with the winning portfolio.
Across the world, we're fortifying our franchise strengths in trucks, commercial vehicles and performance vehicles, and bolstering our SUV franchise, executing the unique approach to electric vehicles that takes advantage of our strongest nameplates.
And as you saw a year ago, we're phasing out vehicles that cannot grow and deliver the strong returns that are needed.
And as you see -- as you will see when Bob reviews our results, these actions are already driving improved mix with higher average transaction prices and margins.
If you look there at fitness, I've often referred to this as the state of our ability to compete.
We are improving operating leverage, we're lowering our breakeven, and we have reallocated capital to higher return investments.
For example, over our plan period globally we now expect to dedicate 91% of our capital to trucks, utilities and crossovers.
And we will achieve this while we also lower the capital intensity of the whole business.
We expect these actions to drive higher operating cash flow and that will be led by Automotive.
An essential part of fitness for Ford is partnerships and to this end we've advanced our alliances, as you know, both with VW and Mahindra.
And yesterday we were proud to announce a partnership with Rivian.
Next, I want to focus on our global redesign.
We are accelerating this.
Our recent announcements in Western Europe, Russia and South America as well as the redesign of our global management structure show how we are rationalizing our cost structure, our portfolio and footprint to ensure the company overall in each of our regions drive sustainable profitable growth.
I want to touch on this a bit more in just a moment.
Finally, as you look at the Smart Vehicles For A Smart World, we have the opportunity to help create a better transportation system that will improve lives.
To this end, we made the decision to connect with modems, virtually all of our new vehicles going forward and to leverage this connectivity to continuously improve our vehicles and services and create better experiences for our customers.
We know this will build loyalty and deliver recurring revenue streams.
Well, for your information, by the end of this year, 100% of new vehicles sold in the US will be equipped with those modems and by 2020 90% of our new vehicles globally will also be equipped with modems.
So, in parallel, we're laying building blocks in the form of platforms to help us realize the vision in -- on the Smart Vehicles For A Smart World.
Examples include Autonomic's Transportation Mobility Cloud or we nicknamed it the TMC.
This is the world's leading Automotive cloud.
Earlier this week, we announced a global agreement with Amazon for our TMC to be powered by Amazon Web Services.
This is great news, because it expands the availability of cloud connectivity services and connected car application development services for the whole transportation industry.
In addition, we launched FordPass rewards.
Now FordPass has been downloaded 6.4 million times and we now have 3.8 million members signed up.
We do expect the growth of these members to accelerate.
We also announced FordPass Pro.
This is for our fleet vehicle customers.
Returning to autonomous vehicles.
We've selected a third city for business operations and commercial deployment, and we expect to announce the location later this year.
Also, Argo AI recently received a license to test AVs in California, making it the fifth state we're now testing in.
If we can move you to Slide 4 and you see announcements at the top.
Here are some of the major initiatives we have announced or taken so far this year.
Our North American operation continues to move closer to its longer-term EBIT margin of 10% with action to enhance effectiveness and reduce costs.
The North American business will also benefit this year from a significant wave of product launches that includes some wonderful badges for us, Ranger, Super Duty, Explorer and Escape, as well as exciting new entries for Lincoln.
In fact, by the end of 2020, we will have replaced 75% of our current US product lineup.
We've also taken action to increase production of Expedition and Navigator in Kentucky for the second time to keep up with continued strong demand, it's over 40% greater than what we had planned.
We announced we're expanding the battery electric and AV capacity in Michigan, and we'll optimize costs by building the next-generation Transit Connect for North America, in Mexico instead of Spain.
You can see the progress we're making on our first quarter results as North America drove a 2% increase in revenue, despite lower industry sales and wholesale volume.
And at the same time, it achieved the 90 basis point increase in EBIT margin to 8.7%.
In South America, we're moving to a more asset-light business model.
The team has made some significantly tough decisions.
One was to exit heavy trucks and close our facility in Sao Bernardo.
Through our collective approach and collaborative approach, we're working to minimize the near-term impact on all of our stakeholders.
We're also deep now in the redesign of our European business as we have targeted a sustainably profitable business that delivers a 6% EBIT margin.
Our future business there will be leaner, more focused and that will capitalize on profitable franchises strengths in commercial vehicles and utilities.
We plan to significantly reduce our cost base there by discontinuing loss-making product lines and adjusting our manufacturing footprint.
For example, we've announced the closure of our Bordeaux, France transmission plant.
We announced the restructuring of our JV in Russia.
We've offered separation programs in Germany and the UK, and we confirmed we'll phase out two of these products the C-MAX and C-MAX Grand models later this year.
If you look at Slide 6, I want to just take you back to a decision we made a year ago when we announced our decision to phase out sedans in North America.
Now, remember, we want customers to understand the silhouettes that they prefer are the ones we're going to bring them.
So, in fact, we don't intend to lose any of these customers long term.
And now in hindsight, it was absolutely the right call.
This slide underscores the benefit of thinking about a winning portfolio.
We expect to drive over $1 billion improvement in annual profitability from our Michigan assembly plant once we fully ramp production for the Ranger and Bronco that are now being built there.
Okay.
Let's look at Slide 7, and here I want to cover the financial highlights and before I turn it over to Bob let me touch on the quarter.
We delivered good results and this is consistent with our view now that we will deliver better company results in 2019 than last year.
Against the tough quarterly year-over-year comparison, the company-adjusted EBIT and margin increased despite a decline in wholesales and revenue, while we increased investments for future opportunities in Mobility.
On an adjusted basis, we grew EBIT by 12% to $2.4 billion.
Margin increased 90 basis points to 6.1% led by 8.7% EBIT margin that I mentioned in North America.
We also delivered EPS of $0.44, which we're happy with the big beat there but were also up year-over-year.
These results clearly demonstrate the benefit of our fitness actions, a hard portfolio decisions and the aggressive business redesigns, all of which are still very much under way and we expect more to be generated from all these actions.
Lastly, we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted operating cash flow and ended the quarter above our cash and liquidity targets with $24.2 billion in cash and $35.2 billion in total liquidity.
Needless to say, I and the team here are very encouraged by the strong start to the year.
With that, let me turn this call over to Bob Shanks for his last quarterly review as Chief Financial Officer.
Bob?
"
2406,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Yes.
Thank you, David.
This is something that we've talked a great deal about and I think I'm delighted with where Ford is relative to what's happened in Europe.
I'll let Jim share more here.
"
2407,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
I just want to remind everybody that this is on the consolidated part of the business.
So just to simplify what need to think about, so that's the net engineering, so that's the engineering we incurred net of the royalties we've received as the vehicles are produced.
It is the import business, both Lincoln brand and Ford brand.
It's the overhead of the team that's there in Shanghai.
There's also a portion, which is a component sales that we ship the components into the JVs and so that's a piece of it as well.
So I'm just talking not about what's happening in the JVs, which is where the bulk of the business is, but in that portion I just described.
And so, what we've been focusing on is driving down costs as quickly as we can.
We've seen less engineering, less manufacturing expense from -- this is also fitness right, this is fitness of Ford on the imported vehicles that's now benefiting China, those vehicles go over.
Certainly, Anning Chen has been thrifting out and addressing the size of the workforce in Shanghai.
That's an opportunity that's probably more ahead of us in the quarter, but it has begun.
So it's really broad-based, it's not any one thing, it's across the board, but the results have been very encouraging in the first quarter.
And I would expect kind of look at the full year, but that would be an important element of what will be the improvement of the loss that we had last year in China relative to what we delivered this year.
"
2408,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"I think, it's pretty representative.
It's going to be plus or minus.
"
2409,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Thank you, Rod.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.
"
2410,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"And Steven I got to slip this in, because I don't know how close you've been to Ford, but the management team that's running North America is exceptional Kumar Galhotra was put in that job and we're just reviewing today kind of their serial quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter kind of improvement that they've generated.
In fact, he from a method standpoint was one of the first parts of the world to build this new flat agile structure with these energy rooms.
This is all serious commitment to moving faster and moving collegially across the company, reducing bureaucracy and it's been copied.
And now I just add that the people leading the other parts of the world have similar kind of talent.
So when Bob just talked to you about the way to think about the rest of the year, I was thinking about the guy running it and want to make sure you know how solid he is.
"
2411,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Yes, I think where we are today is consistent message that I've said that we have the right or wrong design in these markets.
And so, you're seeing us tackle both in Europe and South America as examples that are now playing now.
As Jim Farley has talked about the portfolio strategy there, we're working on a better design for South America.
And that's more to come there, but these initiatives to get us in shape so that we have the right cost structure and all that, we'll be followed by really the right kind of things to win in those markets with where we want to play them with.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.
"
2412,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Well, we've worked hard on both of those.
"
2413,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"So the parallel, Joe -- the parallel is that, it couldn't have been better coincidence which is at the time we're trying to figure out the redesign in Europe and the product portfolio going forward, we were aware of this kind of influence.
So, we've been addressing that all along in the strategies.
"
2414,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Well, we have the option of doing that.
And in fact in couple of the disclosures we've made over the last -- what a year or two? We've provided sort of segments and things of that sort, trucks or whatever high-performing products.
So we're starting to show you more on a product line basis.
I don't know where that will go frankly.
As you know, one of the big changes in our organization has been to provide a much -- I call the third leg of the stool of the lens on the business.
We've got central.
We've got core teams' regions.
Now, we're going to have a much stronger product line focused, that's our EPL-amortization (ph) that Jim and Bob talked about at the conference last week or so.
So I think -- and my comments give you a little bit more texture than what we have in the past.
The improvement in North America was driven by the trucks.
But I have to tell you also the improvement was driven by the fact that decision we made around the passenger sedan.
That was hundreds of millions of dollars or will be over the course of the year.
So that's not immaterial, but it's something that we have the option of doing, I suppose.
It's not how we report the business, but we will be very thoughtful going forward, Itay, in terms of what we do with this information to and for our investors going forward.
But clearly and I know your thesis and we don't disagree with that.
Ford Motor Company has a moat of trucks, particularly F-Series but not just F-Series.
We're the biggest player in the world on vans.
The Ranger we're number two or three depends on how you cut it and that's without North American in the mix and now we're going to combine forces to some extent with VW, who is also a strong player.
So more to come I guess on that.
"
2415,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Yeah.
I appreciate that, Itay.
I think -- let me, I'm going to ask Marcy Klevorn to help me with this, because she and I just were in Pittsburgh two days ago for a full day reviewing with Jim Farley kind of our developments there.
I want to report this -- what a great team we have in Argo AI and take you back to Miami.
When we brought investors and media there, I think we got at large really thumps up from the experience -- intentional is the fact that we're testing in some really challenging areas.
I mean, I don't want to pick on any competitor, because it's not my purpose but you could put these vehicles in places where the weather never changes, there's not a lot of intense urban kind of challenges, mostly everyone's retired and the road stone change a lot.
I mean we've opted into some really difficult settings to prove this capability.
So Miami's going really well, Washington D.C.
all of us on the call and the table have been in that city, so you know the challenges.
And in fact the long-term viability of this capability is it's ability to work in cities.
And so that's why I think you're going to love the Ford position.
Now to the direct part of your question in how we're picking cities and where we are going from here I'll let Marcy fill in what the plans have been.
"
2416,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Thanks, John.
No, I don't think there's any shift at all.
In fact, if I take you back to this regime's arrival in June of 2017, one of the first things that we attacked was the product portfolio.
In fact, this recent organization where Jim Farley and Joe take on respectively new roles, I've explained at the company that we weren't ready for this current organization back in June of 2017, because we had to get the product in shape.
And Jim Farley and Joe and Hau, they did an incredible job in very fast order getting that turned around.
If you think about the essence of that like is it in competition with the future, it's not, because as we're turning the product around we're thinking about the design of Smart Vehicles For A Smart World.
What do they have to actually be capable of doing to enable the future things that we're seeing, including autonomy, connectivity and cloud-based interactions with cities.
So all three of those things were -- are in our thinking.
So what's nice is that the improvement in the product portfolio is fueling, of course, the good news tonight, because that's what Ford stands for and it didn't depreciate any of the investment or effort in the future tech that's all alive and well.
"
2417,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Yeah.
We laughed and if autonomy was only destined for the LA freeways, you don't have to deal with dogs and baseballs running across them and no need to recognize that.
And so the argument that you see in the press about how intense the LIDAR commitment has to be is a function of that.
It's our intent to have these things perform really safely, as I've said.
Another interesting thing is that, we've been intentional about the way we think about the external environment in the vehicle relating to each other.
And I've been on record at the CES Talk a year ago describing how cities are going to be communicating back to the vehicles and vice versa.
We're experimenting with that in all these tests.
So there's a lot more in terms of the system's evolution that I think is going to be wonderful to talk about as we get there.
"
2418,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Thank you.
And before we close again, I want to welcome Tim.
Bob, thank you for an incredible service.
I want to reinforce four key points.
First, we have a solid plan to create value in the near and long term.
We believe we're gaining credibility with you that we're doing as we said.
We also -- as we said, this was the year of action and making these decisions, building momentum with the global redesign of the company as we target sustained improvement across key metrics.
And we're mindful of growth, profitability, cash flow and returns as we do that.
Third, our results this quarter could clearly demonstrate the benefit of fitness actions, portfolio decisions that we've labored over and the business redesigns.
And we do want to assert that there's more to come there.
And, fourth, we want you to know that we really do believe we've delivered a solid quarter.
It's not just one thing, it's across the board.
And we now believe we're on track to deliver better company results for this full year and recognize in parallel that we have a lot of work ahead of us.
So, thank you for joining the call tonight.

Colin, I just want to emphasize, because this is important in the trust that I build with you guys, is we've been very consistent with what we've started with the fitness initiatives in terms of our target and where we are.
So I'll let Bob fill in the blanks, but there's not a lot of shifts here from what we've been talking about.

And our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.
"
2423,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"Ryan, Jim Hackett here.
I just -- I take my gaze a little further on the horizon with China as you might imagine.
And the earlier question that John asked about products and was that kind of a new leg under our stool, it's not.
But I would admit that as we were rationalizing that product portfolio what became clear to me is that our position in China had -- send it very quickly from where we started to where we hit at the peak was a function of we knew what the market was, but we lost track of that and we lost track of it in a way that was going to take advantage of the things that John was asking you about.
It seems like you guys are getting your act together on the product portfolio.
So we're applying what we've learned about getting the portfolio in shape as we start to fix China.
So there's a longer-term opportunity here that we've got to prove to you that this team that really, I think, understands product and we've got a wonderful leadership team there.
I just want to warrant to you that there's going to be better solutions in China for Ford than we're seeing right now.
"
2424,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Are we at peak trucks? What's interesting and Jim Farley I know I think is the one you're after.
"
2425,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,21,"Okay.
I don't think so, because we've -- in the face of some really good competition, we're doing very well, Adam, as you can tell.
And Jim talk about where we are in the Series evolution right now, what we've been winning with versus what we're going to have.
"
2426,F,2019,1,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,22,"Thanks, Adam.
And you know I love the question, because like some of the comments tonight this was one of the early things that we actually went after, which is in the fitness initiative.
Joe Hinrichs, who is going to take this, and I have long talks about product complexity and how getting that right would start to be the gift that kept on giving.
So, Joe, you might talk about our efforts there and...
"
2427,F,2019,1,colin-langan,ubs,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
Can you just give us the sense that there's been a lot of announcements through the year so far and restructuring actions.
I mean, where are we in terms of what we should expect for the year? I mean, is there more -- is the (technical difficulty) go through the year is most of it that kind of out there and we should start to see the benefits coming? How should we think about what else might be coming on the plan?
"
2428,F,2019,1,colin-langan,ubs,True,1,"That's very helpful.
How about South America? I think in your past presentations you showed that there's -- a profitability there is very tough, there are not many products in that region that are profitable.
When you have the plant closure, have we seen any benefits from that in the quarter? And should we expect more actions considering the challenges in that region?
"
2429,F,2019,1,colin-langan,ubs,True,2,"Okay.
Thanks for taking my question.
"
2430,F,2019,1,colin-langan,ubs,True,3,
2431,F,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks, everybody.
First, I want to say congrats to Bob.
And Tim, Bob has got the bar set a little higher for you, but don't worry stock -- auto stocks go up 8%, 10% after quarter results, that's very normal, so just get used to it.
So, first question is for Jim.
Are we at peak trucks?
"
2432,F,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Both Jim.
"
2433,F,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"Got it.
Thanks for that.
Second question is on the suppliers.
If global auto production continues to, let's say, flatline, deeper in the cycle and trucks don't provide as much incremental profit as they have up to now, how big is the opportunity for smart redesign, intelligently decontenting or rationalization of powertrain combinations that the consumer really doesn't care about or even noticed, I'd say extract some seriously better pricing or terms in your supply base, who in large part are out-earning you and tell us all the time that OEMs are just going to keep increasing content all the time and that they're just going to keep winning.
Are they wrong? Is there an opportunity for you to kind of -- I don't want to say turn the table, that sounds too adversarial, but just saying, come on, folks, pitch in here, we're going to simplify this and decomplexification can mean decontenting.
How big of an opportunity is that for you? Thanks.
"
2434,F,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,"Thanks, everybody.
"
2435,F,2019,1,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,4,
2436,F,2019,1,marcy-klevorn,"president,-mobility",False,0,"That's a great question.
And as you say some are choosing to focus in a limited geographic location.
And in that regard it might be easier to rack up here like point A to point B miles, where we believe to build on Jim's comments is that complex miles are more important.
And so, we're picking cities, as Jim said, like Miami that are very complex, who does (inaudible) heard Senator Brandes's opening remarks.
He said Miami was a black diamond city, because it has so much going on in the city and we embrace that, napped it, and for those of you that participated or that read about it, saw that it was a (inaudible) show that we could handle complex miles, different types of construction, different types of activity in the city, a bilingual city and doing that well.
So now we are on to D.C.
We've got a third city selected for deployment, which we'll announce later this year, but if they continue to really build out complex miles.
And in conjunction with that, we also do, which is partner with businesses, so we've announced the likes of Postmates and Walmart, we're also partnering with local businesses to become a part of the fabric of this city.
And that helps us learn how cities operate in urban settings, very important, it helps us to learn how to monetize the autonomous vehicles in the future by working with local businesses and these big partnerships.
And then finally it helps inform the SDS self-driving system software in addition.
And that's really important, because over time as standards emerge and legislation takes place, pieces of that will have to be codified and those pieces in the SDS will become a commodity like happens over time in technology.
And so, because we're learning these complex situations, because we're learning how we might monetize working with these businesses, we will be left with some IP that will help us set us apart.
And then, finally, to build on Jim Hackett's idea around human-centered design.
It helps us really to learn more about in these complex situations how humans want to interact with the vehicle and help us build those human-centric use cases into our thinking and into our testing.

2439,F,2019,1,ryan-brinkman,jp-morgan-chase-&-co.,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my questions.
It looks like the faster than many expected improvement in China was really driven by cost and exchange rather than volume.
The JVs on the British (ph) side, I know, are shown as a single bucket.
But Bob you referenced volume being the main negative driver there.
So the question is really, how to think about volume going forward for you in China? How should investors weigh? On the one hand, a still very soft industry with; on the other hand something pretty easy compares in the back half of the year and now this new comment that dealer stocks are in good shape.
So are the product launches enough to allow you to grow in China, even in the current environment?
"
2440,F,2019,1,ryan-brinkman,jp-morgan-chase-&-co.,True,1,"Okay.
Very helpful.
Thanks.
And then just lastly for me.
You've been warning about the sustainability of Ford Credit earnings for sometime now only to see the profit there just continue to inflect higher.
You've been anticipating a normalization in used car prices from some of the data we're able to track.
I thought we started to see that in 1Q, but you continued to record these big off-lease gains.
Does the 1Q profit there cause you to think any differently about full year credit profit potential?

Good evening, I should say, actually.
It's been a long day.
Bob, I just want to say congratulations.
It's been a long great career and I only wish I had something in the slide deck to measure and give you a hard time about, but the results were really good, so congratulations.
But you understand that.
Jim, just a -- first question.
As we look at sort of the discussion tonight in the slides, it seems like you're leaning back a little bit more on product being the core of the company sort of here in the near term and in long term, a little bit more than you have in the past.
I mean, in the past, you've been a little bit more focused on sort of the future tech and the opportunity.
Is something kind of shifting in your thinking here really, maybe it's an 80/20 shift or something like that, because it does seem like product really is king and you're starting to really grasp that a little bit more in the near term and long term opportunities are a little bit more long term.

2444,F,2019,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"Great.
And then just a second question.
I mean price and mix were wildly constructive and positive in the quarter, but maybe if we focused on Slide 25 and I don't know if this is for Joe or Farley, but you have $1.259 billion positive on mix and price in the quarter and we're still staring down the barrel with a lot of product coming out of.
So I'm just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what the key driver is there? Is it the F-Series? Is there something going on with fleet or/and retail? Was there something really constructive maybe on the Super Duty side? Just a very big number and I was just trying to understand what's going on there.
"
2445,F,2019,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"Okay.
"
2446,F,2019,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,"And maybe, if I could, sneak one last one in for Bob.
There's been a lot of speculation about the potential downgrade at Moody's for your credit rating, but with what we've seen in this quarter it seems like that may have been staved off.
I'm just wondering if there's any kind of update in your perception as what's going on there or maybe any update on the metrics we should be focused on as really kind of turning the ship on that negative review right now?
"
2447,F,2019,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,4,"Great.
Congrats again, Bob.
Thank you very much.

2449,F,2019,1,james-farley,"president-of-global-markets-and-new-businesses,-technology-&-strategy",False,0,"Thanks, John.
Look, F-Series is an incredible franchise, John.
We gained share.
We've finished the quarter with 41% share of the pickup truck business.
That's a nine-tens (ph) increase.
We had built a leadership position over the number two player by almost 100,000 units in the quarter.
Our average transaction price was just under $48,000 for F-Series and we have the lowest incentive spend for any of the major trucks.
And that was a big fitness exercise for us in terms of yield management.
One of the big strengths to your point in the first quarter was commercial and government.
We saw 11% growth for us in the first quarter, much higher than the industry.
The sectors that drove that were telecom and utilities.
We saw daily order rates grow.
The strength of Super Duty is really one of the key facets for the quarter.
And obviously we also launched Ranger.
In fact, with Ranger and F-Series together we had our best pickup truck quarter in 15 years.
So, look, we have a lot to do with the very competitive market, but we have a great team and we saw very strong demand for our product.
And, as Bob said, the product portfolios is chockful of new product.
We have the new Super Duty coming later this year and an all-new F-Series next year.
So we've got a great franchise for connectivity services and automation as well.
There's a very strong quarter for our trucks.
"
2450,F,2019,1,james-farley,"president-of-global-markets-and-new-businesses,-technology-&-strategy",False,1,"Well, thanks for your question.
Obviously, we're working really hard to stabilize our sales this year.
We've launched a new product, as you know, and we've gotten very positive pricing.
We do have opportunity for momentum in the second half of the year, but right now we're focused on stabilizing our sales.
It's great to see the profitability improvement for the dealers and the stock.
Stocks have come down, which is really a health measure for us, but right now we're looking at stabilizing our sales.
"
2451,F,2019,1,james-farley,"president-of-global-markets-and-new-businesses,-technology-&-strategy",False,2,"Yeah.
As you know, we updated the F-Series a year or so ago, which was great but we have really strong product coming, so that bodes well for our chances.
For the market in first quarter, I think that the strength for Ford in commercial and government was a really important sign.
We saw sectors, including for the growth of Transit for package delivery, telecom utilities that really drove Super Duty F-Series and Transit sales in the US double-digit growth year-over-year.
So that's a really -- those customers, as you know, are really driven by cost of ownership.
They're very discerning customers.
They want the best capability, but they also want the best efficient -- most efficient vehicle.
And I think that bodes really well.
The other thing to mention is that, in the first quarter, for us, Ranger, we only sold about 10,000.
We're just still ramping up Ranger and that was very strong demand.
I think our average turn is like 18 days now for Ranger and that was incremental to our F-Series.
So, for us, we have a very new product cadence.
We have more coming and the strength of the commercial business is a good sign.
"
2452,F,2019,1,james-farley,"president-of-global-markets-and-new-businesses,-technology-&-strategy",False,3,"Yeah, great question.
Obviously, earlier this month the European team shared our plans to expand electrification from mild hybrids all the way to full electrics and it's a really aggressive plan with 16 electric vehicles.
One of the things that's just such a differentiator for us in Europe is our strength of commercial vehicles.
And so, although there are cost going in for electrification and CO2 compliance, especially for 2025, we're in a really good shape to continue to nurture that commercial vehicle business which is really profitable and has more upside.
For example, in the first quarter, we gained almost 0.5 share point in our commercial business.
So although there are more costs going in in Europe as you say for the more stringent requirements in 2025 with the 15% reduction, we have the opportunity on the commercial side to continue to grow our profitability.
"
2453,F,2019,1,james-farley,"president-of-global-markets-and-new-businesses,-technology-&-strategy",False,4,"No, I'm not going to share that.
"
2454,F,2019,1,james-farley,"president-of-global-markets-and-new-businesses,-technology-&-strategy",False,5,"Well, thanks for your question.
First of all, we have -- I just want to reiterate the ambitions we have to grow our utilities business globally.
We have a great opportunity in North America and in Europe with our utilities.
For China, the story is a growth story.
I mean, as Anning shared last week with his 30/30 plan; in the next three years, we have 30 new products, a lot of those utilities.
You can expect Ford to really lean into utility space.
If you see the success we've had in Territory, which is the new nameplate for us, that's great, but we have the opportunity to localize a lot of utilities in China and also refresh the products that are at the very end of their life cycle.
So you can expect China to be a growth story for Ford over the next several years as well as a lot of localization and a growth in our utility lineup.

Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer.
Also joining us are Jim Farley, President of Global Markets; Marcy Klevorn, President, Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, President, Global Operations; and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to our global redesign and then comment briefly on the quarter.
Bob will follow with a more detailed look at our results, and then we'll turn to Q&A.
Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance.
Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 40.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.
Company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis.
Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.

2461,F,2019,1,steven-hempel,barclays,True,0,"Yes, hi.
This is Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson.
Just wanted to drill down a little bit further into the North American profit improvement here.
Maybe just discuss how to think about the sustainability of North American EBIT for the year and maybe discuss the quarterly cadence throughout.
I suppose maybe a two-part question split up between kind of cost, including the launches, I understand obviously launches are going to ramp up for the remainder of the year but maybe discuss which quarters you expect to see the largest year-over-year headwind from those launch costs? And then secondarily pricing, which has been obviously key strong year-over-year tailwind now for the past two quarters, maybe discuss that business and the key drivers of that North American pricing improvement in the quarter, bucket it up between F-Series yield management and any others we might be missing?
"
2462,F,2019,1,steven-hempel,barclays,True,1,"Yeah, that's definitely helpful.
I guess switching gears here internally a little bit south to South America (technical difficulty) more so specifically the long-term outlook.
Basically to your payback for the current restructuring that's in place, which basically roughly flat or breakeven, which is clearly an improvement from where we're at today.
But how do we think about this business long-term? It's move back in 2014 you mentioned our long-term target of 7% to 9%.
I'm not sure if that's realistic anymore given you're exiting some of the businesses, but maybe this.
And I guess is it more realistic to maybe think that Ford will actually exit South America completely and redeploy capital to higher margin businesses?

2464,F,2019,1,itay-michaeli,citigroup,True,0,"Thank you.
Good evening, And Bob, congrats.
So I wanted to ask a high level question in North America, because this is the third quarter in a row where you're growing EBIT with the declining SAAR.
And clearly a lot of investors (technical difficulty) start the analysis looking at the SAAR when seeing that lot of your profitability has been driven by the F-Series franchise and so forth with the fundamental seem very, very different from SAAR for a long time.
I guess the question is, as you think about how investors might appreciate results like this, what are the merits and the pros and cons to disclosing the F-Series franchise or the pickup truck franchise separately to let investors see kind of what's the key drivers away from the SAAR itself?
"
2465,F,2019,1,itay-michaeli,citigroup,True,1,"That's really helpful, Bob.
And may follow-up -- maybe for Jim on the expansion in the autonomous development to other cities.
I'd love to get a bit more on color on decision behind that.
And the reason I ask this, because some of the -- your other competitors seem to be consolidating testing in like one particular city just to kind make sure that they are able to kind of conquer that city first.
So to get an understanding of kind of decision to expand that, I think you mentioned California testing as well and kind of what going on into that, as well as give us kind of updated size of the testing fleet over the next maybe year or so?
"
2466,F,2019,1,itay-michaeli,citigroup,True,2,
2467,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"I'll keep a blushing face.
"
2468,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Thanks, Jim, and good evening to everyone.
I'd like to start with four key points.
First, the results this quarter are high quality and driven by the key physicals of the business.
Second, while top line metrics were lower than a year ago, the company's revenue decline was driven largely by exchange of strong mix and higher net pricing about offset the lower volume.
And even though market share was lower, we're growing share in trucks and commercial vehicles and expect improved performance in utility segments as we launch new and, in some cases, new-to-market entries over the next couple of years.
Third, company-adjusted EBIT, the best since the second quarter of 2017, improved despite external headwinds of about $0.5 million versus a year ago.
This includes lower industry volume, continued those smaller increases and commodity costs including tariff-related effects and adverse exchange.
This $0.5 billion impact is net of pricing of about $100 million that we took in South America to partially recover the region's adverse inflationary and exchange affects.
Fourth, and most importantly, we saw progress in each of the three regions that drove the year-over-year decline in company EBIT last year; China, Europe and North America, and I'll touch on each one of them.
First, in China, we incurred a loss of $128 million on lower volume.
This was an improvement from the $150 million we lost a year ago, which was by far the best quarterly result in 2018.
In fact to put the current quarter into further context, last year in the second through fourth quarters, our average quarterly loss was $465 million.
So the improvement in China from a year ago was driven by our consolidated operations, offset partially by lower JV equity net income.
The main elements of the consolidated improvement were strong cost performance and favorable exchange, although we also saw favorable mix and achieved flat year-over-year pricing in a negative industry pricing environment.
The favorable currency effect essentially was a reversal of an equivalent adverse impact we incurred in China over the past couple of years.
The lower JV equity net income was entirely due to lower volume.
Importantly, we ended the quarter with dealer stocks in good shape and improving dealer profitability.
While they have a lot of hard work ahead of us in China to return to sustained profitability, we are encouraged by the early progress Anning Chen and his team are making.
So for the full year, we expect to build on the first quarter outcome and deliver a considerable improvement in profitability year-over-year, although still a loss.
In Europe, we were profitable but at lower level than last year, more than explained by nearly $100 million of unfavorable exchange most of which was a balance sheet effect.
Within Europe's results, we delivered strong EBIT and healthy returns for our growing CV and truck business.
This was offset partially by losses on passenger cars, although the latter continue to generate positive current period operating cash flow.
As you are aware, Europe's business redesign is under way and progressing well and we will have more to share with you as the year progresses.
For the full year, we expect to deliver a substantial improvement in profitability versus last year, driven by favorable mix, higher net pricing and lower cost.
Turning to North America.
We achieved our best EBIT since the second quarter of 2018 and, as Jim mentioned, our margin is 8.7%, both improved from last year.
The team achieved this through strong mix and higher net pricing aided by structural costs that were slightly lower than a year ago.
From a product standpoint, North America's EBIT improvement was driven by our F-Series, despite new competitive challenges; Ranger, as it came to market; and Transit, America's best-selling van.
The region's EBIT also benefited substantially from the decision to exit traditional passenger sedans.
The strong financial performance of F-Series was matched by robust performance in the marketplace.
In the quarter and in the face of new competitive entries, F-Series customer sales and average transaction prices held strong from a year earlier, while share of segment increased.
And from here, our plan is to strengthen our position further with the new Super Duty launching later this year, a new F-150 coming in 2020, followed by a BEV relatively soon thereafter.
For the full year, we expect North America's EBIT and margin to improve from 2018.
Now coming up from the regions to our Automotive segment.
We saw improved EBIT from a year ago.
North America's performance flowed straight through to Automotive as the combined loss in regions outside North America was unchanged from the year earlier.
However, this did represent a strong $630 million improvement from the fourth quarter.
Within Automotive, cost was flat year-over-year.
So as a result, we generated strong operating leverage in the quarter which drove a higher Automotive EBIT margin.
For the full year, we expect Automotive EBIT to improve, driven by gains in China, Europe and North America.
Now moving to Financial Services, Ford Credit delivered very strong earnings before taxes, in fact the highest in nearly nine years.
All of Ford Credit's metrics were healthy, including the continued focus on a lean best-in-class operating cost structure.
In the quarter, Ford Credit benefited from lower depreciation on vehicles in our leased portfolio and improvement in credit loss reserves, reflecting continued strength in consumer credit metrics.
For the full year, we now expect EBT at Ford Credit to be about the same as in 2018.
This includes a continued expectation for auction values to decline on average over the year by about 4% at constant mix.
In our Mobility segment, we incurred and increased EBIT loss as we invested more, as planned, to build out our capabilities to win in the future with Mobility services as we leverage the connectivity of our products, while also progressing our developments in autonomy.
For the full year, we expect a larger loss in Mobility as we increase our investment in Mobility services and as our AV efforts move closer to commercialization with a bespoke product in late 2021.
Turning to company-adjusted operating cash flow.
In the first quarter, we generated $1.9 billion with the majority coming from the Automotive segment.
As mentioned, cash and liquidity balances at quarter end were well above our target levels.
Now speaking of liquidity, earlier this week we extended our $13.4 billion corporate revolver and we also closed on a new $3.5 billion supplemental credit facility, further strengthening our liquidity and providing additional financial flexibility.
Unlike our corporate revolver, the supplemental facility is intended to be utilized and includes the $2 billion revolver and a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan.
We expect to fully draw the term loan over the course of 2019.
However, the impact of any draws will be leverage-neutral after taking into consideration debt reduction actions we took late last year, including a repayment of about $1 billion of higher cost affiliate debt.
Now turning now to special items in the quarter.
This represented an EBIT loss of nearly $600 million with negative cash effects of about $100 million.
The vast majority of the charges in the quarter were associated with the redesigns of Europe and South America.
As you'll recall, last year, we identified about $11 billion in potential EBIT charges for our global redesign actions with negative cash effects of about $7 billion, all through our plan period but primarily through 2021.
This year we expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of the EBIT charges with negative cash effects of about $2.5 billion.
We expect almost all of the EBIT charges to be treated as special items.
Relative to our other costs and capital for the year, we continue to expect CapEx to be similar to last year.
Pension contributions to be about $650 million, and shareholder distributions to be about $2.6 billion.
Now before I turn it over for Q&A just a few summary comments.
Our first -- our view of the quarter is that it's a really good start to the year for the company.
And while we expect our first quarter EBIT to be the strongest quarter of the year, that's due to seasonal factors and major product launches ahead, it does clearly put us on track to deliver better company results for the full year 2019.
Due to our intense focus on improving fitness across the company, the work on our product portfolio, the redesigns of our business, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, the business is now turning in a positive direction even as we continue to invest in future opportunities.
We clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, but we have a solid plan and we're demonstrating the ability to effectively execute a heavy work statement, while concurrently delivering stronger business results.
Our opportunity and our firm intention in the months and quarters ahead is to build on the momentum we're generating and ultimately deliver returns that are among the best in our business on a sustainable basis.
Operator, we'd like to now turn it over to Q&A.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.
"
2469,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Thank you.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
"
2470,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
I guess the way I would describe it is, first of all, quarters are unpredictable to some extent.
But I actually -- as I look ahead based on what we see now for North America, I think every quarter should be a pretty good quarter.
There will be plus or minus where we are this quarter, but I think every quarter looks good, strong.
They are benefiting or being hit by the things I touched on earlier.
But, in general, I think strong performance by North America throughout the year.
It will be feature costs that are relatively flat, in fact flat if you exclude the impact of the pension and OPEB that I referenced earlier.
The volume probably is not going to be as great, so that will be a headwind in part that's at best (ph) the industry that's coming through.
But in addition what you'll see that will drive the business will be favorable mix and you'll have very strong pricing throughout the year and against that flat cost it really just kind of flows right through to the bottom line.
I would refresh everyone's memory.
I think we talked about this at Deutsche Bank.
There is a new contract this year.
So with UAW -- so in the fourth quarter in general there's a large charge that we usually pick up once the ratification is achieved and that's probably to the tune of about $0.5 billion or so.
And I mentioned that back in January.
So that would be something that would be unique and one-time in the calendarization of the results in North America this year.
"
2471,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, the net engineering actually is still going to be a substantial drag on the business in an absolute sense, but it will be less so than what it was in 2018.
Obviously, part of that very much dependent on the volume, because that is what drives the royalties.
And you asked me about the central admin costs, is that what you're asking me?
"
2472,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah, we would expect to see improvement there, probably more second half-weighted than first half as Anning is working through the redesign of his organization.
But, yes, there will be an improvement in that that will contribute toward the year-over-year lessening of the loss this year.
"
2473,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"I would say, first -- I think, we've seen some improvement in the quarter, there's no question about that, but I think there's more opportunity ahead.
"
2474,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"As you know, between now and 2025 or compared to 2021, the CO2 targets for our passenger cars and commercial cars are a bit different.
And so, I think by 2030, the current regulation is about a 30% improvement in -- or reduction in CO2 for LCV and more for passenger cars.
In the short term, obviously, we had the 6.2 emissions last year in the second half, which Ford really weathered very well.
And between now and 2021 , there's another new set of requirements, which we are in a good position for, because of our new lineup.
But the requirements in Europe really start to ramp up between 2021 and 2030 with the new regulations from the EU.
"
2475,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,8,
2476,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
Thanks, John.
Obviously that would have to come from the rating agencies.
But we talk with them a lot.
We believe that we understand very clearly the areas of improvement they're looking for and it is on the operating side of the business.
As I said numerous times, it is not the balance sheet, it's not distribution (technical difficulty), it's on the operating side.
So I believe that while this is just a quarter, the fact that we saw the improvement in North America, we saw an improvement in China, although again lots of work ahead, we got to a profit which haven't been expected in Europe, because a lot of that redesign is still ahead of us in terms of the impact of that and portfolio changes as well.
I think that we are hitting the parts of the businesses that they want to see improvement in, not just a quarter we got to do this quarter in quarter out.
But I believe that's a nice step forward in terms of the things that they are concerned about.
"
2477,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Yeah.
Colin, I think the way I would describe it is while perhaps the areas where you'll be seeing impacts on the business from the actions that we take won't be new-new.
See, for example, we've talked about the redesign of Europe is under way, but we haven't given you much of the details behind that, because we're in the process of the discussion with our social partners in terms of what that actually will be.
We expect that to be completed sometimes around the middle of the year and then we'll start seeing more specifics.
So you'll get more details.
I wouldn't say that's more announcements.
It's just more details of what we've already announced.
We have talked about the fact that we're still chatting with VW and Mahindra about different opportunities.
So there again nothing new in terms of areas, but potentially more in terms of what comes out of those discussions, obviously that would be something ahead of us.
So I think it's more -- about more clarity and more details, and the way that I would further put into context what's yet to come is the commentary I provided on the special items.
We only have about $500 million in this quarter of the $600 million, which relates to business redesign.
And as I mentioned in my comments we expect to see $3 billion to $3.5 billion of charges for the full year.
So you're going to have a lot more happen in terms of actions that are then, from an accounting standpoint -- it's going to hit the books and that's going to be second, third and fourth quarter.
"
2478,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yeah.
I wouldn't necessarily assume that the announcement of the action on Sao Bernardo is the complete redesign of the region, because it's not, there's more, and we'll announce things when it's appropriate to do so.
You're not getting any effect of that action in the quarter other than the special items, because the plant is going to continue to run until toward the very end of the year.
So there's no benefit today, but we do expect to have a good benefit.
I think we've indicated a payback of about two years from that action.
So there will be more to come from the actions in South America.
The thing to note there is Argentina has really been hit hard with a very deep recession extremely high inflation, that's affecting the industry.
We're pricing this as much as we can, but we're frankly not keeping up with the inflation nor the effect on the exchange rate.
So that's sort of a unique factor in the shorter term that certainly affected the business.
Over time, our history tells us we recover those effects but in the shorter term a bit of a challenge.
The thing to me that's positive is, they basically held constant on a year-over-year basis without new product with the action in Sao Bernardo announced, with all this going on in Argentina, but they continue to find good cost performance that enabled us to keep the business where it was and so that was a win from our standpoint.
"
2479,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Let's -- Ryan, let's turn that to Jim Farley.
"
2480,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,13,"Yeah, I would -- if I could add to that, the way that I would think about the business, Ryan, is we're really focused a lot on the dealer profitability and the margins they're earning.
So we're being very thoughtful and very careful in terms of that particular part of the business.
So we're certainly not pushing and driving for the volume.
We're really kind of focused on dealer profitability and their engagement.
So that's the number one priority.
So as a result of that I wouldn't expect to see significant if any volume improvement necessarily.
This is really more of trying to get the margins back, particularly at dealer level, get the business stabilized on the locally produced front.
The thing that's interesting that you see in the bridge is the -- consolidated part of the business has turned around very, very sharply and very quickly.
And that includes the imports of the Ford brand, those products as well as Lincoln, in fact, profitable frankly in the quarter and a substantial improvement year-over-year.
So that part of the business that we control and have our arms around, we're making faster progress.
We have a lot more work and are really doing a ground-up on the JV side.
"
2481,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"Well, it did actually, because in January, I think, we indicated that we thought the results would be lower than 2019 and 2018 and today in my comments I indicated that we expect them to be about flat, so that would be around $2.6 billion.
We do not expect subsequent quarters to be at the level of performance in the first quarter.
But if you -- I mean, you've got last year's number $2.6 billion, we made $800 million.
You can do the math, it will be a very healthy second, third and fourth quarter, but it will not be based on what we see today at the level of the first quarter.
"
2482,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Yeah, that's a good question.
I mean, obviously every quarter is a bit variable, but I think the important message from today you can take from the quarter that applies to the full year particularly on structural cost is that they're not going up.
And that's probably inclusive of headwinds on a lower level of income from pension and OPEB.
As you know, that's been declining for sometime, declining again this year several hundred million dollars.
So that's inclusive of that.
And that's an important element, because when you think about the contribution costs and material costs and we're making a lot of progress there for the earlier comments from Joe there is an element of those increases that do come with the higher pricing and so forth.
So it's not just pure cost, it's costs that gives us the benefit.
So that structural cost capping if not slight reduction is going to make a huge difference in terms of our operating leverage, which is what's driving the improvement in margin.
"
2483,F,2019,1,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"Yeah.
I mean usually the first and second, not every year but the first or second quarter is usually the strongest of the year.
In this particular year, we have a lot of launches that are taking place after the first quarter.
And while coming out of the launch, that's a lot of opportunity for us.
The launch itself because of lower volume launch expenses we start to amortize the investment and so forth.
It is a bit of drag over a short period of time.
So that's ahead of us.
Also, as you know, in the third quarter, Europe shut down its plants for four weeks, so there's no production.
North America does it for one or two weeks, so you've got in general lower volume in the third quarter, because of that impact as well.
In the fourth quarter, because of the end-of-year holiday and that 10 days or whatever, we end up sort of draining the inventory that we have across the system.
And so, therefore we have more labor and overhead, but it's just an inventory for most of the year and it kind of flows out and goes into the income statement in the fourth quarter.
So that's a downward pressure there.
So those types of things.
We're still going to have good quarters coming forward.
It's just we want to signal that you shouldn't think of the first as a run rate.
It's a very good quarter.
We've done better in the first quarter before.
So now we need to restrain our enthusiasm, but we are extremely pleased with the start to the year, because it gets us off to a good start in the year that's got a lot of heavy work ahead of this, but it's a wonderful way to begin that journey.

2484,F,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Thanks, and I wanted to tackle my congratulations to Bob.
First question is just turning back to China.
I think in the past, something else you mentioned that was impacting was widening royalty, and I think that was in impact in the back half of last year and also some of the excessive structure in the Shanghai regional office.
I was wondering if you talk about how you think those two things trend as we move through 2019?
"
2485,F,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"Yeah.
"
2486,F,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,2,"But that's still to come that's not in the results we're seeing today?
"
2487,F,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,3,"Okay.
And then turning back just a question about the CO2 compliance in Europe.
I understand you're not going to sort of give us the cost but maybe you could just help us understand -- I mean, I think it's a mass-based target, so maybe where are you or what is your actual target and where is the portfolio today?
"
2488,F,2019,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,4,"Okay.
Thank you.

2490,F,2019,1,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-group-inc.,True,0,"Great.
Bob, congratulations.
First question, as I think about the cadence of your net cost savings, benefits you're achieving from Jim's fitness initiatives, should we be really circling the structural cost improvement of $309 million in the quarter and the Slide 23 walk, or is there another level or a hidden layer of cost savings that you're already seeing achieved in the P&L?
"
2491,F,2019,1,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-group-inc.,True,1,"Got it.
As a second question, curious as to what the company's plans are and what it has embedded within its long term 6% margin guidance for Europe in terms of spend to meet the CO2 emissions that are tightening?
"
2492,F,2019,1,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-group-inc.,True,2,"Okay.
But no quantification of how much you think that's going to put incremental costs in your vehicles for the region?
"
2493,F,2019,1,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-group-inc.,True,3,"Okay.
Bob, if I may, a comment on the press release attributed to you in regards to the seasonal earnings with 1Q being the strongest of the year.
Can you elaborate on that a little bit further? I think a lot of the investors will have a question on that.
"
2494,F,2019,1,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-group-inc.,True,4,"Appreciate all the colors.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations, again, Bob.

2496,F,2019,1,joseph-hinrichs,president-of-global-operations-and-automotive,False,0,"Sure.
Thanks, Jim, and thanks for the question, Adam.
I think certainly from our perspective one of the major fitness initiatives has been around capacity reduction and we're continuing to see good progress there.
And it's not just decontenting, but putting the right content in the vehicles, especially as we think about to contemplate the new vehicles that we're designing for the future.
I think what you're also seeing, of course, is the alliances and the partnerships that are taking place give us broader scale.
When we partnered with Volkswagen on van programs, we have the opportunity to get together both for engineering savings but also from a capacity utilization and supply base and ourselves, improvement there as well.
So you're seeing a number of these partnerships start to come around, which are also helpful with how we work with the supply base for scale.
I wouldn't necessarily condition it like it's an adversarial relationship, because there is an increase in technical componentry and content going into the vehicle, because of all the capabilities that Jim's been referring to in the Smart Vehicles For A Smart World, but rationalization of the powertrain portfolio is certainly a huge opportunity for all of us as we start this transition into electrification.
So those are the kind of areas I think you'll see progress, alliances, powertrain and also just leveraging the scale of the industry has to better utilize the supplier's capacity.
"
2497,F,2019,1,joseph-hinrichs,president-of-global-operations-and-automotive,False,1,"Yeah.

2499,F,2019,4,dan-levy,credit-suisse-ag,True,0,"Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the questions.
First question, your dividend is a $2.4 billion commitment annually.
Obviously, we've seen some profit compression and you do still have to fund your restructuring.
So it just means that the dividend right now is being funded by the balance sheet.
Could you just talk to the rationale of maintaining the dividend at this level? And what are the threshold and business conditions for you to maintain it?
"
2500,F,2019,4,dan-levy,credit-suisse-ag,True,1,"So I guess that the view is that the liquidity, you have plus the stream of cash flow that you do have you still feel comfortable enough with this level to maintain the dividend.
That's a fair assessment?
"
2501,F,2019,4,dan-levy,credit-suisse-ag,True,2,"Got it.
Great, thank you.
And then just as a follow-up, I think, a year ago you disclosed that your global truck, van EBIT margin was 14% in 2018.
I think actually it's maybe a little higher when you strip out the corporate costs.
So as we think about the deterioration in 2019.
And what was the likely deterioration in '20, help us maybe understand if we look back at the profit pools, would you say that the truck margin has remained intact and that it's really deterioration in other parts of the business or has that truck margin deteriorated as well?

Please turn to page 3.
At the start of this new decade, we are also at a crossroads for our industry and for Ford Motor Company.
I believe, as I've said before, there is an incredibly bright future for Ford within what has become a very disruptive environment.
And to realize this future, we undertook a fundamental redesign of the company to compete and win in this new era of smart vehicles in a smart world.
On this call a year ago, I told you that 2019 would be a year of strategic action with potential for financial improvement.
Now measured against the first part of that statement, 2019 was a year we took meaningful actions to improve our fitness and accelerate our transformation into a higher growth, higher margin business by leveraging smart connected vehicles and breakthrough customer experience.
A powerful example of our company's move into the digital future was the November reveal of our Mustang Mach-E, an exciting zero emissions vehicle that will be fully connected and continually improved through over the year updates.
We're encouraged by the interest and early orders around the world.
Moving forward, virtually all our new vehicles will be connected, enabling Ford to vastly enhance customer experience and our ability to leverage data and analytics to constantly raise quality and reduce costs.
Additionally, this past year, we forged strategic agreements and partnerships around the world, with VW, Rivian and Mahindra.
This is to help position Ford for leadership in autonomous and electric vehicles and create new business models for profitable growth in emerging and emerged markets.
We continued one of the most ambitious portfolio shifts in our history.
Focusing our capital on growing profitable segments and playing to the strength of our brand.
We are right on strategy to add compelling new products across segments, price points while phasing out unprofitable and commoditized vehicles in shrinking segments.
And this will only accelerate moving forward, which benefits our share, bottom line, and most importantly customers.
We also made significant progress on our global redesign in 2019.
We took tough but important steps to strengthen our capabilities and create a more resilient Ford.
Those actions included restructuring our operations in Europe and South America, assembling a talented new leadership team in China with strong local market expertise, and reducing the size of our salaried workforce around the world, flattening the organization and cutting down bureaucracy in the process.
In the secondary, I talked about last year potential financial improvement, we fell short of our expectations and yours in 2019.
What is particularly disappointing is that a primary reason for that shortfall was our operational execution and this is an area we are typically very effective in.
Our execution was simply not nearly good enough.
Clearly, we recognize this and of course we're accountable for it and we've taken steps to address these shortfalls.
An example of this was the manufacturing launch of our all-new Explorer.
The lost volumes in Chicago during ramp-up marred the year, and there were some important lessons that we learned.
The good news is the Explorer is a fantastic vehicle and we've entered the year with strong customer demand for it.
Financial improvement was also held back by the emergence of warranty issues primarily for vehicles designed years ago.
So before I get into the numbers, let me make this very clear.
Our leadership team is determined to return to world-class levels of operational execution.
We will do that without losing any momentum in creating a Ford Motor Company that will thrive and generate long-term value in these fast changing times.
To this end, we've made changes to our executive incentive plans, and we placed an even greater weight on free cash flow, which we think is the ultimate gauge of our success in driving growth and allocating capital to its best and highest uses.
Please turn to page 4.
Our full year revenue declined 3% and company adjusted EBIT of $6.4 billion was down 9%.
This yielded an overall margin of 4.1%, and adjusted EPS for the year was $1.19.
Importantly, we generated $2.8 billion in total company adjusted free cash flow.
Our balance sheet, it remained strong with $22 billion in cash and $35 billion in liquidity, both of which are well above our target levels.
Please turn to page 5.
As I mentioned in 2019, we significantly strengthened our portfolio around the world.
New launches included that all-new Explorer I mentioned, Escape and Super Duty and the Puma in Europe, in addition to the reveal of our Mustang Mach-E.
On a volume basis, this product renaissance will gather even more momentum in 2020 especially in North America.
Ford F-Series was America's truck leader for the 43rd consecutive year.
In the fourth quarter, F-150 volumes closed strongly with the segment share up year-over-year and sequentially.
The new Ranger in its first full year of production in the US earned a 21% share of the mid-size pickup segment in the fourth quarter.
And this contributed to our best year of total pickup sales since 2005.
So we're quite proud with the F-Series and Ranger as a one-two punch.
Ford was not only the leader in US full-size pickups, but also the leader in total pickup sales in 2019.
In Europe, we started the rollout of 17 new hybrid and all-electric passenger and commercial vehicles, including the all-new Puma SUV.
This broader electric portfolio shows how serious we are about meeting the region's new carbon footprint requirements.
We launched our first ever fully electric vehicle in China with a version of Territory, and we announced we would introduce more than 30 market specific Ford and Lincoln vehicles, 10 of these will be electrified over the next three years.
And as mentioned, our all-new Mustang Mach-E will reach customers late this year.
Now all of these product supports Ford's commitment to achieve the Paris Climate Accord Glide Path for lower CO2 emissions.
And at the same time, we maintain leadership around the globe with our franchise vehicles.
Mustang, America's and the world's number one sports coupe.
F-Series, along with Ranger, which is the number two medium-sized pickup outside the US, and number one in Europe.
Explorer, America's all time best selling SUV, and Transit the top cargo van globally.
And while some automakers are clearly pursuing full-blown mergers for scale and cost sharing, Ford's strategy is based on strategic partnerships and alliances that will deliver benefits in key segments and markets, while improving our cost and capital efficiency.
For example, our agreement with VW is structured to allow us to reap scale gains from our collective leadership position in light commercial vehicles and medium pickups, and in electrification and autonomous vehicles.
Our joint venture with Mahindra will combine low-cost engineering and manufacturing optimized for India and export to other emerged and emerging markets, with more efficient levels of investment.
With our equity position in Rivian and well matched strengths of the two companies, we can quickly bring to market an all-new BEV using Rivian's flexible platform.
In fact, last week we announced, we are working with Rivian on Lincoln's first all-electric vehicle, building on the introduction last year of the Lincoln Aviator and Corsair Grand Touring plug-in hybrids.
In terms of global redesign, Ford took decisive actions in both Europe and South America to fortify and build on strengths while addressing underperforming parts of those regional businesses.
In Europe, we announced the closure of six manufacturing facilities, which will reduce our footprint to 18 facilities from 24.
We also refocused our European product portfolio atop three pillars.
One, strengthening our leadership in commercial vehicles.
Two, delivering a targeted portfolio of passenger vehicles; and three importing iconic nameplates.
Now in the process, we're reducing our workforce in Europe by 12,000 positions with more than half of that completed in 2019.
In South America, we're moving to a lower cost asset-light business model.
And last year, we exited production of heavy trucks.
We closed our plant in San Bernardo and discontinued the Fiesta and Focus models.
Over the past three years, we've reduced our total workforce in South America by more than 40%.
In China, we completed the build-out of an experienced local leadership team and localized the first of five products, our Lincoln Corsair.
The heart of Ford's vision is preparing the company to compete and win in this emerging era, we describe as smart vehicles for a smart world.
A practical effect is we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities in mobility, connected service and autonomous vehicles, areas that will provide meaningful opportunities for growth.
For example, Ford Commercial Solutions significantly grew its data and telematics subscriptions in 2019, building out the portfolio of services.
We are leveraging those services in our large, profitable and expanding commercial truck franchises, which includes a sizable fleet market.
In terms of autonomous vehicles, we continued our credible and holistic approach to building a successful, scalable and profitable AV business, focusing on the customer experience, the self-driving system, lead operations and designing our purpose-built self-driving vehicle.
Ford AV, LLC and Argo AI now have joined autonomous vehicle testing operations in Austin, Miami, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Detroit, in the South Bay Metro area and Silicon Valley.
Now these six locations make up the largest urban AV testing footprint in the industry, providing us with a unique and invaluable diversity of real world miles driven.
With that information, we are continuously optimizing Argo's self-driving system and positioning Ford exceptionally well for commercialization and subsequent scaling of this technology.
Before I turn the call over to Tim, let me briefly touch on 2020.
As I said at the start, we begin this decade with optimism and the conviction that we're taking the right steps to redesign and restructure our business, improve our fitness and prepare the company to compete and win in the future.
2020 will be the year we reintroduce Bronco to the world, the year, we completely redesigned the F-150, the year we'll start seeing the Mustang Mach-E on roads around the world.
All these vehicles will be smarter and more connected and ever improving.
We're focused on solid execution of our product launches this year, especially where there will naturally be downtime during changeover like the F-150.
The cadence of these launches which are volume weighted toward the end of the year will drive headwinds for us in 2020, but they will strengthen our earnings and cash flow potential heading into 2021.
Now, let me briefly talk about what we are seeing and doing relative to the coronavirus.
As you would expect, our Ford team is proactively monitoring the situation on several fronts, including the safety of our employees and their families.
This is paramount, business continuity including our JV partners in China as well as customers, supply chain management, logistics and of course where we can, we want to be part of the solution.
So we are donating money and equipment where we can be most effective.
Thus my strong instinct is to want to tell you what the impact of this virus may be on our business and our guidance for this year.
However, it's simply too early.
China is only now starting to come back from an extended New Year holiday.
And many companies including Ford are currently hoping to resume large parts of their industrial operations next week.
And that is most experts are already saying and we agree that it will take weeks to begin to understand the implications of the outbreak.
In the meantime, we will describe our expectations for the business excluding the possible effects of the coronavirus.
It is possible, though, that we could absorb a modest impact from the virus within our guidance range.
For the year, we are driving for at least nominal growth in Auto as we continue our ambitious portfolio transformation.
We expect this growth though to be offset by lower EBT from Ford Credit, and a modest investment increase in mobility.
Tim Stone, our CFO will provide more color.
In fact, now I will turn the call over to Tim.
"
2505,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thanks, John.
Jim Hackett here.
I think that's well said.
I characterize it in the company that we're always managing the now and the far in parallel and they are synergistic, they feed each other.
But they have totally different kind of requirements, right? So in the now, the message in the company is we work really hard to get the portfolio rationalized, communicated, we -- just to remind you, we went to work really hard on the platform architectures underneath that whole portfolio.
At the same time, we feathered in our connectivity.
We're working on car architectures that power the vehicles.
We're talking about proportion inside of them with electrification.
So there is a lot in that -- in that product turnaround.
And the market, it's too early for me to tell you the new portfolio share improvements better than the old one.
But the market is giving us really good signs there.
It does boil down to, we can't miss a beat now in the product launches.
Today, for example, I spent a lot of time with Joe and others are working through the F-150.
So that's, that's the state and spirit in the company as we saw the mistakes, we X-rayed that deeply for you in the last call, so that you knew, we went to kind of went to the desert to get to the bottom of that.
I have zero question that we have identified what's -- what was at risk there, what bad decisions we made? What new things we have to change? That's all kind of in the rear view mirror and now it's about executing on the things that we've laid out this year.
So that's my perspective from the product.
Tim, maybe you can address the global redesign.
The thing I just want to sneak in on the global redesign.
This is -- this has to happen in parallel.
I give our people a lot of credit, because their day jobs of managing what I just laid out runs in parallel as they redesign the company and there is some really bright spots in that.
For example, the Europe team has a lot of momentum right now, and you might mention that Tim in your summary of what's been going on there.
"
2506,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Well, we would like to return value to shareholders.
I know that's a really bad answer, but it's true and the dividend has been legendary value creator at Ford.
We are really responsible about the way like you say that you think about the use of the balance sheet to fund that.
A year ago on this call, I made it clear that my objective and the way I was thinking about all the things coming in front of us is I want to continue to pay the dividend, I wanted to be able to fund the restructuring and make all the investments in the future.
You know that those -- the balance, all of those interest was behind the business plan that has rolled out.
And so I want to continue that because we said we could do it.
And right now we can.
And Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything.
"
2507,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"I am going to ask Joe to answer that, because this is a primarily North American kind of question as well.
So Joe.
"
2508,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Joe, it's an interesting thought.
I'm actually going the other way emotionally, which is I don't think the company can keep itself like of straddling in an old world and a new world forever, it kind of confuses the organization.
And so in some of the challenges that I have on mind to do this, I have a friend in the business who said, he carries around a card with what are the toughest conversations and issues that he has got to address and no one really wants to deal with.
From my perspective, the transformation has to accelerate and so I don't want to do anything that makes the organization feel like we can park it on the side.
And if it does well and grows up it gets attention, but if it doesn't, we didn't really integrate it and so I have stronger instincts the other way.
But I understand your question also in terms of, can we do something to prove that our transformation, and our strategy is actually accelerating.
And I get that, I would like to take that away is something that we, that we ought to do is try and show you how the compounding of our new ideas are actually taking off.
That's the confidence I want you have tonight is that, that I am seeing them, it's just not material enough to move the needle.
And that's what I want you to get the confidence, that is is -- it will move the needle and it will have impact.
"
2509,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Thank you.
And tonight, you know our slide started with a picture of the Mach-E.
And I was inspired by the picture as I waited for you to ask questions.
This product that's on that slide lives in great respect for the Ford legacy, but as it respects, it's not in reverence.
It's not in such reverence so that it can change.
But this vehicle is an iconic example of what we've been working on, the company has to change.
It's changing its portfolio, it's restructuring markets like Europe and South America.
Europe hadn't been touched for years.
It's taking on the bureaucracy.
We cut it by a third, $700 million likely in run rate savings.
We mandated connectivity, which was a multi-billion dollar commitment before we had the kind of software to run on this.
We build agile team, that's how this vehicle was created.
And then there is an obvious question as you look at that and I look at that is can we execute and of course, we can.
We will promise that we will earn your trust in that area.
And I don't want you to think that we have to struggle on the way to the future, we are not going to cancel the future because of the focus on earnings.
We think these -- the improvement in earnings that we all want and the requirement that we have to get to our future can live in a synergistic way and build the kind of excitement in Ford Motor Company that you heard Adam and I talking about tonight.
So thank you for your time on the call.

2513,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"So Rod, it's good to hear from you, it's Jim.
You know there is not a point tonight where we're going to go market by market.
We just don't do that for obvious competitive reasons, but let's just repeat what is in, what color is in the guidance we've given.

2514,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Thank you, Rod.
They are over-performing, which is a good thing.
That's kind of in the reviews, I've been really impressive, particularly in Europe, as we said.
Operator
All right.
Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.
"
2515,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Adam, it's good to hear from you.
And the first comment on transparency did not bounce off the atmosphere.
I do understand that in this transformation of Ford, the from-to kind of calculus isn't always apparent.
For example, consider we've got a portfolio that is in the midst of some things are sunsetting and all these new things are coming out and you, you want to know what can we project in terms of your earnings performance.
And it's my instincts that back when we first started talking together that this is going to make a much better Ford and in fact, I mean now, I am now more certain of that.
What I didn't count on and we're going to address of course is that we can't fumble execution because we, the value of Explorer launch back in our year is a different kind of story about Ford.
So that's just to confirm that we are doing our best to try and teach you about where we are in the transformation.
But it's my confidence that you're going to be happy with that.
Now the thing about Tesla is CEOs don't ever talk from this table about competitors.
But I have been really candid in the company since I came about what is the business model that's there and what frankly about is attractive? And what you can see in Ford's commitment.
I'm really proud of the team here as we arrived in June '17, the propulsion strategy was kind of nil and we got that squared away.
We have 17 new hybrid and all-electric models across the entire lineup.
So picture that Ford's in a position where it's got a portfolio of products for its customers, including a bigger extensive offering than the other guy.
But the key component of this is the need to have these vehicles connected and over the air communications and the kind of configuration that one can bring to the customers.
We already know that the kind of volume we're going to have in car years usage by 2025 will be over 100 million car years of usage of data, so just let that sink in.
And that's what, that's what the market sees right, in the future of the car industry, that there is this kind of opportunity for expansion and growth.
But I haven't forecasted that in tonight's discussion.
It's not, it's because we got to prove that we can get this done, and get it, get it to produce the kind of results that you're seeing there.
But I think we're much further along in that journey than we were just two years ago when you and I first started talking about it.
How do I know that this Mach-E has generated more attention and kind of interest than in recent memory of any kind of product.
The kind of searching that's going on about Bronco would amaze you.
And so I know that it is really high, given the execution and the kind of improvements that I just mentioned.
So let me, let you react to that.
"
2516,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Yeah.
Well, thank you for ordering the Mach-E.
I got to tease you, I just ordered mine last week.
I want the world to know I waited.
I want to get in the middle of it.
I didn't want to be first in line and went really well and they said that I'm right behind Adam Jonas...
"
2517,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"No, no, that's not the deal, I want to live it.
But thank you.
VW, so yeah I'm proud of in the repetition of the good things that happened last year, how well that came together in kind of an early phasing of what you are now witnessing and the commentary that we made in the opening was that, you don't have to combine Human Resource departments to get the kind of value in the automotive industry that we think we can, we can get arrangements like that.
So I want you to see the optimism that and hear the optimism in my voice that we're open to lots of ideas there.
And I want to also stress that Mahindra similarly is proving to us that in emerging in emerged markets, it really is expanding the power of Ford.
So right now the plate is full though with the things that we've committed to each other.
Those two companies and Ford, we really got a lot going on, and I want to see the conclusion of that before I start adding a lot more to the plate.
"
2518,F,2019,4,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Thank you, Adam.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
"
2519,F,2019,4,rod-lache,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,0,"Great, thanks for taking my question.
I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit more color on your regional auto EBIT expectations for 2020.
It seems like you would have a few pretty significant tailwinds set up, which don't really appear to be flowing into your 2020 EBIT guidance for Auto, which you said was up normally -- nominally.
I guess, essentially, I'm hoping that you can talk a little bit about the direction that you are expecting for each of the key markets.
So, like North America obviously, non-recur of the Explorer launch issues and UAW bonus, which are collectively pretty big, is that offset by the -- completely offset by the F-Series launch and other items?
And in Europe, I think Joe Hinrichs, you said that most of the 12,000 people that you had commented on leaving were still on the payroll through the end of last year and would have a bigger impact this year.
Are those just swamped by the CO2 compliance costs?
"
2520,F,2019,4,rod-lache,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,1,"Yeah, thanks for that.
Did you just say that the mobility investments would be up $0.5 billion in 2020 --
"
2521,F,2019,4,rod-lache,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,2,"Yeah.
Look, I'm sure you -- I mean there are reasons to not provide color on the regional numbers.
But from an external standpoint, you start adding up maybe a $1 billion tailwind from explorer and $600 million from UAW and certainly more than $1 billion from this head count in Europe and big plant closure in South America, it's -- those -- not quantifying that is, it makes it very challenging for us to really assess what you're, what you're facing and what's in there.
Do you have an assumption in there for a further increase in warranty costs this year?
"
2522,F,2019,4,rod-lache,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,3,"Okay.
And maybe just lastly, you talked about that $7 billion of cash spending on restructuring, the number has been quite low.
I think lower than you had originally anticipated in 2019, and it's only up a bit in 2020.
Presumably some of the cost savings are kind of tied to the cash restructuring rather than the headline GAAP charges.
Could you just give us some color on what's going on there and changing the timing? And whether we should be reading into the trajectory of the turnaround plan based on that?
"
2523,F,2019,4,rod-lache,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,4,"Just to clarify, Tim, are you suggesting that the number or the cash number may be lower than the $7 billion, or that it would just be more spread out?
"
2524,F,2019,4,rod-lache,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,5,"Okay, all right, thank you.
"
2525,F,2019,4,rod-lache,"wolfe-research,-llc",True,6,
2526,F,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks.
Good evening, everyone.
I'll first echo Rod's comments and about transparency because they really, it really would be helpful.
And we understand that you won't be, you can't know with 100% certainty these items and, but we are certainly used to management teams, given their best guess, particularly at a time when there is so much pressure, and when the stakes are so high.
So just to say, good on Rod for zoning in on that.
First question for me is Tesla, stocks worth.
It's kind of historic day as Tesla is now worth over 5 times the market cap of Ford.
Jim or Tim or Joe, can you guys understand, can you, are you sympathetic to why that is that state of the world, does it make sense to you.
What's the message the market is sending Ford Motor Company?
"
2527,F,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Thank you.
No, that's fine, Jim and I think it's -- I appreciate the thoughts and I can't wait to get my Mach-E and my kids really can't wait to see the Mach-E in the garage.
One follow-up for me, Jim regarding Volkswagen.
Is there any limit to the level of collaboration that you can conceive between you and VW.
I'm just I'm wondering if there's anything that's theoretically off limits between the two houses during a really historic kind of tectonic time for the industry where it seems like global major OEMs are forming super groups.
I'm just wondering, if there is anything off limits here.
Thanks.
"
2528,F,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"I'm probably high on the list than you, but I reckon you will still get it before me.
But --
"
2529,F,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,"Thanks, Jim.
"
2530,F,2019,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,4,
2531,F,2019,4,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,0,"Yeah, John, good evening.
So we do expect to be able to achieve the new CO2 requirements without incurring fines or purchasing credits.
I just want to make that clear.
It's a product-driven plan.
We've known about these regulations for several years.
They were first public back in 2012, 2013.
We've been playing the business accordingly.
Since then, by the end of 2020, we will have 14 new electrified offerings in the market in Europe.
And by the end of '24, we expect to have 17 electrified vehicles including number of mild hybrids, plug-in hybrids, some full hybrids and then a call -- including our electric models.
So this also includes improvements in our diesel offerings and other products that are internal combustion engines as well.
So we feel really good about the plan, we need to execute the launches on time to make sure that we get the products that we're planning to meet those, but our plan is definitely product-driven and we do not expect to incur any fines, have to pool with anybody else or purchase credits.
Thanks.
"
2532,F,2019,4,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,1,"Great.
I'll take that, Jim, thanks.
So as we said, at least nominal growth in Auto.
Jim just said, we are not going to spread that around by region.
With Ford Credit being lower, you may have heard in the call, we expect the auction values to be down 5% year-over-year -- compared with 2%, sorry in 2019, big driver there, and then increasing investments mobility.
As we saw in 2019, $0.5 billion increase for example in mobility investment.
So that's the primary color we are providing on the different segments as opposed to the regions.
We also, I can go through the headwinds and tailwinds for you, but they're not to be underestimated that the headwinds, for example, of 2020 launches late in the year F-150 for example, CO2 costs, mobility as I just mentioned, Ford Credit as I just mentioned and then tax rate up to mid to high teens compared to 11% in 2019.
Those are the primary headwinds.
Tailwinds, we certainly have a full year benefit of the sale of the Explorer, for example, as well as mix and price of new products, and then as I mentioned in the earlier question, the benefits of fitness and the global redesign and of course the non-recurrence of UAW, it's about a $0.6 billion impact.
"
2533,F,2019,4,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,2,"No, I was -- thanks for asking.
I was saying they were up in 2019 by $0.5 billion, and 2020 they will be up, we are not giving the magnitude.
"
2534,F,2019,4,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,3,"So, Joe.
Thanks, Jim.
Thanks, Dan.
I mean, first off, we're very pleased with where we are with our F-Series and Ranger here in North America and the range of performance in places like Europe and other places around the world.
Without getting into specifics of the margins in 2019, we're -- I also will say that our pricing, transaction prices, incentive levels relative to the competition, and our overall sales volume were all very good in 2019 here in the US and so we feel very pleased with our progress going into a year when we have a new F-150.
We had a new Super Duty at the end of last year.
So we're not worried at all about where our competitive position is on our F-Series trucks.
In fact, we're really excited about the new trucks that we have coming this year.
And if you know that the cycle times of where things are, we get the benefit of a new truck after seeing what GM and Ram have done and actually held on very strongly to our volume and our pricing.
If you look at the pricing specifically, we continue to have the highest transaction prices in the segment with the oldest truck on F-series, F-150 specifically and adding Ranger to the portfolio just added to the business, and in fact gave us the largest pickup volume in the US last year of all manufacturers combined, so -- or all manufacturers that we compete with.
So we feel really good about where we are on the F-Series.
As Jim mentioned, we feel really good about where we are right at this point in time and the launch was coming up in the second half of the year on F-150.
So we're not -- F-150 and F-Series is of course the crown jewels of our company and we feel really good about where they are competitively and where they are from a profit standpoint.
"
2535,F,2019,4,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,4,
2536,F,2019,4,john-murphy,bofa-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening guys.
A first question.
As we look at what you're working on right now, there is kind of two layers of rationalization, sort of, there is this near-term operational execution turnarounds that needs to occur and then there's the global redesign.
And as we look at this, I mean you're staring down the barrel of great product launches or great products and you got to get those launches right, and products that have just launched.
So, I mean in the near term, it just seems like you've got the product, the operational execution is just a real issue.
I'm just curious, I mean we can all see that you're kind of identifying it but what really turns that around.
And it's not -- the products there, just trying to understand what really gets this operational execution turned in the near term hopefully.
And then sort of as you look at the inflection point on the global redesign, is that the kind of thing that's going to hit in late 2020 or early 2021 because what you're indicating as far as the charges, looks like you'll be halfway through.
So it's just, it seems like that inflection point is not going to come until 2021.
It might still be a headwind in the near term.
So in those two layers if you can kind of talk about the actions you're taking near term and the inflection point on the global redesign.
"
2537,F,2019,4,john-murphy,bofa-merrill-lynch,True,1,"Okay, that's helpful.
And then just a second question, just quickly on Europe and with the CO2 regs tightening this year, next year and going forward.
I'm just curious, if you think with your current product portfolio and what you have in the works with the VW alliance that you'll be able to meet the requirements over there, or will you have to do some kind of pooling or pay fines over the next one to two years? And I mean do you think this is something you can solve in-house with product solution or you going to have to go out-house and you're pooling or pay fines?
"
2538,F,2019,4,john-murphy,bofa-merrill-lynch,True,2,"Great.
And then just one just quick question on slide 14, Tim.
This $500 million of negative cost, I mean that has the $600 million of the UAW cost and it's -- so on a like-for-like basis, costs actually improved in the quarter.
Would that be a fair way to read that?
"
2539,F,2019,4,john-murphy,bofa-merrill-lynch,True,3,"Slide 14 you have cost was a negative $0.5 billion.
But I would imagine that's got the UAW contract of $600 million.
"
2540,F,2019,4,john-murphy,bofa-merrill-lynch,True,4,"Got it.
Okay, all right, great, thank you very much.

Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer.
Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Businesses, Technology & Strategy; and Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our results, progress against our strategic initiatives and guidance for 2020.
Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and guidance, after which, we'll turn to Q&A.
Following the Q&A, Jim Hackett will make closing remarks.
Our comments today will include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's call will include forward-looking statements about our business.
Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors for -- that are included on page 26 of our presentation.
Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.
References to company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted.
As a reminder, starting in 2020, we changed our business units in our Auto segment to align with how we now manage our business.
To help you navigate this in the appendix of our earnings deck is a diagram of the changes, including where results from certain joint ventures will be reported.
We've also included 2018 and 2019 results by quarter that coincide with the new reporting structure.
The minor IR housekeeping.
Going forward, we will announce the date for our next earnings release in conjunction with results for the previous quarter.
For example, we are announcing today that the date for our 2020 Q1 earnings will be April 28.
Please disregard our previously announced dates for July and October 2020.
Now I will turn the call over to Jim.

2544,F,2019,4,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Thank you.
The first question is, maybe just a clarification, Tim, you mentioned mobility investment up modestly, is that apples-to-apples, because aren't you de-consolidating Argo in 2020? So shouldn't that help with your share of the loss being lower?
"
2545,F,2019,4,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"Okay.
But just to clarify then, the -- should we expect to see the mobility loss higher in '20 even with the de-consolidation.
"
2546,F,2019,4,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,2,"Okay and then just maybe a follow on to Adam's question earlier.
And I guess, in the spirit of disrupting yourself from within Jim.
I think it's something you mentioned to me once, now that you have some units coming through in '20 and '21, is there any thought to actually just taking and separating out all the electric assets, the Mach-E, the MEB and Rivian derivatives and break that out as like a Ford E similar to what you've done in mobility to sort of help show us that transition?
"
2547,F,2019,4,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,3,"Okay.
And maybe if I could just squeeze one more in.
The $7 billion cash restructuring, you've only spent a little bit, it looks like you've spent a little bit over $2 billion through 2020.
I understand that sort of comes when you could sort of make announcements, but should we think that that remaining just under $5 billion will be done by '21 or is that also pushed out versus prior thinking?
"
2548,F,2019,4,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,4,"Okay, thank you.
Operator
And that's all the time we have for questions.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Hackett.

"
2550,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Jim.
While our 2019 results were not OK, I'm confident we have abundant opportunities to improve our operational execution, drive growth, strengthen our financial results, including cash flow and in the process, earn the confidence of our stakeholders.
We will achieve our potential and optimize long-term value through timely decisive actions to strengthen our business and execute on our long-term vision.
These include applying sharp rigor to the allocation of capital to higher return investments, including our franchise products.
As you heard me say in the past, we're focused on consistently improving customer experience and operational execution across our business.
We're achieving important progress on our global redesign making tough choices to lay the foundation for improvement in future growth, free cash flow, profitability and returns on capital.
We're driving fitness, for example scaling or improving the operating leverage of our structural costs and capital efficiency and forming alliances and joint ventures that will enable us to drive durable scale benefits.
We're prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable, long-term growth in mobility and we will continue to employ disciplined execution to drive strong results from Ford Credit.
Turning to our full year operating performance in 2019.
Full year adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion was flat year-over-year as continued improvement in working capital in our Auto business, lower capital spending and higher distributions from Ford Credit were largely offset by the UAW contract related bonuses of about $600 million.
Free cash flow is our most important financial measure and we're committed to generating sustainable growth over time.
Our cash and liquidity are $22 billion and $35 billion respectively, above our target levels.
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings.
Revenue declined 3% for the year, or 1% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
And adjusted company EBIT of $6.4 billion was down 9%.
While full-year Auto EBIT declined, the benefits of our redesign, fitness initiatives and stronger product portfolio driven by our decision to reallocate capital to higher return products were evident in our underlying results.
Led by North America, Auto delivered $2.4 billion in favorable market factors, another strong year for us.
This is supported by improved mix and pricing across most regions.
Auto structural costs, excluding pension and OPEB were down for the year, primarily as a result of improved fitness and global redesign actions.
The decline in structural cost was a sharp contrast to before we embarked on fitness when those costs were increasing an average of nearly $2 billion a year.
Within Auto these favorable trends were more than offset by lower volumes, including the temporary effects of new product launches and the discontinuation of sedans in North America and low-margin products in other regions.
Higher net product costs as we continue to invest in the transformation of our product portfolio, unfavorable currency effects, UAW contract ratification costs, and higher warranty expenses.
Regionally, we cut our loss in China by one-half year-over-year, and Europe is just shy of breakeven.
Together these regions accounted for $1.1 billion in EBIT improvement.
Outside of Auto, we increased our investment in mobility by more than 75% or $0.5 billion as we continued to expand our capabilities, and prepare for the launch of our AV business.
Ford Credit had exceptional results, its best in nine years, delivering $3 billion in EBT.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated $0.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow, down year-over-year primarily due to UAW contract related bonuses.
Wholesales, which were off 8% in the quarter contributed to a 5% decline in revenue.
These drops were driven by lower volumes in all regions, including the temporary effects of product launches and the discontinuation of sedans in North America and low-margin products in other regions.
Auto EBIT of $0.2 billion was down $0.9 billion as higher net pricing and mix, led by North America were more than offset by lower volumes, UAW contract related costs, higher net product costs related to new products and adverse currency exchange.
Our strategic investments in mobility increased more than 75% or $0.1 billion, largely driven by higher investments in autonomous vehicles.
Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with $0.6 billion in earnings before taxes, down 5%.
The decline was driven by lower receivables, partially offset by favorable residual and credit loss performance.
Loss metrics continue to reflect healthy and stable consumer credit and auction values for off-lease vehicles were down 4% for the quarter and 2% for the year.
For 2020, we expect auction values to be down about 5%.
Company adjusted EBIT declined by $1 billion to $0.5 billion and our adjusted EBIT margin was down 227 basis points to 1.2% as improvement in China and Europe was more than offset by decline in North America.
Looking at our largest regions in more detail.
North America wholesale units were down 8% in the quarter.
This is driven by a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 when we were at peak volumes with no major product launches, as well as by the launches of Super Duty and Escape and the planned discontinuation of sedans.
The 2% decline in revenue was less than the decline in wholesales as improved mix and higher net pricing partially offset the decline in volume.
EBIT was down 64%, and margin declined 480 basis points, largely as a result of UAW contract related bonuses and lower volumes.
In Europe, where we are carrying out a dramatic redesign of our business, wholesale declined 4% due to the planned discontinuation of low-margin products.
Revenue in Europe was down 4% or 1% excluding the impact of exchange.
The decline in revenue, excluding exchange was less than the decline in wholesales as improved product mix driven by our portfolio actions largely offset volume effects.
Decline in Europe's top line metrics is an outcome of our redesign and portfolio shift as we exit low-margin businesses and refocus our portfolio on higher growth and higher return opportunities.
The benefit of this refocus is evident in a few areas, for example, profitability.
In the fourth quarter, EBIT in Europe improved from a loss of $199 million to a profit of $21 million.
This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profitability improvement in the region.
This progress includes stronger product mix and lower structural costs.
Our redesign and portfolio shift in Europe also make us better prepared to deliver on the region's new CO2 requirements.
Compliance with these new regulations has been built into our product cycle and business plans for several years, and we expect to achieve the new CO2 requirements without incurring fines or purchasing credits.
In China, wholesales which include JV volumes were down 7%.
This is the third consecutive quarter of moderating declines in volume.
Consolidated revenue in China was down 38%, mainly because of lower volumes and component sales to joint ventures in the country.
Our EBIT loss in China narrowed $200 million, an improvement of $300 million year-over-year, driven by decline in structural costs and improved joint venture results.
This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in results in China.
For all of 2019, we were able to cut our losses by one-half as new products supported improved market factors including mix and net pricing.
Lower tariffs and favorable exchange improved contribution margin, and our focus on overhead drove a significant decline in structural costs.
We continue to emphasize dealer engagement and profitability along with inventory discipline, but keeping production aligned to demand.
We've also made progress shifting our portfolio from imports to locally manufactured.
In 2019, we launched Lincoln Corsair and expect to localize four additional vehicles in the future.
In the fourth quarter, we recorded $2.7 billion in special item charges with cash effects of about $200 million.
Actions related to our global redesign accounted for $0.4 billion in special item charges and all the negative cash effects.
The balance of special item charges included $2.2 billion for a previously announced remeasurement loss related to our global pension and OPEB plans.
In July, 2018, we announced plans for a global redesign, which included a potential $11 billion of EBIT charges and $7 billion of related cash effects to fund the rationalization of our cost structure, portfolio and footprint.
Those changes were to ensure that Ford in each of our regional auto businesses drive sustainable, profitable growth.
Since announcing that plan, we've incurred $3.7 billion of EBIT charges, and $1.1 billion of related cash effects with the majority of them in 2019.
Now I'll expand on our perspective on 2020.
At a macro level, our guidance reflects our expectation for continued GDP growth globally and across our major markets.
We also anticipate healthy industry volumes on an absolute basis, but down modestly from 2019, including declines in the US, Europe and China.
This outlook does not factor in any assumptions for impacts from the coronavirus to our global business, as it is still a very fluid situation, and we're still assessing the magnitude and duration of potential impacts.
For Ford, 2020 will be another heavy product launch year, as we continue to shift investments to our franchise strengths.
For example, in 2020, 75% of North America's volume will be all-new or refreshed versus 2017.
This is up from 40% in 2019, an increase of 35 points.
Another way to slice this is by looking at the average ages of our vehicles in our portfolio.
In the US, the average age will drop from 5.3 years in 2017 to 3.3 years in 2020, on our way to 2.9 years by 2023.
After that, we plan to keep a stable and competitive product plan with fresh products every year.
So looking at 2020 more closely, our launches include our new F-150, a new-to-the-lineup small off-road utility vehicle and Mustang Mach-E.
We'll also launch our strongest lineup yet of electrified vehicles including HEV and PHEV versions of popular nameplates like Corsair, Kuga and F-150.
At the same time, we'll ramp products introduced in 2019 like Explorer, Aviator, Kuga Escape, Puma Transit 2-Ton and Super Duty.
In addition, late in the year, we will start production of our highly anticipated all new Bronco, with availability for customers in early 2021.
As you consider our guidance, you should be mindful of several tailwinds and headwinds.
For tailwinds, we expect full-year of sales of all new Explorer and improved product mix and pricing from other new products.
Additional fitness and benefits from our global redesign and the non-repeat of the UAW bonuses.
For headwinds, we expect the back-end loaded nature of our launch cadence, especially F-150, the cost of CO2 compliance, increased investments in mobility, lower EBT from Ford Credit largely driven by our assumptions for residual values, and the non-repeat of mark-to-market gains on derivatives, and a higher effective tax rate.
All of these considerations contribute to our 2020 guidance for $2.4 billion to $3.4 billion and adjusted free cash flow.
For adjusted EBIT, we're targeting a range of $5.6 billion to $6.6 billion which assumes at least nominal growth in Auto offset by lower EBT from Ford Credit and a modest investment increase in mobility.
With an effective tax rate in the mid to high teens, our adjusted EPS range is $0.94 to $1.20 per share.
In the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBIT to be down more than $1.1 billion from the first quarter 2019, driven by the continuation of higher warranty costs we experienced in the second half of 2019, lower volume, lower results from Ford Credit and higher investment for mobility.
And we expect our effective tax rate in the quarter to be at the high end of our full year guidance range.
Relative to calls on capital for the year, we expect capex to be $6.8 billion to $7.3 billion, as much as $800 million lower than in 2019, reflecting benefits from our fitness initiatives.
Funded pension contributions of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion and regular quarterly dividends of $0.15 per share as always subject to Board approval each quarter.
For global redesign, we expect to incur $0.9 billion to $1.4 billion of EBIT special item charges with negative cash effects of $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion.
Our guidance assumes no material change in the current economic environment including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs.
As a reminder, our guidance does not factor in assumptions for impact from the coronavirus as it is still a fluid situation.
Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those detailed in our filings with the SEC.
We have a strong bias for action to improve our operating performance, to protect our investment grade rating and ensure a strong balance sheet.
Specifically, our commitment to have entering recession, a cash balance of $20 billion and liquidity at $30 billion, to preserve our debt capacity and to sustain the fully funded and derisk status of our funded pension plans.
All of our capital allocation decisions are made with these priorities front of mind, including funding our traditional products, and non-product investment plans.
Our growth plans for electrification, mobility, connected services and autonomy and our regular dividend.
Before we move to Q&A, there are few things I encourage you to keep in mind as you think about Ford, today and for the long term.
First, our customers are informing and driving everything we do.
That is why 2019 was and 2020 will be such robust product launch years for us.
We are bolstering our winning portfolio of vehicles based on what our customers want and need, reallocating capital to those higher return growth opportunities and carrying out changeovers of our highest volume and most profitable vehicles.
Second, we are determined to always get better to persistently improve our fitness and our operating execution.
We have abundant opportunities across our business to drive free cash flow, along with long-term growth in revenue and profitability, including adjusted EBIT margins of 8% or better.
We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and holding investment grade credit ratings.
And third, as I look ahead, I'm optimistic.
We have many opportunities to improve our operational execution, drive growth, strengthen our financial results including cash flow, in the process earn the confidence of our stakeholders.
Now, let's open the call for questions.
Operator.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
"
2551,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah, so from a redesign standpoint, we made, as Jim said, strong progress in 2019.
And it's a highlight for the year.
Europe, for example is carrying out strong execution of the redesign of its business, announced closure of six manufacturing facilities, eliminated a total of 12,000 positions, and focused on leadership and doubling down on that leadership in commercial vehicles and importing iconic nameplates as well as passenger vehicles.
South America continued to move to lower cost asset-light footprint, including exiting the production of heavy trucks in San Bernardo as you know and discontinued Fiesta and Focus models.
And for the year, we saw charges this year of $3.2 billion and total thus far of $3.7 billion.
If you factor in the guidance we're giving on restructuring charges to be at $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion through the end of '20 and from a cash standpoint through the end of '21, $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion.
And I think the benefits of the redesign as well as the fitness are starting to show through.
If you look at 2018, for example, structural costs were flat.
2019, structural costs were down year-over-year.
So you're starting to see it reflected in the underlying fundamentals of our results.
And as you suggested they continue to build over time as further actions are implemented.
"
2552,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Correct.
"
2553,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
As far as the time frame on that as you said, $1.9 million to $2.4 billion through the end of '20, of the $7 billion and beyond that, we haven't given specific timelines or calendarization over the next several years.
We'll update everyone as we have more information.
"
2554,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,4,
2555,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Slide 15, you said?
"
2556,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"So, yeah.
On slide 14 in North America, UAW is included in other.
"
2557,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah, it will potentially only add to your comment you just made, but I think we took a step forward this quarter in providing a segment level commentary connected with the cash flow and EBIT guidance that we gave, in addition to not providing regional commentary.
We're not speaking to specific attributes from a cost standpoint, such as warranty and so forth.
"
2558,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yeah, I think slide 20 illustrates the $11 billion in charges and $7 billion and how we're progressing against that $3.7 billion thus far, as I mentioned we factored in the guidance for 2020 would be $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion, potential actions that we are still considering there.
Dor cash standpoint, $1.1 billion thus far and with the guidance we gave $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion.
As far as the calendarization of that, we still have several years to continue to execute.
I mean on the global redesign, we don't have a new announcement to make today.
But I think one of the things we are seeing in the cash savings, cash side, sorry the saving, the team has been especially thoughtful about how we execute on the restructuring actions in Europe and in South America, for example, and taking every opportunity to save cash in the process.
"
2559,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"I was addressing the next question about -- apologies.
I was addressing the question as to why we made them lower that you might have been expecting through 2020.
The number is still $11 billion and $7 billion over --
"
2560,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"No, that's well said.
And that's one of the reasons why we look at our targeted cash and liquidity positions, we established those targets of $20 billion and $30 billion, which were $22 billion and $35 billion now, heading into a downturn.
So it could be in a position to invest in our long-term investment, the customer experience and fund the dividend for shareholders.
"
2561,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"That's right.
That's why we gave the guidance for the $0.15 per share dividend, throughout this year per quarter.
"
2562,F,2019,4,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Yes.
So again in 2019, mobility investment was up $0.5 billion and explaining our range of EBIT guidance for 2020, along with -- at least normal growth in Auto and Credit being lower, now we are saying mobility investments to be up again year-over-year, we are not quantifying the amount.
We will be de-consolidating Argo when that transaction closes.
As a reminder, that's the self-driving system only, the SDS.
The go-to market and other aspects of that as far as vehicle customer value proposition is separate level of investment.
We're taking a very prudent approach to it.
"
2563,F,2019,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
"
2564,F,2019,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"Thanks for taking my question.
I had a couple.
Just on Q4, to follow on John's question, North America, that's been quite a bit lower than expected in the quarter.
I was wondering, is there an unusual warranty catch-up impact in there? How should we be thinking about warranty, which is up a lot over the past two years? Anything in there that shouldn't recur next year?
And then also on pricing, I'm still puzzled by what changed relative to incentives.
Just thinking about the market, one of the biggest changes that's happened since your last call is that GM has had a strike, and their in-transit pipeline is basically emptied out.
So, if anything, with your biggest competitor declining to maybe 50 days of inventory, I would think that the pricing environment gets better from here.
It sounds like you disagree.
I was hoping you can elaborate.
"
2565,F,2019,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"Could you just clarify what the charge is for pre-existing warranty that you're rolling through the numbers this year? And then just my last question is, what signs should we be taking away, looking at the international numbers, and kind of thinking forward.
Obviously, there are savings here in Europe, China and South America, but the volumes are down as well in those markets.
As you sort of look at what's happening here, any color on how we should be thinking about the trajectory of improvement from here as we think about next year, the positives on costs, maybe higher compliance, cost issues, that kind of thing?
"
2566,F,2019,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,3,"Okay.
Thank you.
"
2567,F,2019,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,4,
2568,F,2019,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks, everybody.
Hey, Jim, how are you?
"
2569,F,2019,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Good.
Just two quick questions, and apologies for the background noise.
I just wanted to zone in on the consolidated China business, which my understanding is imported products, it is, I know, very Lincoln heavy from the US into China, calculating an operating margin loss of around negative 25%, negative 30%, that territory.
Can you just again justify or explain why would you do that? It doesn't strike me as a business worth doing.
Do you have a choice to just stop doing that? Just to stop selling US-made cars into China? Which, for a variety of reasons, as a global automaker, you think you've got to make where you sell.
Is that something you can stop doing, or is there a story of, you're trying to keep the blood in the patient, the dealer lifeline kind of going, and that can kind of-you can cycle out of that, and stop doing that stuff?
"
2570,F,2019,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"Thanks, Joe and Jim.
If I can just sneak in one more on hybrids.
There seems to be this referendum going on in global autos where some companies are kind of canceling their hybrid programs and saying very openly that they view them as regulatory cars and compliance vehicles that consumers don't really fully value, even if on paper they make sense, and they are really complicated vehicles, and there's not a lot of capital to throw around, and others are moving straight to EVs.
And then some, I'd say like you and Toyota are in a camp of, hybrids are the real deal.
They're going to be with us for a long, long time and consumers value them.
Maybe Joe, for you, if I were to ask you kind of 5, 10 years out, you're in a long-term business where product you're planning now, some of it won't even be on sale for north of five years, and it has to be on the road for 10 or 20 years.
If I put that longer-term hat on, are you equally bullish on hybrids as you are on EVs? If I force you to pick one, really that 10-plus years, where is the incremental Ford dollar going to invest?
"
2571,F,2019,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,"I can't wait.
"
2572,F,2019,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,4,"As long as the internal combustion part of the hybrid does not increase, does not offset that.
But I get your point, and I do appreciate both of you answering the question.
Thank you.

2574,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,0,"Hi, John.
Thanks for the question.
So if you look at it, the simple answer to your question is, I wouldn't say there's anything dramatically changed in the environment at an industry level.
Let me explain to you what's going on.
For example, in the third quarter, Ford's incentive increase year over year was slightly lower than what the industry average was for the US market in the third quarter.
What's happening in the second half of the year, our incentives overall are slightly higher than we'd expected versus our plan for the year.
That's largely driven by a couple of products.
If you look at the Ranger launch this year, it's gone very well, we've been gaining share every month this year, and we had 18% segment share in September.
But as you could expect, the competitors haven't let us just grow that share without any fight, so we've seen a little bit higher incentives on Ranger than we'd expected, given the launch of the vehicle this year.
Still very optimistic about the product.
It won APEAL, it won IQS for J.D.
Power, but incentive spend on that product has been a little higher than we were expecting in the second half of the year.
If you look at what happened in the summer months, our competition on F-Series was very aggressive, and so in September, we took some actions.
We saw our segment share in F-150 come back up in September, and so we had to take some actions there.
And Edge is in a very competitive segment, a little more competitive this year than we had planned for the year.
That's kind of where you look at it, but in general, that's more us versus our plan for the second half of the year, but I was referring to the US industry in the third quarter as a reference point.
Incentives are still pretty much under control and the industry is behaving in a pretty rational way so far.
"
2575,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,1,"Yeah, thanks, Jim.
Thanks, John.
So a really important launch for us, clearly.
Just to step back for a second, so far this year we launched the Ranger all new in North America, a very successful launch.
Very unusual that it wins its segment in IQS in the first year of introduction.
We just launched Escape and Corsair down at Louisville, that launch has gone very well.
We're ahead of plan, actually, on that launch.
So the Explorer Aviator launch is a very unique situation.
As Jim said, we're disappointed in our overall performance in the ramp up of the volume.
The products themselves are wonderful, the Aviator is a fabulous product.
About half the sales of Explorer so far are FT and Platinum, and if you haven't driven an FT, I really challenge you to do so.
It's a lot of fun and
"
2576,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,2,"Yeah, you're right.
But back to the launch, so Chicago is our oldest plant.
It was launched in 1924.
It's very, very constrained as far as physical location, and as far as land and the area around the plant.
Simply put, we took on too much.
We signed up for too much at launch.
We tried to launch on three crew, which we didn't even try to do when we launched the Limited F-150 back in 2014.
We launched the Aviator and Explorer both at the same time.
We had the hybrid version of the Explorer, we had the Police Interceptor, we had Black Label Aviator, we had all this content and simply put, with the new, with the product going from front-wheel drive to rear-wheel drive architecture, all new assembly lines, all-new body shop, all those things at once, we took on too much and we shouldn't have.
And so, part of the lessons learned is obviously go back to how we manage these launches and sequence to them in a way that gives the team a chance to be successful.
Our wholesales were down in the third quarter about 19,000 Explorers year over year, and we also had an additional 6,000 Aviators that weren't in the previous year.
And so we feel really good about the fourth quarter.
The last week or so, we've been running about 59 JPH, we're actually running out a parts from our suppliers as we started to ramp up.
We used to run at 60 JPH, so we're just about at where we have been historically in that plant, plus we have the show center, the new additional line coming online starting at about 6 JPH by the end of the month.
So, we actually feel really good about where we are right now, it's been a lot of work and a lot to get here.
The products look great.
We have plenty of available inventory now in the dealers, and we're excited about where they're going to go from here.
For the rest of the launches, John, the Super Duty launch looks good this year, The Transit launch looks good this year, Puma in Europe looks good.
We have a lot of work to do for next year's launches, but I feel good about where we are for the rest of the year.
"
2577,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,3,"Yeah, Rod, thanks.
If you look at it, the bulk of the warranty cost increases are in North America.
The 2018 model year and before that are the model years where we are seeing an increase in the higher time in service warranty claims than we had accrued for and had been planning for.
That's largely driven by some powertrain actions.
Some of those suppliers, some of them our own.
As Jim suggested, we've done a lot of rework on our product development process to make sure we've learned from this.
But, we have to get this bubble working through our system that we're seeing is here.
We're seeing really good progress in our 2019 model year vehicles, same point in time, including six months, nine months in service, those kind of things, so we feel really good about the progress we're making, but we have this 2018 model year and a few years before that working its way through the system.
The way our process works, of course, we accrue for forward models based on the experience we've been having, and so it takes a little while for that to work its way through the system, but that's what you're seeing.
It is largely in North America, from that perspective, and that's why you see it.
On US incentives, I just want to go back to what I was saying before.
First of all, we haven't seen a markedly different approach by any of our competitors in the marketplace recently.
We'll watch that very carefully, of course.
Our completed transaction prices are $3,000 higher than the all-new Ram and Silverado, even though our truck is a couple of years older.
But we are watching, as I said, you know, there are a couple of segments where we saw some changes in the dynamics that we didn't plan for in the second half, Ranger and Edge were two of them that I was referring to.
But I also said that we saw in the third quarter, and we've also seen in October so far, the market has been pretty disciplined, to your point, and we're watching that very carefully.
But a little bit of the -- the bulk of the guidance change is really warranty related.
I just want to be clear.
Some of these other issues are also important, but the warranty that we're seeing that we have to address from the 2018 model year and before is really the majority of what's changed in North America.
"
2578,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,4,"Yeah, on the international markets, Rod, we've seen progress obviously this year in Europe and in China.
I think the European team is really making a lot of progress on the redesign work that's been in place now for quite some time.
We feel good about the progress we're making.
South America is feeling some pressure from what's going on in Argentina, but the South America business continues to make improvements as well in their restructuring, so both Europe and South America are really well on plan, where we want them to be on the redesign efforts.
On China, our sales have not come up as fast as we were expecting them to in the second half of this year.
Part of that is industry, but part of that is our own performance.
We're really seeing the dealer network starting to really grow their sales force, their profitability is returning, and our inventory is in really good shape, so we're watching that very carefully.
I think the one to watch is with the China industry and how well do we do with our new models that we launched in the third quarter, like the Focus Active, The Edge SD and ST line, the Taurus, the Territory EV, and a number of other products coming.
We need to show growth in our China volumes.
So, the volumes are down, as you suggested.
Part of that's intentional with some of the product changes we made, choices we made in Europe to get out of some of that volume.
With the downsizing we're doing in Europe, we got out of Focus and Fiesta -- I'm sorry.
In South America, we got out of Focus and Fiesta production, that's by design.
But I think hopefully you'll see from here forward we can grow the business in China with the products we have, and you will see continued improvements in the European business.
"
2579,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,5,"Sure.
So, Joe, let me just be clear.
We shipped about, through the end of the third quarter is the data I'm referring to.
We shipped about 96,000 units.
We had about 9,500 in inventory, most of those were in Chicago.
There's a couple of thousand still in Flat Rock.
Just a reminder, there is no physical space around the Chicago assembly plants, so when we have any issue, there is no place to put the vehicles.
I mean, if you've ever been to South Side Chicago, you know there is no physical space.
But some of the reports have been overly dramatized.
We've used the Flat Rock for many launches, we did this in the past because Flat Rock right now is working on one shift.
It has plenty of capacity, it has a lot of skilled people.
It has a rail yard nearby, and when you're doing software updates or even if you're doing some physical repairs to the vehicle, or doing some inspections, having skilled people and having floor space and space in the yard to be able to do that is much more important to be able to do that with a good quality, than trying to force it, moving vehicles around because you have no physical space.
We think we'll have all the inventory cleared out by the end of November, and we feel really good about that.
We have plenty of inventory out in the field now for both Explorers and Aviators in the dealerships.
A lot of that came on pretty quickly, admittedly, in September and October.
We've been shipping what we're -- actually in the last week, we shipped a little more than we actually built, because we're actually starting to clear out some of those units.
We're shipping what we're building right now, and we feel really good about the flow of that going forward.
But, you know, we just don't talk about it, but we've leveraged Flat Rock a number of times over the last five or six years on launches.
But unfortunately, the lost production that we had and the slower ramp up than we expected in Chicago led to people wanting to report on other things as well.
Our first and foremost approach, of course, is to protect the customers and keep them well protected.
I want to be clear about one of your questions.
We don't recognize the vehicles as wholesaled in our revenue stream until they are released with good quality and saleable to the dealer and to the customer.
All those vehicles that I'm telling you that are still on hold, they are not wholesaled.
We don't wholesale until they're gate released with the quality to be able to be sold.
"
2580,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,6,"Yeah.
It's a very fair question, Adam.
I recognize our consolidated operations in China are complicated, because we have the Lincoln imported products, we have some of the Ford imported products.
We also have the cost structure of Ford-owned entities and employees in China, and then we have our allocations from the corporation and from engineering, etc., are in the consolidated numbers, so it's a compilation of a lot of things.
Suffice to say, we don't believe in exporting vehicles at a contribution margin loss, as long as we don't have a spike in import duties that are a near-term issue.
The solution to this largely is around localization plans for our business in China.
We've been very public about, we have five more vehicle being planned to be locally assembled in the near term.
That includes the Lincoln Corsair and the Ford Explorer.
A number of products are going to be localized over the next year, year-and-a-half, which will really influence this.
It will help us be more competitive cost-wise in the business in China, but also will take away some of the exposure we've had, just some of the fluctuations in tariffs.
We feel good about that plan.
As you know and you noted, the Lincoln plan has been an import plan until now, when we start localizing Lincoln Corsair and then more to come from there, which will really help with this.
They're contribution margin positive.
There's a lot of costs in the consolidated business, but this will largely get taken care of by the localization plans we have going forward.
Thanks.
"
2581,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,7,"Yeah, Adam.
Thanks.
There is a lot there.
When Jim Farley announced, I think it was now a little more than a year-and-a-half ago about $11 billion commitment to electrification, we were all in on all parts of this discussion.
Yes, we see significant growth in our hybrid business over the next five years.
And part of that is, we think that where consumers are today and where costs are today, that makes a lot of sense for the economic choice of the consumer.
As you know, we're taking a portfolio approach to this.
It isn't just about hybrids or plug-in hybrids, it also about electric vehicles starting with a very exciting vehicle next year, and the other ones are coming after that.
I think you are talking about a transition period.
We think that hybrids will continue to be part of the equation for a number of years to come, but our BEV portfolio will grow substantially over the course of time, and we think that ultimately is where this largely goes, but we do see a role for hybrids in the portfolio.
Remember, we get questions all the time about, with the movement of sedans largely out of the North American portfolio, what happens if gas prices spike? Well, again, our portfolio approach, which we've been consistent all along, our new SUVs all have some kind of electrification as part of each nameplate we're launching, so that we can offer solutions to customers, if we should see a spike in fuel prices, or other things.
So there's a number of reasons why it's important to us, but we are bullish on battery electric vehicles.
We think it will be toward the end of the decade that will be a significant portion of the portfolio of electrification.
But we do still see hybrids as being an important part of the portfolio, especially in the near term, where there is no compromise, no range anxiety for consumers.

2582,F,2019,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"president,-automotive",False,8,
2583,F,2019,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,0,"Good afternoon, guys and thanks for the call.
Just a first question on, to the rest of the year, already it's the fourth quarter.
Even when you back out the UAW bonuses, it looks like you're doing $1 billion, $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, so it seems like it's a little bit on the light side, and you very specifically highlighted higher-than-planned incentives in North America.
I'm just curious, are you see something on the competitive front, where pricing is getting much more difficult? It just kind of seems a little bit odd, after you just posted $700 million positive net price in the third quarter.
It just doesn't seem to match up with what you just did, so something changed dramatically in the competitive environment?
"
2584,F,2019,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,1,"Okay, and then just a second question, and this might be a little bit more for Joe, but Jim, I'd obviously love to hear your view on this.
There was a lot of concern around the Explorer launch, and it sounds like there was a lot of problems there, but it seems like you've got your arms around it and are ramping up pretty well.
Just curious, was that story overplayed in the press, and we all got a little bit too concerned about that? Are there any lessons that you've learned for product launches? Because obviously, you have a ton coming down the pipe in the next 12 months from that process that you can apply going forward, to kind of make sure we don't have this kind of kerfluffle or issues going forward.
"
2585,F,2019,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,2,"Okay, and then one quick last one on Ford Motor Credit.
Given the rate environment is shifting around on us in a direction nobody expected 12 months ago, you had the credit downgrade at Moody's.
I'm just curious, as you're managing Ford Motor Credit, has anything changed in the way you're thinking about the business? Where are we on the shift of getting better return on assets on sort of a constrained, a purposely constrained, asset base? Could we see returns improve, or profitability improve, as soon as next year, based on some of those actions?
"
2586,F,2019,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,3,"But has there been any shift in the portfolio so far, maybe away from dealer floor plan financing to maybe a higher margin retail business? I'm just trying to understand where we are in that shift.

Hi, everyone.
Ford's results this quarter demonstrate we are making progress on delivering on our commitments to customers and other stakeholders.
However, it's clear we have much more work to do.
We're focused on consistently improving customer experience and operational execution across our business.
We're making progress on our global redesign, making the tough choices to lay the groundwork for improvement and future growth, free cash flow, profitability and returns on capital.
We're positioning Ford to lead and win through fitness.
For example, holding structural costs flat to down, excluding pension and OPEB, and forming the JV with Mahindra.
We're prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable, long-term growth in mobility, and disciplined execution is driving strong results from Ford Credit.
In the third quarter, we generated $207 million adjusted free cash flow.
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was up 80% to $2.3 billion, supported by lower capital expenditures, higher distributions from Ford Credit, and continued improvement in working capital in our auto business.
Adjusted free cash flow is our most important financial measure, and we're committed to generating sustainable growth over time.
Cash and liquidity of $22 billion and $35 billion remain above our targets.
We remain committed to investment grade credit ratings and a strong balance sheet.
Wholesales declined 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by Europe, China and South America.
Revenue was down 2%, largely as a result of foreign exchange.
Auto EBIT was $1.3 billion in the quarter, with a margin of 3.9%, as higher pricing and flat structural costs, excluding pension and OPEB, were offset by higher materials costs associated with product launches, higher warranty expenses, and adverse currency exchange.
Our strategic investments in mobility increased 48%, as we continue to build out capabilities in connected services and autonomous vehicles.
At the end of this year, 100% of Ford's new vehicles in the US will be shipped with connectivity, and we are targeting 90% globally by the end of 2020.
Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, boasting a 9% increase in earnings before taxes.
Loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit, and auction values for off-lease vehicles were slightly better than expected.
We now believe auction values will be down about 2%, on average, for the full year, and receivables were $149 billion.
Corporate other of $18 million included mark-to-market and other investment gains of $113 million, including $77 million from Pivotal Software.
On an adjusted basis, company EBIT increased 8% to $1.8 billion, and our EBIT margin expanded to 40 basis points to 4.8%, driven by improvement in our businesses in China, North America, and Europe; mark-to-market gains in corporate other; and, another strong performance by Ford Credit.
EPS was $0.34 and our tax rate in the quarter was 10.7%.
In the third quarter, we recorded $1.5 billion in special item charges, with a cash effect of about $300 million.
Actions related to our global redesign accounted for $1 billion in EBIT, and a majority of the negative cash effects.
As expected, most of the third quarter global redesign charges refer to an impairment in India related to the planned formation of our joint venture with Mahindra.
Special charges in the quarter also included $300 million in non-cash pension remeasurement losses, and $187 million for an unfavorable customs ruling.
For the full year, we now expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of EBIT charges as a result of global redesign, with negative cash effects of about $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
Let me touch on a few areas of the business in more detail.
In North America, wholesale units were down modestly.
Launch-related ramp-up of all new Explorer and Escape, the overlap of very strong production of F-Series in the third quarter of last year to compensate for the decline in production volume caused by the Meridian fire, and our decision to exit low margin sedans were largely offset by the favorable impacts of our new Edge introduced at the end of 2018, and also Ranger.
As a reminder, we plan to start production of the new Super Duty in the fourth quarter.
Revenue grew 5%, supported by higher pricing and improved mix.
EBIT increased 3%, with a margin of 8.6%, driven by higher pricing and volumes in the US, which were partially offset by launch-related production costs and higher warranty expenses.
As a reminder, we expect to conclude our negotiations with the UAW in the fourth quarter, and to recognize the full impact of ratification-related payments as part of our adjusted results.
In Europe, wholesales declined 15%, primarily because of our redesign actions to exit low-margin businesses, including discontinuation of the C-MAX sedan.
Revenue, which was down 14%, or 9% excluding the impact of currency, was also affected by the lower volumes.
At the same time, the benefits of Europe's redesign were evident in EBIT, which improved 27% in the quarter.
This is the first time in three years that Ford has posted consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in European profitability.
This performance is attributable to lower structural costs, stronger product mix, and higher profits from our commercial vehicle JV, Ford Otosan.
Headwinds included the lower volumes and adverse currency exchange rates.
In China, wholesales declined 12% and consolidated revenue was down 27%, as improvements in mix and pricing were more than offset by lower volumes and component sales to the joint ventures in the country.
Our EBIT loss in China narrowed to $300 million, an improvement of $100 million year over year, driven by lower structural cost and favorable market factors in consolidated operations.
This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in profitability in China.
As Jim mentioned, we are working to stabilize our China business and working intensively to return it to profitable growth.
Dealer engagement and profitability are starting to improve, and we continue to keep production aligned to demand, to ensure appropriate levels of dealer stocks.
Please turn to Page 20.
While our third quarter results demonstrate positive improvements in the trajectory of some areas of our business, we clearly have a lot more work to do.
We are updating our outlook to reflect several headwinds that have intensified since we last gave guidance.
The first is higher warranty, particularly related to coverages.
The second is higher incentives planned in North America.
The third is China, due to lower volumes and JV profits.
Taking these factors into consideration, we are now targeting a full-year adjusted EBIT in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, compared with $7 billion last year.
This implies a fourth quarter adjusted EBIT range of $0.6 billion to $1.1 billion.
We continue to expect strong market factors, lower full-year auto structural costs, excluding pensions and OPEB, and strength in Ford Credit.
We still expect adjusted free cash flow to be up for the full year, driven by our auto business, and we remain committed to driving growth in cash flow and profitability over time.
We now expect a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of around 12% to 13%, which is lower than our previous expectation, largely driven by more clarity on provisions in the US Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017.
This would yield adjusted EPS in the range of $1.20 to $1.32, compared with $1.30 last year.
Relative to calls on capital for the year, we expect capex to be about $7.5 billion, down year over year, reflecting benefits from our fitness initiatives; funded pension contributions to be about $750 million; and shareholder distributions to be about $2.6 billion.
Our guidance assumes no material change in the current economic environment including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs.
Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Before we move to Q&A, there are couple of things I encourage you to keep in mind as you think about Ford, today and for the long term.
First, our customers are informing and driving everything we do.
That's why 2019 and 2020 are such robust launch years for us in North America.
We are bolstering our winning portfolio of vehicles based on what consumers want and need, reallocating capital to those higher return growth opportunities, and carrying out changeovers of our highest volume and most profitable vehicles.
Second, we're determined to always get better.
To persistently focus on our fitness, and continuously improve our operating productivity.
While we see increased headwinds in our fourth quarter, we have a bias for action and are intensely executing on the inputs that will enable us to capture the opportunities across our business that will allow us to drive free cash flow, along with long-term growth in revenue and profitability, including adjusted EBIT margins of 8% or better.
And, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and holding investment grade credit ratings.
Now, let's open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers:
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America.
"
2590,F,2019,3,timothy-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Well, it's exactly as you said.
From a warranty cost perspective, just to be clear, we do expect warranty to be up year over year.
Again, that's a key driver of our change in guidance for the fourth quarter.
The accruals we go through every quarter, of course, and accruals are appropriate and reflect the experiences we've seen with warranties to date through that point in time.
"
2591,F,2019,3,timothy-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"You bet.
This is Tim.
As it relates to Ford Credit, the cash distributions tend to track with profitability for Ford Credit, and that's been consistent over time.
That will just be a natural flow.
We haven't given specific Ford Credit cash flow guidance, but it certainly factored into our expectation that we'll have growth in free cash flow, and it's been part of the 80% growth we've seen year-to-date so far this year.
On the special items, the cash thus far in 2019 has been $0.7 billion, and we had said in Q2 that we expected $1.5 billion to $2 billion of cash.
We've had a deferral in that.
Similarly, earlier in the year we expected $2 billion to $2.5 billion cash.
We continue to refine our estimates of the cash ramifications from the restructuring actions that we're taking, and I now expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2019.
Again, $0.7 billion of which has already occurred.

Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO, and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer.
Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Businesses, Technology and Strategy; and David McClelland, CEO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of the quarter and progress against our strategic initiatives.
Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and then we'll turn to Q&A.
Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.
Our comments today will include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found, along with the rest of our earnings materials, at shareholder.ford.com.
Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 22 of our presentation.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year.
As a reminder, in 2020, we will update the business units in our automotive segment to align with changes to our management and reporting structure.
To help you with this transition, our earnings deck appendix has a schematic of the changes, including where certain joint ventures will be reported.
Also, our revised 2018 and 2019 results show how they will appear in the new reporting structure.
The investor relations team is available if you have specific questions about these changes.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.

2594,F,2019,3,lynn-antipas-tyson,executive-director-of-investor-relations,False,1,
2595,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn and hello, everyone.
Overall, the Ford team delivered solid operational results in the third quarter, while at the same time, we made further progress on the global redesign of the company.
We know, though, that we have much more work to do.
And this is the mandate at Ford, executing in the now, while transforming into a much more fit, agile and customer-centric company that can win in an era of rapid change and innovation.
Our team is operating with urgency and a focus to meet these challenges.
Please turn to Page 4.
Now touching briefly on the quarter, we generated positive adjusted free cash flow.
The year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was up 80%, largely driven by improvement in our automotive business.
In the quarter, we delivered $1.8 billion in company-adjusted EBIT.
That was up 8%, supported by improvement in our businesses in China, North America and Europe, as well as mark-to-market gains in corporate other, and another strong performance by Ford Credit.
And year-to-date EBIT for automotive, it was up 10%, and company-adjusted EBIT increased 6%.
Please turn to Page 5.
At the highest level, our global redesign is about making choices to transform Ford into a more fit and competitive company.
Simply put, we are absolutely committed to improving execution and addressing underperformance throughout the company.
I will walk you through our business region by region.
In our North American business, amid an intensified competitive environment, we are in the middle of an extensive product renewal.
Reminding you that we are significantly refreshing and growing our SUV portfolio, introducing models like the completely redesigned Ford Explorer and Escape, and our all-new Lincoln Aviator and Corsair.
I'm pleased to say that we are approaching now full production on the new Explorer and Aviator.
This product renewal comes as we also phase out our most traditional sedan silhouettes.
Now again, our intent isn't to give up customers in that sedan segment; rather, to enhance their view of Ford's potential to please them in even a better vehicle.
We also plan to protect and expand our leadership in pickups and commercial vehicles.
Look for a new Super Duty pickup in the coming months, and our all-new F-150 next year.
In a few weeks we're introducing a battery electric vehicle that is designed from the ground up, to offer stunning performance, gorgeous design and an incredible customer experience that is fully connected and updatable over time.
We also have big plans for the long-awaited rebirth of the Bronco franchise, so Ford is expanding in the battery electric vehicles and rugged off-road SUVs, challenging brands that have had those two growth areas to themselves for long enough.
In total, I remind you that we're in the process of replacing 75% of our North American lineup by volume, by the end of 2020, dramatically improving the freshness and appeal of our portfolio.
The Ford team in Europe is making rapid strides in restructuring the business.
We have reset our revenue and cost base and are rationalizing our product portfolio.
Europe is now focusing on three business groups.
A strong and growing commercial vehicle business, a smaller and more profitable passenger vehicle business, and a niche portfolio of profitable and brand-enhancing imported vehicles.
So going forward, you will see us redeploy capital to build on our position as Europe's number one commercial vehicle brand.
In addition, our country-specific product plans have us on track to deliver against the new European 2021 CO2 targets without penalties or fines, using new hybrid and electric propulsion choices.
We're clearly not satisfied with our standing China, and the team is working exhaustively to return to profitable growth in this important market.
We're working to stabilize the business, and are now launching new products that are tailored to the needs of Chinese customers.
At the same time, we are attacking costs, reinvigorating our dealer network, and improving sales and market capabilities.
In South America, we are restructuring our operations to be far more asset light.
As you know, we made the decision to exit our heavy truck business.
We reduced our management employee base by a full 20% and we downsized our regional headquarters and rationalized the dealer networks in both Brazil and Argentina.
Finally, we recently announced the formation of our International Markets Group.
We will refer to this as IMG, which brings together 100 high-potential emerged and emerging markets, including India, Australia, ASEAN, the Middle East, Africa and Russia.
This is all under one leadership team.
Emerging markets are growing at almost double the rate of the global industry.
By 2024, one in three vehicles in our industry will be sold in these markets.
Having the right business model to profitably address this opportunity is critical, and that's precisely what IMG will do.
Now, please turn to Page 6.
An important enabler of this strategy is the agreement we reached earlier this month with Mahindra.
A joint venture will help Ford profitably grow in India and unlock the low-cost product development capabilities we need to grow in emerging markets.
Ford will benefit from Mahindra's lower-cost platforms and value-focused engineering.
Mahindra, on the other hand, will gain from Ford's global reach, quality and technology, and that includes the battery electric vehicle.
We're also taking strategic actions to prepare Ford to compete and lead in an industry that is being profoundly reshaped through connectivity, the sharing economy, automation and new forms of propulsion.
You can think of this as smart vehicles for a smart world.
We are scaling products and businesses that connect to the world around them in ways that benefits customers.
With all elements of Ford Smart Mobility now in one organization led by Jim Farley, we are sharpening our focus on where to play and how to win across this broad mandate.
We're not able to reveal all the work we're doing in this exciting and fast-moving era, but there are few things that I can share.
We are prioritizing investments in Connected Vehicle Services that will improve the customer experience.
This will enable Ford to transition from what has been historically a largely product-led offering to an ever-improving and much stickier suite of products, accessories, services and experiences, all bundled together.
These investments have a sharp focus on customer data privacy and safety.
They will open new opportunities to realize value from connected vehicle data, and deliver outstanding experiences for our retail and commercial customers.
We'll have more to say about all of this in the future.
As you know, we're also developing mobility services like Spin, which is among the top three micro mobility companies in the US.
With a footprint in 60 markets and growing, and over 3 million rides year-to-date, Spin is expanding Ford's reach in areas that we believe will contribute to an even stronger base for our autonomous vehicle businesses.
Speaking of AVs, last month we announced Austin as our third market for autonomous vehicle services.
Together with Argo AI, we are currently mapping the city and will gradually increase the size of our fleet, like how we're rolling out operations in the first two cities, Miami and Washington, DC.
We are constantly learning from our expanding deployment of AV technology and services.
This space has shifted and evolved significantly, even since the formation of our AV LLC in 2018, and we expect it to remain dynamic in the coming years.
Our team is focused on building a successful, sustainable and scalable self-driving vehicle service.
To this end, we remain focused on our plan for initial commercialization of a self-driving service in 2021.
We will begin to scale that service once we're able to remove the safety driver from the vehicle.
Before I turn the call over to Tim, let me address our full-year outlook.
We are experiencing more headwinds than expected in our fourth quarter, especially higher warranty.
As a result, we have lowered our adjusted EBIT guidance range to $6.5 billion to $7 billion, which suggests we will not grow adjusted EBIT this year as we intended.
Of course we're disappointed in this, but we're confident that we're laying the groundwork for sustained improvement in profitability and cash flow over time.
In terms of warranty costs, we are feeling the downstream impact of some products designed earlier in the decade, but we've taken extensive actions to improve long-term quality and durability, including centralizing core engineering responsibility and bolstering our systems integration and design assurance processes.
Now these actions are already bearing fruit, as we are seeing an improving trend in quality studies on our models.
Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Stone.
"
2596,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Hey, John.
Jim Hackett.
Let me ask Joe to bring you up to date on that.
"
2597,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Thank you, Rod.
Operator
And our next question is going to come from the line of Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets.
"
2598,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Hi, Joe.
"
2599,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Joe, Joe Hinrichs can clear this up.
I am not happy with the press' view of the way we've worked through this.
I mean, I'm just going to tickle your fancy a little bit by having you understand how diverse supply chains are in the auto industry.
I mean, products come from all kinds of trajectories in terms of what makes them up.
There are no companies that are vertically integrated anymore, so the way the reporter talked about how things are moved around and shifted, as indication that the process was broken, that's just not fair.
We were doing things because we were trying to take some of the pressure off, this job per hour, or JPH, that Joe talked about, we could reduce some of the complexity.
That actually worked, so that was lay down was painted as a negative.
It was actually misrepresented.
What he was saying to you is that the wholesales were still down 19,000 units, but that was worse last quarter.
So we've made a lot of progress, but Joe, I don't know if you want to add more to that.
"
2600,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"In fact, that discipline is really important, because if we lose one customer, can you imagine the future cash flow loss of losing a customer? So it's better that we get this right.
The other thing, Joe, is if you follow the transit business or the F-150 business, those have multiple factories, so when we're in the middle of launches with those vehicles, there is relief because of the way Joe Hinrichs can move things around.
So I'm just echoing what he said to you, is Flat Rock was not evidence of chaos.
It was evidence of us making sure things were right.
"
2601,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"So, Tim, you can field this.
"
2602,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"And that's --
"
2603,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yeah, we haven't given any specific commentary on when and how the flows curve.
Again, they track with profitability over time.
"
2604,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Yeah, Brian, I'll turn that to David, but I have to smile, because I'm really proud of the brand, so I do think the brand carries when you're talking about F-150 pickup trucks and things like that.
But David, am I right about that?
"
2605,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Well again, Jim Hackett.
I'm going to warrant to you, the way we run this company is what I'd like to talk about, and there is a lot of integrity in the way we think about this balance sheet and the way we handle customers.
I don't really want to comment on the others.
There are practices that you would see that we would not accept at Ford Credit.
David?
"
2606,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Thank you, Brian.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.
"
2607,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Yeah, I think I should -- John, it's Jim Hackett.
I think I should confirm, that we have higher expectations for our performance, and its my experience, the short time that I've been here, that Ford is really good at this.
Joe can add some color here, but the challenge, what I call the design problem, is that we had to ramp down a really profitable vehicle.
We had to clear out the plant, literally bulldoze everything out, build a new plant inside, get it started and not drop any volume in the midst of that.
So, it was pretty aggressive and as I look at that, I want a win like that in the future, but we fell short in a few ways.
In fact, Joe just took my whole team through a deep dive on what we've learned from that.
I was very impressed with the granularity of what we do understand, of how the things that should have gone better didn't.
But what I am not concerned about is whether we get it and whether we have a grasp of how to get control of it.
I'll let Joe share with you, because of course we are getting daily updates, the latest status of where we are on Explorer.
"
2608,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Hi, Adam.
"
2609,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Good.
"
2610,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Yeah.
Well, I think your analysis, as always, is really good and I mean, imagine together the way we ask Joe Hinrichs to plan with the tariff structure that is in, it's up, it's out, it's down.
And so I do think that I've been public and said a year ago when asked about this, I thought there would be a resolution in the way that we'd have certainty and what I would say an equilibrium, if you remember, that we could plan our business.
Lincoln was responding really well to exports from here.
That is an example where there is blood in the patient, so to speak.
The brand was growing as fast as anything in the country, and we've made commitments.
People had made commitments to us.
I thought where you were going was also about the larger question of participation in China, which is something I'm still committed to.
I think there is a formula there, a business model that Ford can excel at.
But Joe, I don't know if there's any more.
You remember, Joe Hinrichs, who is now President of Automotive, also got us started in China, so he has had some, he was on the ground there and had experience.
But the question Adam is asking, you know, of is there false -- are we doing false things here that aren't sustainable?
"
2611,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"In fact, Adam, I loved when we had this exchange a year or so ago, I was doing the thing where I would bring up the computer industry as a proxy, and we were saying, can you convert that to thinking about automotive? You remember when computing was moving from chip size, Pentium, etc., and you would buy the next-generation computer based on that.
And of course, that's been blown up in terms of the way the markets now respond to computing; you know, what Apple has done in terms of the iPhone, we see the features and virtues, rather than what's inside of it.
I think this is going to happen now in automotive.
I give Jim Farley and Joe a lot of credit here, as Ford was leading in this way.
In other words, all the rhetoric was around, do you have electric vehicles? Or, do you have hybrid vehicles? We've got this exciting thing coming in November that is going to take advantage --
"
2612,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"I know, and what I want you to imagine with me is the dialog is going to start to shift, because the nature of the product is going to be what's talked about rather than the propulsion.
Of course, we're committed to that.
We've got this F-Series coming and of course you know we've been working on a battery electric inside of that.
Imagine when the Bronco comes, how exciting talking about Ford products is.
I just want to say that I love where you're going with the question, and I'm really excited about the way Ford is interpreting that.
Just a reminder, as battery costs improve or lower, hybrids also become more affordable.
It's not just about electric vehicles.
So that becomes also part of the equation for the customer.
"
2613,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Yeah, thank you.
Let me just close and say the third quarter results do have evidence of the global redesign of Ford.
When you heard the news about how Europe persistently now is improving, and it is driving these positive shifts.
But make no mistake, humility of the work that we still have to do, I'm still very confident in the team here and the progress that Ford Motor Company is making.
We're focused on improving our fitness and our outcomes.
This is driving a winning portfolio, where we're fortifying the strengths.
As you heard me just mention a moment ago to Adam, improving mix.
And we're focused on laying groundwork to improve the trajectory of long-term growth in cash flow and profitability.
That evidence is really starting to show up in the previous calls.
You all asked us, are you sure your structural costs aren't rising? You know, we really have attacked this and I think we have a good handle there.
And then a commitment by me personally that things that you would expect us to do better, that we are addressing, and we are.
Thank you very much for your attention this evening.

I'm going to hand it to David McClellan.
As a former bank board member managing through the crisis in this last decade, I'm really proud of the Ford Credit discipline.
In fact, our efficiencies improved.
We aren't using more leverage to improve returns, so we're very careful about that.
But David, you can talk about the great news we keep getting from Ford Credit.

And our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache Wolfe Research.
"
2618,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,23,"Hi, Rod.
"
2619,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,24,"Thanks, Rod.
This is like the Chicago thing, I just want to make it clear that the management team, starting with me, understand that warranty is an opportunity for us to fix things that underlie challenges in our processes or the way we've done things.
It's my early work that I got involved in, Rod.
In fact, when we met in New York in our first gathering, I talked to you about this.
That we attack the product development process with a lot of vigor, and you understand the gestation period in the auto industry.
So a lot of the improvement that we have made, Jim Farley, Joe Hinrichs, myself, Hau Thai-Tang, in getting the portfolio to generate all the new products that we're talking about coming, with less capital committed that was planned when this new regime started, $20 billion less.
I'm confident that the work, that the PD processes undertaken is going to generate better performance.
However, with that said, Joe and I are committed to control of our business and we've been surprised ourselves by some of these things, because these are -- Joe explained, products and service, some that are longer, three and four years out that, of course, we have to deal for our customers with problems, and we'll do that.
There is also with the DPS6 transmission, we made a decision as a team to remove any kind of question from ongoing ownership of the vehicles beyond really first ownership, that the company would stand behind the performance of the products.
This is a big Ford commitment, to make sure that no one was suffering through that product challenge.
I feel really good from what the company can control that we've got a handle on that.
Let me just summarize by saying, warranty is getting a lot of attention, and the first thing is that the PD process, it has been restructured in the smart redesign.
Hal's work there was kind of leading the company.
But the benefits of all that are in the next generation of products.
So Joe, maybe you can comment on these historical products, what we've learned.
"
2620,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,25,"Yeah, so Rod, on the go-forward warranty, what Tim and Joe have done in the expectations for the year, they've given you that in terms of the way the year has been projected.
We don't go out beyond that.
Of course, we have our normal reserve for warranty, but Tim, I'm going to let you add any color that might help him with that.
"
2621,F,2019,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,26,"Joe, you might talk about the color in Asia.

2622,F,2019,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,0,"Yes, good afternoon.
So, a couple of questions.
First, vis-a-vis Ford Credit, since a lot of the other questions have been asked, you know, I was a little bit surprised by the cut in, or the improvement in expected decline in auction values.
Given some softness we saw in Mannheim overall in the quarter, is there something specific to the kind of lease returns that you've been getting? Or, something that makes it a little bit better? And then as you kind of roll forward into next year, what's your expectation on that?
"
2623,F,2019,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,1,"Okay, good.
The second question, as long as we're going into Ford Credit, there has been a lot of negativity in the press around extended loan terms, subprime, underwater trade-ins being rolled into the loan, which would imply poor loan to values.
Can you comment A, just on the general industry trend there? And B, the Ford Credit specific approach to that?
"
2624,F,2019,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,2,"Okay, thank you.
"
2625,F,2019,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,3,
2626,F,2019,3,david-mcclelland,"chief-executive-officer,-ford-credit",False,0,"Yes.
John, hi, this is David.
I'm echoing what Jim is saying.
I'm very comfortable with the way the Credit company is going, the portfolio looks very strong.
I mentioned this in the last earnings call, and I haven't seen any change in that.
We manage, as you know, we manage our business, we've stated that we want to keep it around $150 billion.
We manage the leverage between 8 to 9 to 1, as Jim just mentioned.
You guys know how much equity is employed in the business, and you know that we expect to get, and we've made this quite public, between 8% and 12% return on that equity.
So, when you do the math, our expected earnings should be about $2 billion.
And this year, we've had, and you referenced it in your question, we've had good news interest rates versus what we'd expected, so we have seen that in our DMV numbers.
The used vehicle performance has been better than we expected.
We've said now that we think the used vehicles will be down about 2% for the year.
We're about 1.8% so far for the year.
I know that that's slightly different to what [Indecipherable] has said, but then I look specifically at the trend last year on used vehicles and I look at what happened in the fourth quarter last year.
And then most importantly, I look at the return mix, and the demand [Phonetic] is actually off the 2001 segmentations, so when you look specifically at the Ford Credit return mix, I feel comfortable that 2% is about right.
So overall -- sorry, go ahead.
"
2627,F,2019,3,david-mcclelland,"chief-executive-officer,-ford-credit",False,1,"No, the floor plan in the US, the amount of floor plan we do in the US is pretty constant, and we expect it to stay there.
We do most of the floor plan in Europe, and we haven't seen a change in China.
Our FICO is pretty constant and our sort of marginal business, as you've seen over the last 10 quarters, remain constant at 6%, so we're not seeing any change.
"
2628,F,2019,3,david-mcclelland,"chief-executive-officer,-ford-credit",False,2,"Thanks for the question.
I think I touched on it a little earlier.
So, we look at the performance year-to-date, which is down just short of 2%, and then I looked at the performance last year, throughout the year and the trends actually over the last few years, and then what happened last year in the fourth quarter.
And then, specifically and importantly, look at the return mix, which is what Jim was getting at.
If you look at the return mix, remember Mannheim is off a really historical mix.
So if you look at our specific return mix, I feel comfortable that the 2% number is about right.
"
2629,F,2019,3,david-mcclelland,"chief-executive-officer,-ford-credit",False,3,"Sure.
Yeah, thanks.
Again, echoing what Jim said, not to talk about outside of Ford Credit, but I can talk with some confidence about the credit company itself.
The business that we're putting on the books remains very strong.
Our FICO For the quarter is 750, and we're not moving at all on any of the higher risk business that we're doing.
And then, really to the heart of your question, we are not in the longer terms.
We're not, even if the average transaction price is going up, we're not seeing any movement on our longer-term business, which the mix of that, the 84 month is only 3%.
There's nothing that I'm seeing in the performance in terms of delinquency, even the early, early defaults, non-delinquent defaults, are not moving, 30, 60, 90s are fine.
in our slides, there is a seasonality on the LTR, but that is simply seasonality.
Just look at 2Q18 versus 2Q19.
Your prior questions about the disposal in terms of the residual values are pretty good.
So, I mean we're staying diligent, but I'm comfortable and confident that what you're reading about is not what you're seeing in the credit company.

2631,F,2019,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Hi, good afternoon.
I guess I want to turn back to North America and back into the Explorer a little bit.
You mentioned wholesales in North America were down slightly, in the US they were up slightly.
I think that's pretty close to what you did from a production standpoint.
I guess the real question is, were all those Explorers that we read about the challenges, about wholesaled this quarter? Are there vehicles at Flat Rock, as has been reported? And even if they are at Flat Rock, are they wholesaled? I guess if they were wholesaled, or sent to dealers, if you're just still doing rework on them, is that also some of the costs that might be considered in the fourth quarter?
"
2632,F,2019,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"Okay.
The automotive free cash flow is still higher year over year.
I noticed in the quarter the Ford Credit distribution was up, and I think year-to-date now it's at $2.4 billion, which I think is only slightly below what you sort of kind of previously indicated for the year.
Within that guidance, are you raising the Ford Credit distribution for this year? Because maybe the performance of Ford Credit is stronger? And then while we're on cash flow, just maybe if you could provide an update on some of the cash with the redesigned cash flow, because again, that looks sort of light, the $1.5 billion to $2 billion you've indicated prior to this year, unless there's a big fourth quarter.
"
2633,F,2019,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,2,"Just to be clear on the Ford Credit distribution, I guess versus what you thought after the second quarter, embedded in the automotive free cash, is the distribution higher than prior?
"
2634,F,2019,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,3,"Okay.

All right.
Our next question is going to come from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays.

2636,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer-,none,False,0,"This is Tim.
Let me start with what we've been seeing, as you said.
So, in Europe, we saw an improvement of $126 million in the quarter, that's year-over-year, and that's the first year-over-year improvement we've seen in two years.
That's a reflection of the redesign initiatives and is focused on the customer commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and imports from portfolio standpoint.
So a positive $53 million profit in Europe and that's driven by the market factors and commercial vehicles and structural cost declines ex-pension.
In China, again, loss of negative $155 million, but the EBIT improved $328 million year-over-year, and that's compared with Q1 momentum of $22 million improvement.
So, it went from $22 million to $328 million.
And as Joe mentioned earlier, the deal health is much improved, the best it's been from an inventory perspective in 18 months.
And the China results were driven by Lincoln volume, the structural cost improvements and a favorable exchange.
So pleased with what we're seeing in Europe and China.
And from a guidance perspective, looking forward, we expect $7 billion, $7.5 billion and the EPS to be driven by -- or led by the North America, Europe and China with structural costs and the market factors being the key drivers.
"
2637,F,2019,2,"david-tamberrino -- goldman-sachs-group,-inc.",analyst,False,0,"Yeah.
I'm going to keep picking at this point on structural costs.
It was a positive tailwind of about $300 million in the first quarter and now you've got a negative in the second quarter, it was negative in North America and negative in Europe.
Really want to unpack that and understand what the positive was ex-pension and OPEB.
And if you expect that to be repeatable, do you expect to see that grow sequentially as we progress through the year after you've taken restructuring actions? That is my first question.
"
2638,F,2019,2,"david-tamberrino -- goldman-sachs-group,-inc.",analyst,False,1,"But you can't share the magnitude that it was down ex-pension and OPEB and there is no incremental color on Europe taking a step backwards from the benefits you saw in 1Q?
"
2639,F,2019,2,"david-tamberrino -- goldman-sachs-group,-inc.",analyst,False,2,"Okay.
So then asking that restructuring question, I guess, you've made some announcements more recently, you finished the consultation process with your partners within Europe.
When do you anticipate the ability to provide some color as to the potential cost savings that you should be seeing as a result of those actions?
"
2640,F,2019,2,"david-tamberrino -- goldman-sachs-group,-inc.",analyst,False,3,"Okay.
So nothing to share today on the recent actions on annualized cost savings?

Hi, everyone.
A few things to keep in mind as we discuss our results.
First, both 2019 and 2020 are robust launch years for us as we bolster a winning portfolio for customers, reallocate capital to higher return growth opportunities and execute changeovers of our most profitable and highest volume vehicles.
Second, our global redesign and fitness initiatives are progressing well, improving the trajectory of future growth, cash flow, profitability and returns on capital.
Third, Ford Credit continues to deliver excellent results.
And, fourth, relative to auto, we continue to expect strong execution this year, especially in North America, Europe and China.
In the quarter, we generated $0.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow, which was a significant improvement from last year.
This performance includes the impact of our launches in the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow was up 80% to $2.1 billion, supported by improvement in working capital in auto.
The ability to generate sustainable growth in free cash flow over time is our most important financial measure and we are on our way to achieving this.
Wholesales declined 9%, driven by China, lower industry and the launch-related volume impact from North America, as we ramped Explorer and Police Interceptor.
Interceptor, by the way, accounted for half of all police vehicle sales in the US last year and the new model is even more capable.
Although wholesales were down, revenue was flat, as strong mix and pricing supported by our franchise strengths were offset by lower volumes and adverse exchange.
Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue grew 3%.
Auto posted a second consecutive quarter of EBIT growth, something we have not achieved in over three years.
EBIT grew 19%, up from 16% last quarter, and EBIT margin expanded by 60 basis points.
These results were supported by strong mix in North America, reflecting our franchise strengths and strong pricing in every region.
In North America, EBIT declined 3%, driven by the changeover of Explorer, Interceptor and the introduction of Lincoln's all-new Aviator, as well as higher warranty.
Our strategic investments in Mobility increased by 46% as we continue to build out our capabilities, including mobility services, connectivity and autonomy.
Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, posting a 29% increase in earnings before taxes.
Favorable loss metrics reflected healthy consumer credit conditions and auction values for off-lease vehicles performed slightly better than expectations.
We now believe auction values will be down by about 3% on average for the year.
Receivables were flat and remain below our previously announced cap of $155 billion.
Corporate other expense of $286 million included a mark-to-market loss of $181 million for our investment in Pivotal.
On an adjusted basis, both company EBIT and margin for the quarter were flat at $1.7 billion and 4.3%, and EPS was $0.28.
Excluding the Pivotal loss, adjusted EBIT would have been $1.8 billion, EBIT margin would have been 4.7%, and EPS would have been $0.32.
In the quarter, we've recorded a $1.2 billion of special charges with cash effects of $0.2 billion.
As expected, the vast majority of the charges in the quarter were associated with the redesigns of Europe and South America.
This year, we continue to expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of EBIT charges with negative cash effects of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion, reflecting a shift of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion in cash effects to 2020.
Lastly, we ended the quarter above our cash and liquidity targets with $23 billion in cash and $37 billion in total liquidity.
Let me touch on the few areas of the business in more detail.
In North America, as I mentioned, EBIT was down and margin contracted by 30 basis points to 7.1%.
The region continued to deliver strong mix in net pricing supported by F-Series, as well as our decision to exit traditional sedans.
This favorability was more than offset with the launch-related declines in volume and higher warranty.
For additional perspective, wholesales for Explorer, Interceptor were down by 72,000 units year-over-year, which led the 7% overall decline in wholesales in the quarter.
As Jim mentioned, demand for Explorer is strong with production already oversubscribed.
Relative to wholesales, it's interesting to note that in the quarter sales of Ranger completely offset the decline from discontinued sedans.
Last quarter, we showed you the benefit of this intentional shift in our portfolio using our Michigan assembly plant as an example.
Once this plant completes the transition from sedans to Ranger and Bronco, EBIT will improve by over $1 billion.
In the US, our SUVs posted strong momentum in the quarter, including a 50% increase in Expedition and this month based on healthy customer demand, we started to run additional capacity for Expedition in our Kentucky Truck Plant.
By the end of this year, on a volume-weighted basis, we will have the freshest SUV lineup in the industry, led by our all-new Explorer and all-new Escape.
Also in the US, sales of total pickups accelerated in the quarter, marking our best overall pickup sales performance since 2004.
F-Series continues to do well, maintaining market leadership with the lowest incentive spend of primary competitors and the highest transaction pricing.
Ranger, which we launched at the end of 2018, more than doubled its volume sequentially, while also steadily increasing segment share to 14.2%.
Europe delivered $53 million in EBIT in the quarter, an improvement of $126 million year-over-year, supported by our redesign actions.
Favorable market factors aided by flat structural costs, excluding pension, drove the improvement in profitability.
This is the first quarterly year-over-year improvement in profitability for Europe in two years.
Commercial vehicles were once again a strength in the quarter, as Ford remained Europe's number one commercial vehicle brand.
And, as noted in our product roadmap, we will be launching an updated two-ton Transit in the second half of this year.
In addition, Ford remained the market leader in the UK with Fiesta, Transit, Custom and Focus as the top three selling models.
In China, consolidated revenue increased 48% year-over-year, driven by higher Lincoln volumes.
EBIT loss narrowed to $155 million, an improvement of $328 million year-over-year, supported by improvements in consolidated operations in volume, mix and pricing, lower tariffs and structural costs, as well as favorable exchange.
The team has taken action to stabilize sales with second quarter retail sales up 13% sequentially and aggressive reductions in inventory to improve dealer health.
In fact, our dealer inventory is at its lowest level in the past 18 months and we managed the run out of Stage V effectively.
In addition, China has implemented initiatives ranging from enhanced capabilities with in-depth Chinese market experience to strengthening cooperation with joint venture partners.
Sales of our new Ford Territory SUV accelerated in the second quarter, making it the best-selling Ford SUV in China this year.
Now, let me turn to our updated outlook for the year, which focuses on growth in cash flow and profitability.
We continue to target an improvement in adjusted free cash flow year-over-year driven by Auto, and we are now introducing a range for full-year adjusted EBIT of between $7 billion and $7.5 billion compared with $7 billion last year, representing up to 7% growth.
These targets include continued strength in market factors and improved structural cost, excluding pension, led by North America, China and Europe, as well as launch-related impacts and strength in Credit.
As a reminder, we expect to conclude our negotiations with the UAW in the fourth quarter.
Assuming a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of between 18% and 20%, which would be up from 10% last year, we are introducing an adjusted EPS range of $1.20 to $1.35 compared with $1.30 last year.
The tax headwind is worth roughly $0.12 to $0.16 in EPS for the year.
Given the cadence of product launches and normal seasonality, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT to be higher than the third.
Among other things, these targets are based on the current economic environment, including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs.
Relative to calls on capital for the year, we continue to expect capex to be similar to last year at roughly $7.7 billion, funded pension contributions to be about $650 million and shareholder distributions to be about $2.6 billion.
A few final comments before we move to Q&A.
2019 and 2020 are robust product launch years for us, as we bolster our winning portfolio for customers, reallocate capital to higher return growth opportunities, and execute changeovers of our most profitable and highest volume vehicles.
Our results this quarter and year-to-date demonstrate the trajectory of our business is meaningfully improving, supported by our product portfolio, global redesign, and fitness initiatives.
We have many opportunities across our business to drive free cash flow, long-term growth in revenue and profitability, including EBIT margins of 8% or better, and we continue to be committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings.
Now, let's open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers:

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
Emmanuel?
"
2644,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,1,"Hi.
"
2645,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,2,"Great.
Thanks, Jim.
So, as I mentioned earlier, we had $1.2 billion in charges in the second quarter and then from a year-to-date standpoint it's $1.7 billion in charges and we're seeing $3 billion to $3.5 billion for the full year.
So it certainly implies you have quite a ways to go yet for the rest of the year.
Further detail on that would -- it wouldn't be a probably the same, we had made the decision on the ideas we have for the redesign, but -- that against the total backdrop of $11 billion over the next several years, all of which will provide us with opportunity over time to fundamentally continue to improve the underlying business and our cash generation growth opportunities and so forth.
And then from a cash standpoint, we have had $0.2 billion in cash this quarter and so far year-to-date $0.4 billion and we're expecting $1.5 billion to $2 billion for the year now.
Last quarter, we thought it may be closer to $2.5 billion.
So it has some deferral of $0.5 billion to $1 billion in 2020.
But, as you said, ways to go yet and lots of opportunity ahead to continue to redesign the business for the future.
"
2646,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,3,"Yeah.
Thanks, Colin.
So on the commodity front, we were at $0.2 billion adverse in the first half, but beyond what we've seen thus far is recent macro trends, our expectations that's factored into the guidance.
So there is no further commentary I’d offer for the back half of the year.
"
2647,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,4,
2648,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,5,"You bet.
So thanks for the question, Emmanuel.
As you said, with the $4.1 billion in the books in the first half, the guidance range is $7 billion to $7.5 billion with growth up to 7% or $0.5 billion implies $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion, $3.4 billion, excuse me, in the second half.
And as we said on the call is through these cadence of product launches and you can see in the materials we distributed on Slide 5, the winning portfolio slide, we got a number of launches ahead of us through the remainder of this year and continue to ramp up on Explorer and Aviator.
We have Corsair, Escape, Kuga, the two-ton Transit, for example, and then normal seasonality as well.
So, for example, in 2018, 56% of our profits came in in the first half of the year and, as a reminder, again, we had -- we have UAW negotiations concluding this fourth quarter.
So we believe the guidance is appropriate based on what we're seeing in the business and including the risks and opportunities and that was appropriate to provide a range for the year.
"
2649,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,6,"Thank you.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
John?
"
2650,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,7,"No, that's great.
Thank you.
"
2651,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,8,"Good, congratulations.
So on the structural costs, North America Auto overall -- sorry, it was good Auto overall.
So EBIT increased to 19% year-over-year, up from 16%, the first time in over three years, two consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in profit and that's driven by structural costs.
The commentary that I want to leave you with is, structural costs are down ex-pension and OPEB overall.
So as far as how that plays out for the rest of the year, again, that's factored into our one of the many inputs into our guidance.
"
2652,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,9,"Yeah.
So, again, as it relates to what's going to happen for the remainder of the year that's factored into our guidance, I'll go back to contract and structural costs.
Ex-pension and OPEB is flat or sorry down in Auto overall.
So what you’re seeing there is us continuing to execute on our fitness initiatives in the redesign and starting to see the early benefits from that in the overall EBIT results and the structural costs as well for the -- across the business.
"
2653,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,10,"Not at this point.
I mean if you look at the fact that we continue to announce additional redesign actions in Europe.
For example, Bridgend and then we continue to execute on our redesign initiatives and as those play out, over time, you'll see the benefits flow through the P&L.
"
2654,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,11,"Yeah.
The cost savings that we're expecting from the redesign, the restructuring actions are factored into the guidance for 2019.
And as we go forward and give guidance for '20, you'll see that reflected there moving as swiftly as practical to execute on all of the redesign initiatives that we have in front of us.
As we talked about, we have had $1.2 billion in the quarter, $1.7 billion year-to-date in charges.
We still have a ways to go, but 2019 outlook is for $3 billion to $3.5 billion and then similarly from a cash standpoint, but those are redesign and restructuring initiatives are also factored into the European long-term target of 6%.
"
2655,F,2019,2,timothy-stone -- chief-financial-officer,none,False,12,"No, at this stage, no.

2656,F,2019,2,adam-jonas -- morgan-stanley.,analyst,False,0,"Hi, everybody.
Good evening.
First, my first question is John Murphy is a grandpa?

2657,F,2019,2,adam-jonas -- morgan-stanley.,analyst,False,1,
2658,F,2019,2,adam-jonas -- morgan-stanley.,analyst,False,2,"Okay.
I mean it's just a big statement.
I mean, I think you're around 120, you have to get to 95, and maybe you can import some of the non-MEB BEVs, but I imagine that would be pretty small volumes.
So it just stands out as -- we can take it offline, it stands out as a really big gap to cross in such a short time, that's more an observation.
"
2659,F,2019,2,adam-jonas -- morgan-stanley.,analyst,False,3,"Okay.
The second question -- Thanks, Jim.
Second question is, maybe for, I don't know Dave McClelland or Joe and you could take this on a Ford Credit side.
If I asked you, obviously money and supply of money and availability of credit is historically still pretty strong, maybe not as strong as it's ever been, but still in a strong category.
I'm wondering if you see anything -- if I push you, anything that you're seeing incrementally that might be a yellow light or a flickering green light in terms of credit quality at the margin or anything on the funding side or consumer behavior delinquency side at all.
Obviously, there is some natural seasoning and cyclicality.
I just wanted to know if there's anything that you thought was a little -- taking a little closer look at.
Thanks.
"
2660,F,2019,2,adam-jonas -- morgan-stanley.,analyst,False,4,"Great, David.

This is -- or good afternoon.
This is Aileen Smith on for John.
First question on the structural cost headwind in North America.
Can you detail what these costs were specifically in the quarter and how you think about controlling or offsetting some of these going forward, particularly ahead of the UAW negotiations that you know and what could be labor cost inflation among other factors?
"
2663,F,2019,2,aileen-smith -- bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,analyst,False,1,"Thank you very much.
He'll appreciate that.
"
2664,F,2019,2,aileen-smith -- bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,analyst,False,2,"Okay.
That's helpful.
And then second question on the year-over-year China walk.
As you think about the outlook for the rest of the year and particularly into 2020, do you view positive contribution from volume mix, pricing, cost and everything else is being sustainable, particularly in the face of a tough industry backdrop or are one of these factors or other is going to be a bigger driver of profitability improvement?
"
2665,F,2019,2,aileen-smith -- bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,analyst,False,3,"Great.
That's very helpful.
Thanks for the question.

And our next question is from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs.
David?

2667,F,2019,2,"david-mcclelland -- chief-executive-officer,-ford-credit",none,False,0,"Sure.
So, Adam, evening.
This is David.
Tim mentioned in his introduction that the credit environment look pretty healthy and if I think about your question and look at our portfolio, I look at the originations, the strength of what we're seeing coming through the door is still really strong.
Our average FICO is nearly 750 and we're not seeing any change in the higher risk mix of business.
We’re sitting at 5%, that hasn't moved.
In fact, generally subprime placements are lower quarter-over-quarter.
There is no increase in term -- our average term is 65 months and the industry is 69.
We're not seeing any growth in 84 months.
So at origination, I don't see any flickering at all.
It's solidly green.
And then if I look at the performance of the portfolio, the portfolio continues to perform well.
In fact, quarter-over-quarter, our loss ratios have improved, 60-day delinquency is done, repossession rate is done, and then even if I look at our leases we've seen better than expected performance at auction.
We now had constant mix thing that the used vehicle prices only be down 3%.
So, as Tim said, it's healthy.
I think, yes, to use your terminology, it's solidly green.

Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer.
Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Businesses, Technology & Strategy; and David McClelland, CEO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of the quarter and our progress against our strategic initiatives.
Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results, and then we'll turn to Q&A.
Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussions include forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance.
Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 68.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.
Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.

2671,F,2019,2,ryan-brinkman -- jp-morgan-chase-&-co.,analyst,False,0,"Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
It's great to see on Slide 40 in the appendix so many EBIT drivers of the consolidated operations in China being positive year-over-year in 2Q amidst a tough industry.
With that said, given the relative size of the consolidated and the non-consolidated operations in China, it would seem the biggest opportunity for improvement is probably in the JVs, which were roughly flat year-over-year in 2Q.
Can you give us some indication of what is happening within that relatively placid $4 million change in EBIT or equity income? I imagine material volume declines may be offset by cost.
And then I think you have downplayed expectations for much improvement in the JVs this year given the obvious industry headwinds and that the improvement will instead come from the consolidated ops.
But going forward how much of a driver do you think improving JV income could be and when might we start to see some evidence of that?

So first question is on European CO2.
I think I heard you right, you said that you're going to make the CO2 emission standards without buying any credits and paying any penalties.
But my understanding is that, those penalty start kicking in 2020 when you need to get to 95 grams and you're not going to have a BEV on sale.
So I just want to confirm, you think you're going to get to 95 grams without BEVs?
"
2674,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,0,"So, quickly, I'll add.
We have Super Duty launch toward the end of the year, which is really important and the seasonality is real.
We have the European shutdowns and we have the North American shutdowns in the summer months and then, of course, there are the holidays later in the year.
So there is the annual seasonality.
So it's launches, seasonality and UAW negotiations.
Thanks.
"
2675,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,1,"Well, obviously, the bigger launches are in North America and [Technical Issues].
I'll leave it at that.
"
2676,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,2,"Sure.
Thanks.
So, clearly, we're glad to see the progress we saw in the first half of the year financially, especially on our consolidated results.
And if you think about China in the last couple of months, we had very aggressive sell down of the Stage V emissions vehicle, especially in June.
So I think you start -- I know you'll see some of the payback in the second half of the year, especially starting in July for some of that.
So we're watching what's happening in the industry there.
Tim mentioned earlier that we are at the lowest level of our dealer inventories in 18 months.
So we're feeling really good about where we are, both with our Stage V, Stage VI transition and dealer inventory overall and we're starting to see an improvement in dealer profitability.
So we're pleased with that.
Our focus in Territory products are building momentum.
We still have a ways to go, but they're building momentum and we have other products coming, as Tim referred to, especially Escape later in the year.
Remember that year-over-year we'll have -- we should -- we -- at this present state, we have lower tariffs than we had in the second half of '18, because of the import duties going into China are15%, which they were at 40% in the second half of last year.
So that's -- right now, that's positive year-over-year.
I think we're all watching what's happening in the Chinese industry.
I wouldn't go too much into it.
I think we have to see how things settle down after the last couple of months of the Stage V, Stage VI transition, but we do expect some payback to that in the second half of the year.
"
2677,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,3,"No, Jim Hackett, Jim Hackett is the grandpa[Speech Overlap]
"
2678,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,4,"Yeah, Adams, this is Joe, thanks for the question.
It's been getting a lot of attention.
So you're right, and the regulations in Europe are not new to us.
We've been planning for this really since 2013, and we have built the cost of this into our -- of the compliance into our business plans.
We will do it with electrification and improvements to our ICE powertrains.
So both important parts of the compliance plan.
As we said, we don't anticipate incurring fines or purchasing credits assuming consumer demand is there for the new products.
I wouldn't assume that we won't have a BEV in the marketplace.
We said electrification and improvement to ICE powertrains are part of that.
But we feel very confident in our compliance plans and we've been planning for this for quite some time.
"
2679,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,5,"Yeah.
Sure.
So, thanks for the question.
There is no question that in order for us to achieve the results, we're looking for over time in China our joint ventures, especially the Changan Ford joint ventures needs to improve its performance.
I'd say that we have a lot of work to do.
You referenced the consolidated operations -- improvements in the second quarter and first half of the year.
And part of it is the volume losses that we've seen and due to sales, but also managing the inventory down to the lowest level in 18 months.
We feel good about that, but going forward we've just rebuilt the marketing and sales organization over the last several months with some very good hires and some very good restructuring.
We're getting very strong participation with our joint venture partner, especially Changan and the rework we're doing with our marketing and sales organization and the dealer relations.
It's going to take some time to rebuild all of that, but I would say that we're on a path that we've seen over the last couple of months, we saw stability in our sales really for the first time in -- by 18 months or so.
We have a lot of work to do.
Part of it will be cost, of course.
We have right-sized at least the manning part of our manufacturing, there's a lot more work to do, given the lower volumes on the overall manufacturing footprint.
But the biggest opportunity for us is to rebuild the dealer profitability, the dealer engagement and the marketing and sales organization in the joint venture and what to see -- how that -- how long that takes, but we are making some good progress.
But we think it's going to take some more time.
And so -- then, of course, the new products.
Remember that, we said that we're going to localize five more vehicles starting in '19 that will help the joint venture, because the number of those products like Explorer, Lincoln, Corsair are built in the joint venture.
So, some of that localization will really help the joint venture and of course the new product launches we have over the next 18 months will help in the JV as well.
That's clearly our number one focus.
"
2680,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,6,"Yeah.
Anning starting this -- in November.
"
2681,F,2019,2,"joseph-r.-hinrichs -- president,-automotive",none,False,7,"So not even close to a year and really starting to gain some momentum there.

2683,F,2019,2,emmanuel-rosner -- deutsche-bank,analyst,False,0,"Hi.
Good evening, everybody.
"
2684,F,2019,2,emmanuel-rosner -- deutsche-bank,analyst,False,1,"So my first question is about the second half guidance implied by your full-year guidance.
At the midpoint, if I focus on the EBIT metric, it looks like your EBIT -- you're guiding for an EBIT that would be down about $1 billion between the first half and the second half.
And I was hoping you could maybe bucket this for us into what the main drivers are.
It seems like you're flagging launches, in particular, but obviously the second quarter had quite a bit of that as well.
So maybe just from a high level point of view, second half lower by $1 billion versus first half, what drives that?
"
2685,F,2019,2,emmanuel-rosner -- deutsche-bank,analyst,False,2,"And that's very helpful.
And then just, sort of, as a follow-up.
Would you be able to give us a sense, again, second half versus first half, how you think about it for your main regions, I assume that the bulk of the decline is North America, at least based on the launches that you highlighted.
But is there any other region where you expect this to be the case and in particular in North America anything else besides sort of like the launches, that's a big bucket?
"
2686,F,2019,2,emmanuel-rosner -- deutsche-bank,analyst,False,3,"Great.
"
2687,F,2019,2,emmanuel-rosner -- deutsche-bank,analyst,False,4,
2688,F,2019,2,rod-lache -- wolfe-research,analyst,False,0,"Hi, everybody.
I wanted to just ask, again, about this -- just the regional performance, it doesn't sound like you want to talk too much about this with any specificity, but it seems logical that Europe and Asia improvement should continue year-over-year and what you're guiding to is a decline in North America related to launches, but can you help us frame this international improvement? There have been a number of announcements that you've made and you continue to work through this restructuring.
How much of the cost improvement that you're looking at it in China and in Europe we are already seeing reflected as a run rate in the Q2 numbers? And maybe at a high level, could you talk a little bit about what you still have ahead of you?
"
2689,F,2019,2,rod-lache -- wolfe-research,analyst,False,1,"Okay.
There is [Speech Overlap]
"
2690,F,2019,2,rod-lache -- wolfe-research,analyst,False,2,"Okay.
That's helpful.
And just switching gears, my second question is just -- if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the market for full-size pickups, I guess, from a volume perspective things look fine, from a share perspective Ram is inching into the fleet market quite a bit, any kind of high level thoughts about what the prospects are for that market from your perspective?
"
2691,F,2019,2,rod-lache -- wolfe-research,analyst,False,3,"Thank you.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.
Adam, your line is open.

2692,F,2019,2,rod-lache -- wolfe-research,analyst,False,4,
2693,F,2019,2,colin-langan -- ubs-investment-bank,analyst,False,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
Just to start off, I mean, if you look at the guidance for global redesign cost, you're trending well below the full-year target, the outlook.
Does that imply that there is still more major step coming through the year and given the size of these targets, does that mean something going to be coming over the next few months? Any color there on how much more action we should be expecting?
"
2694,F,2019,2,colin-langan -- ubs-investment-bank,analyst,False,1,"Got it.
In the quarter, commodity costs have really come down quite dramatically and I know your contracts are lagged, but are we looking into the second half, I mean is that going to be a tailwind and are you factoring in a tailwind to your guidance or any color there on the commodity?
"
2695,F,2019,2,colin-langan -- ubs-investment-bank,analyst,False,2,"Okay.
Thank you very much for taking my question.

2696,F,2019,2,colin-langan -- ubs-investment-bank,analyst,False,3,
2697,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,0,"Thank you, Lynn, and hello to everyone.
As we meet today, we're a little past the midpoint of 2019, which we said would be a great year of execution for Ford.
And I am pleased with the progress we're making toward creating a more dynamic, innovative and profitably growing business.
And our second quarter results demonstrate the global redesign of Ford is driving positive shifts in our business.
We are improving our fitness or our ability to compete and the trajectory of the company is improving in terms of growth, cash flow, and profitability.
We are making tremendous progress in Europe, which I will expand on in a moment.
We are also seeing discrete signs of stability in our business in China, even as the economy and vehicle market there are under recent and persistent stress.
At the same time, we are actively working on the design and launch of new products that will help us grow in this market.
Now, additionally, the redesign and restructuring of our business in South America is on track as well.
We view all of this progress with humility, and the reason is that it's been my experience that the compounding positive effects of getting so many aspects of our business in shape does take more time.
Yet, at the same time, these disparate aspects build on each other, which allows us to reach our full potential as an outstanding business.
I'll touch briefly on some other highlights from the quarter.
In Automotive, we delivered a 19% increase in EBIT, supported by a broad-based improvement in market factors led by North America, Europe and China.
We achieved these results even with the natural drag on profitability in North America from ramping three very important product launches in the quarter; our all-new Explorer and Police Interceptor Utility, as well as our new-to-market Lincoln Aviator.
Now, if you recall, in Q1, we said our first quarter results would be the strongest of the year in part because of the magnitude and cadence of these future product launches, as well as normal seasonality.
Importantly, we delivered positive adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, significantly better than last year notwithstanding major launch headwinds.
And on a year-to-date basis, we delivered $2.1 billion adjusted free cash flow, which is up 80%.
In addition, our cash balance of $23 billion and total liquidity of $37 billion remained strong and well above our target levels.
Our year-to-date results support our target to improve both free cash flow and profitability this year.
Tim will go into more detail about our results and perspectives on the full-year in just a moment.
Now, as we've discussed in the past, we're focused on four strategic areas for creating value.
First is the winning portfolio, where we are fortifying our strengths, improving mix and expanding our commitment to electric vehicles.
Second is fitness.
It's our ability to compete, including advancing alliances, such as those with VW and Mahindra.
Third is the acceleration of our global redesign, which was to ensure each of our regions in generating sustainable profitable growth and cash flow.
And fourth, is smart vehicles for a smart world.
We are scaling products and businesses that connect to the world around them in ways that benefits our customers.
Let me touch on a few highlights of each of these.
We're now beginning to rollout our new portfolio, powered by the dramatic shifts in capital allocation to trucks, SUVs and performance vehicles, including the hybrid and all-electric offerings.
This chart you see covers 2019 and 2020.
We're expanding our lineup where the volume and profit is, where the growth is and where the Ford brand excels.
Of course, this includes pickups like the new F-150, Super Duty and new Ranger; commercial vans like the new two-ton Transit and SUVs such as the new Explorer, Escape, Territory and Puma; rugged off-road vehicles like the Raptor and upcoming Bronco; and our Mustang-inspired BEV, that's going to be an SUV.
In fact, in North America, we're driving down the age of our passenger vehicle showroom by almost one-half, as we replace 75% of our products by 2020.
Over time, the new models we're adding for customers will more than make up for any share and volume loss by the phase out of sedans, while simultaneously improving profitability and returns.
It's no small feat to deliver this many new products in such a short timeframe.
I’m fortunate that I have a seasoned automotive veteran in Joe Hinrichs at the helm of our Automotive division.
When you witness the extent of the work that was done, much of it like clockwork, we will complete our assignment to successfully launch these products.
For example, the transformation of our Chicago plant to launch the Explorer, the Police Interceptor and the new Lincoln Aviator was in some ways a bigger endeavor than the 2014 overhaul of our truck plants in Dearborn and Kansas City for our aluminum bodied F-150.
In fact, the Explorer launch is arguably our most complex one over the next 18 months, combining an all new high volume platform along with what is effectively a new factory and a new body shop.
We also launched our broadest ever Explorer lineup with both hybrid and ST performance models, and we're introducing a plug-in hybrid version of that Aviator.
Now, to achieve all this, we installed hundreds of robots, new technologies and moved out the scrap metal equivalent of the weight of the Eiffel Tower.
I'm pleased to say that the demand for this new products -- these two new products is strong.
We are selling these vehicles as fast as we can build them.
In fact, we are now expanding our capacity in Chicago.
So when you have a moment, do me a favor and click on the link on this page to watch a short video summarizing what it took to get our plant in Chicago ready for these key launches.
I think you'll be positively impressed.
Explorer, Police Interceptor and Aviator are just three examples of our dramatic shift in capital allocation to higher return trucks, utilities and crossovers.
At the same time, we are working to lower the capital intensity of our business.
Of course, we remain highly committed to quality and customer satisfaction in everything we do.
You can see that in the results from the most recent J.D.
Power US Initial Quality Study.
For the first time ever, both Ford and Lincoln ranked among the top five auto brands in the US.
I will expand a bit on our renaissance that is under way in Europe, where we made significant progress in the quarter.
In early January, our team in Europe unveiled a comprehensive roadmap to improve or exit less profitable vehicle lines, address underperforming parts of the business, and improve profitability through efficiencies and a significant reduction in structural costs.
In the first half of this year, our team did a tremendous job, achieving important milestones as they position the business in Europe for a 6% EBIT margin longer-term.
These milestones include, number one, a new operating model and organization, including three customer-focused business groups, each with a dedicated management team and bottom line accountability.
The first of the three groups is commercial vehicles, where we have reallocated resources to capitalize on our position as a top commercial vehicle brand in Europe, including leadership in the pickup segment.
Now, over the next five years, we're targeting to double our profitability in commercial vehicles.
The second group is passenger vehicles, which will focus on European built cars and SUVs.
Third group, well, this is imports, a niche portfolio of iconic passenger vehicles, including the Mustang and Explorer.
Importantly, we have largely concluded consultations with our social partners.
And in the UK and Germany, we have carried out separations.
In Russia, we have completed the restructuring of our JV there, which includes exiting passenger vehicles and Ford taking a minority stake and to improve manufacturing efficiencies we have proposed or confirmed the closure or sale of six assembly and component manufacturing plants in Europe by the end of 2020.
In the midst of this restructuring, we've also announced growth initiatives, including producing new all-electric vehicles and electrified options for all-new passenger vehicle models.
These new vehicles will support our compliance with the new European CO2 regulations, which we expect to achieve without having to buy credits or pay any kind of penalty, and our alliance with VW to support commercial vehicle and electric vehicle growth.
Now, if I can get you to turn to Slide 8.
Earlier, I mentioned the fourth strategic area that prepares Ford for this new era in our industry.
I refer to this as smart vehicles for a smart world.
Now this strategic area has benefited, as I expected, early from Jim Farley's mix of automotive and entrepreneurial history.
He appropriately focused early on the conclusion of the negotiations with VW to broaden our collaboration.
Now it's important to expand to you today why we're so enthusiastic about this news.
At a time when industry consolidation is daily making news, we believe we found a more thoughtful approach to collaborating in key strategic areas without adding the complexity of cross-ownership.
It started back in January, where Ford and VW announced a deal to develop commercial vans and medium-sized pickups for global markets.
This collaboration remains on course and we're excited about the potential.
Two weeks ago, VW CEO Herbert Diess and I said that our companies would expand this collaboration.
Now, this included VW joining us with an investment commitment to Argo AI.
This is one of the most capable autonomous vehicle platform developers, as you know, based in Pittsburgh.
The transaction with VW establishes an estimated value for Argo of more than $7 billion.
Collectively, we believe we're on a path to create one of the most important autonomous vehicle platforms in the industry.
Here's how our companies will work together going forward on autonomous.
First, we will collaborate with Argo on the self-driving system, known as the SDS.
That means that Ford and VW will be able to reduce our respective investments and development costs for the future AV businesses.
We will be able to co-create common AV standards, both now and in the future, and we'll share valuable data with Argo to help build the best visioning and mapping models along with data utilization analysis for traffic and fleet management.
Second, we'll share cost and expertise, so that we can each design and engineer unique, safe and efficient self-driving vehicles.
Third, Ford and VW, of course, will remain vigorous competitors and pursue independent go-to-market strategies using this common Argo SDS platform with each of us designing and delivering unique experiences for our customers.
In addition to our collaboration on autonomy, we also announced we are extending our alliance to electric vehicles.
Ford will become the first additional automaker to use VW's MEB, electric vehicle architecture.
We'll leverage this architecture for high volume zero emissions passenger vehicle in Europe and this is designed at our Ford Engineering Center in Cologne, Germany.
Ford of Europe will start building this vehicle in Ford facilities in 2023.
We're also considering a second electric model based on this MEB architecture for our Ford lineup in Europe.
This more expensive strategic relationship between Ford and VW is another important building block in the renaissance under way at Ford of Europe that I described earlier.
With that good news, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Stone.
Tim?
"
2698,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,1,"Good evening.
"
2699,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,2,"But, David, it's Jim.
I would just -- again in my tour, I just was there and I came away where Europe's performing in terms of this restructuring really well.
We've actually been speeding it up, so I want to make sure there's confidence that that work is happening and proceeding well.
"
2700,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,3,"Yup.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
Rod?
"
2701,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,4,"[Speech Overlap] Sorry, Rod, I just had to jump in here.
Just on the Europe piece specifically, there has been a significant number of announcements made this year and a lot of work by the team.
A lot of that cost comes out over the preceding quarters, because we just -- we announced the 12,000 salary and hourly [Phonetic] agency positions that are going to be gone by the end of '20, but a number of those are still to happen, so that savings isn't in yet.
And a lot of the plant restructurings, including some shift reduction and other things that we have going on, it doesn't happened yet.
So I think you will see this play out over the next several quarters.
Just a reminder though, as I said earlier, the third quarter in Europe typically is the lowest quarter, because of the shutdowns that we have in our plant.
So just want to remind everybody, we're making very good progress on the structural costs in Europe, but we do have some seasonality to keep in mind.
"
2702,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,5,"Yeah, sure.
We're very proud of the first half performance in our F-Series trucks, strong mix, as you noted, strong net pricing and really for the first six months of the year, very pleased with the results.
One thing we are seeing in the market is the market while down a little bit in the first half of the year on retail overall is up on commercial and that's actually helping on the F-Series side where we're so strong.
And you've just seen recent examples of how strong our truck products are in the marketplace.
I mean just today the J.D.
Power APEAL results came out.
In an unprecedented event, we won all three truck segments; Ranger, F-150 and Super Duty won their segments in APEAL.
And that's against newer trucks in the case of F-150.
So you can imagine how proud our team is of that.
We have the lowest incentive spending and the highest ADPs, you know this.
But our truck brands on F-Series continues to hold up very well and we're very pleased with the results and the truck market itself, well, incentives have been growing, we're watching it very carefully.
We’ll remain competitive, but we also watch very carefully and maintain our discipline as we always done, but actually you're seeing our business hold up pretty nicely with all of those considerations to take into account.
"
2703,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,6,"Yes.
I appreciate the challenge, but I want you to know we are planning to make it.

2706,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,9,"Yes.
So, it's Jim.
Colin, so the way we're monitoring this is we took on the structure, the management structure, what we call the bureaucracy.
So we had four key goals in that, I just report to everyone, we exceeded every one of them.
And that this quarter was heavier in terms of impact of the cost of that in the first -- there were more implications with people.
And then in the restructuring, Tim, I'll let you talk about the flows there.

It's Jim Hackett.
As I hand -- I'm going to hand this question to Tim, but I just want to tell the audience tonight that this is Tim's first call as our CFO and he has really done a great job of feathering into the Ford culture, bringing new perspective, new questions and he's become a great partner.
When we sat in front of you in January, I remember thinking about how we were going to help the Street see our year and sitting in front of us, from my perspective, as a CEO, was an open question about the tariffs, Joe can talk about the back and forth there.
We were working on our corporate redesign, this is the white-collar kind of effort the management reporting layers.
We had restructuring that you were just starting to learn about in Europe and we were actively working on our own recovery of China.
In fact, I just came back from there.
So from January to July, I just want to report to you, Emmanuel, as you look at those five issues, we've -- I'm really happy with the way the company's tackled each one of them and the progress we've made.
And you kind of teed up the good question and the right one I think about the second half of the year, which are these product launches.
So, tonight, I want to make sure that you see that this is a capability that we have to prove we're really good at.
I have a lot of confidence that we are and you'll hear that we've tackled the toughest one first in Explorer and Aviator.
But Tim maybe before Joe, if Joe wants to add color on the launches, you could just talk about the guidance and how we worked ourselves to that.
"
2710,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,13,"And I would just add, it's not something we talk about a lot from this table, but there was a lot of turmoil and turbulence in the leadership in China for Ford.
We had somebody that resigned for personal reasons, we replaced that, and then we had another change.
And so I want to tell you with my tour, that Joe and I, we really feel good about the management team that's in place there and a lot of momentum starting to build with them and because how long has Anning been there?
"
2711,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,14,"November.
"
2712,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,15,"Yeah.
So I just want to make sure that you guys hear that.
So, with the -- operator, I think it's time for us to wrap up.
If it's okay, I'll go ahead and close with a few thoughts.
I just want to say that our second quarter results demonstrate that this global redesign of Ford is driving positive shifts in our business and emphasize today that the news in Europe is better and the redesign that we took with the bureaucratic structure of the company is -- we met all the goals there.
So there is a lot of good news in this year of execution regarding that.
Thus, we are improving our fitness and that was a goal to make us more competitive.
We are driving a winning portfolio.
The logic, as you know, to move out of the sedans and the products like Ranger are paying off and we see ourselves fortifying strengths and improving mix and there's a really strong commitment as Adam asked us to expand that electric vehicle portfolio quickly.
And, lastly, the trajectory of the company is improving.
We believe -- and is strong in terms of growth, cash flow and profitability.
So, let me thank you for your attention this evening, and I'll turn it back to the operator.

So we'll come around...
"
2715,F,2019,2,james-p.-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,18,"Thanks.
Thanks, again.
Some of the launches we talked about are happening in Europe.
For example, the two-ton Transit and Escape/Kuga, many of these launches around the world.
But I just want to comment before we get too far down the path here that beyond the guidance that we provided for the EBIT range and EPS range and, most importantly, free cash flow, we aren't going to be giving any further details on the inputs that go into the final output.
So, for example, regional guidance or macro commentary or commodities exchange or tariffs and so forth, so I recognize that's a change, but we also changed by providing an EPS guidance range and a range for EBIT.
So I just want to comment on that in response to the question.
Joe, something else you wanted to add?

Can you hear me? Hello?
Operator
Yes, we can hear you.
"
2723,F,2021,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"OK.
Look, I wanted to just maybe get a little bit more clarification on the guidance.
I think everybody understands that the underlying guidance ex the semiconductor shortage impact isn't really changing.
And I don't think anyone would react to that at all.
If it wasn't for how surprisingly strong Q1 was.
You almost did 5 billion of EBIT, including the gain and 4 billion excluding it.
So the numbers obviously are going to be pretty low for the rest of the year.
I guess my questions on this are, was there, first of all, an unusual gain on incentives for inventory at dealers in Q1? Could Q2 actually be as low as Q2 of last year? And then even more importantly, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether we can extrapolate anything from these kinds of numbers that you did a double-digit margin in North America, 5% Europe looks like some pretty good warranty improvement.
So when the dust settles, what do you think we can pull out of this as we think about 2022?
"
2724,F,2021,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"Yeah.
Thanks for that.
Could you maybe -- just to ask this a different way, the 8 billion to 9 billion guidance, excluding the semiconductor impact that includes things like the inflation from commodities and so forth, it does include Rivian as well.
But maybe you could just speak to, at a high level, can we think about that $8 billion to $9 billion is kind of a launching point, if we wanted to think about bridging to next year, is that sort of the run rate of profitability for the business? And, you know, there's obviously adjustments in warranty and South America restructuring, new product, and things.
Maybe you could just speak to that and how we should be thinking about the run rate of profitability.
"
2725,F,2021,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,3,"OK.
And just lastly, it sounds like there's some permanency to this transition to the lean inventory sales model.
Could you speak to what kind of changes you're expecting here to distribution?

"
2727,F,2021,1,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,5,
2728,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn.
Hello, everyone.
Thanks so much for joining us today.
Our first quarter of the year really defies an easy explanation or a pithy soundbite.
But if I had to sum up one way, it would be this: we're executing on our plan.
And I'm excited to say Ford is becoming a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver under pressure, manage risks and seize opportunities all while generating consistent returns for our stakeholders.
In the quarter, we earned 4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT.
It's our best quarterly adjusted EBIT ever.
And we achieved these results in the midst of a persistent global pandemic, and an unprecedented supply shock tied to the global semiconductor shortage.
We mobilized the global team as we always do in these times of crisis.
And we rapidly adjusted to the realities that we were seeing.
Our team very skillfully navigated the supply constraints, through sharp yield management, and a relentless focus on turning around our automotive operations.
That means improving our launch performance, improving our quality, enhancing our brand, strengthening our customer relationships, and improving our go-to-market execution.
And Ford Credit, which in our view is the best automotive finance captive in the industry, also delivered an outstanding quarter.
Aided by higher prices, our results benefited from the industrywide imbalance of supply and demand given the semiconductor shortage.
However, we also delivered improvements that will persist over time, including our global redesign in our overseas operations, which contribute to the largest swing in year-over-year profitability for those operations that we've seen.
The benefit of our incredibly fresh portfolio refresh, which lowers the average showroom age now in the U.S.
to just three years.
And of course, we made progress on cost across the business.
As we share with you today, there are more white waters moments ahead for us that we have to navigate.
The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better.
In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year.
We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged.
Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves, enhances our cash flow, access to capital, gives us financial flexibility to modernize and disrupt our business while investing in growth.
We are very intentional about this because these are the catalyst factors that will transform Ford into a form of vibrant company that will deliver not only our iconic must-have products, but also -- and I would argue more importantly, and always on ever-improving customer experience for both our retail and commercial customers.
Let me share a few milestones from the quarter turning around auto.
Over the past four years, our overseas markets lost a total of 5.8 billion in EBIT.
This quarter the regions delivered roughly $500 million of EBIT, that's a $1 billion improvement year over year.
Let's look at those must-have services and products.
We'll start with the new F-150, which gained share and also gained share of revenue.
And it had new innovations like, which showed again, that we understand Ford customers afford these truck customers better than anyone.
And the Bronco Sport is off to a fast start bringing 60% new customers to our brand.
The new Mustang Mach-E is proving to be a hit with customers just a few days on lot with very strong demand in North America, now in Europe, and coming to China.
And it's also bringing in new customers to the brand almost 70%.
And we still have the big Bronco, the two- and the four-door with incredible order bank, the F-150 Electric and the E-Transit.
And we have some surprises for you as well.
Stay tuned.
Just as we are in the early stages of our electric vehicle plans, we're only scratching the surface of our customers benefiting from our fully connected vehicles.
We have successfully deployed our first major over their update software updates to hundreds of 1000s of customers, for Mach-E and F-150.
And this pace will only accelerate the next several years, making our vehicles better over time.
Later this year, for example, we will offer our very first fully tested Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving technology, which will be delivered over the air to Mustang E and F-150 customers.
And by 2028, we expect to have more than 33 million over the air updated capable vehicles on the road.
Now this install base gives Ford a significant opportunity to develop products.
And for us, very exciting new services that will transform the way we deliver products to our customers.
They'll make significant improvements to our customers experience and drive quality of our vehicles.
And we're on track to lead the electric revolution in areas of Ford strength.
For example, we announced we're investing 1 billion in the new electric vehicle manufacturing center in Germany, whereby 2023, just a few years from now, we'll be assembling our very first high-volume all-electric passenger car for Europe.
A year later in 2024, all Ford Europe commercial vehicles will be zero-emissions capable.
And by 2030, all Ford European passenger cars will be all electric.
Now, these investments are just part of our $22 billion commitment to lead the electric revolution in areas that we're strong.
And yesterday we announced a very important new development.
We have formed a new global battery center of excellence called Ford Ion Park, which will accelerate our research and development of battery, as well as, battery cell technology, including future battery manufacturing.
This only starts to hint at our electric vehicle ambitions.
There is so much more to come.
Now before I turn it over to John, let me share a bit more about where we and the industry are in semiconductors.
When we initially gave guidance in February, we expected that the semiconductor supply chains would remain constrained through the second quarter.
And we have an opportunity to begin recovering lost volumes in the second half is kind of played out similar to that with one big exception.
The industry faced another setback on March 19 when Renesas, a leading semiconductor supplier, who manufactures about two thirds of all chips in the auto industry experienced a significant fire at their Naka 3 facility.
Multiple Tier 1s who supply global OEMs sourced their chips from this facility, including nine Tier 1s who supply us at Ford.
Now Renesas expects it will return to full capacity in July, and they're making great progress.
While most of the chips for our modules for this facility are definitely dual sourced, Ford and others are facing additional constraints.
And we've yet to see significant new chip capacity come online for our industry.
Estimates project the full recovery of the auto chip supply will stretch into fourth quarter of this year and possibly even into 2022 making industry volume recovery in the second half of this year even more challenging.
As you can imagine, we are working this issue 24/7 and engaging with key political leaders and decision makers globally, as well as, of course our supply chain.
Ford relationship with the new Biden administration rests on our distinctive profile that we assemble more vehicles and have more U.S.
auto jobs than any other competitor.
It's also well recognized that Ford sided with California on greenhouse gas regulations when that wasn't the easy choice to make.
So from COVID, PPE to the current semiconductor crisis, to batteries for EVs, this past year has vividly spotlighted the importance of improving domestic supply chain for both our industry and our country.
Now we found the White House and the new cabinet engaging, accessible and responsive.
We look forward to continued close working relationship as the country formulates policies to facilitate the transformation from iced above and finally address infrastructure deficits.
As you would expect, we're committed to learn from this crisis to be a much stronger company.
We're taking this opportunity to revamp our supply chain to eliminate vulnerabilities down the road.
This is especially relevant as we consider not only semiconductors, but also battery cells and other commodities critical to our modernization and transformation.
We're also learning as we operate in this extraordinary low stock high demand environment in the U.S.
and around the world that we will see a leaner, more efficient company in the future, we're getting more fit.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John.
"
2729,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thanks, John.
Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate how proud I'm with this Ford team for its commitment to deliver on our plan, to fix automotive, to modernize the company, and to find ways to disrupt our business and the traditional auto industry to create value that will be rewarded -- that will reward our stakeholders.
On May 26, we will hold a virtual presentation for investment community where we plan to deep dive into our plan, as Lynn said.
We're going to cover how we're going to lead the electric vehicle revolution in areas that we're strong at Ford.
Number two, we're going to build out our industry-leading commercial vehicle business with products, but as well services that lead to growth and new revenue streams.
And we're going to leverage our connected vehicles to transform the customer experience and truly shift Ford from a more traditional OEM to a company where the manufacture and sale of the vehicle is just the very first step, and then ever-improving always on and far more rewarding customer experience.
I so look forward to speaking to all of you soon as we continue our effort to create a Ford that can compete and especially win in this exciting new era of our industry.
So with that, let's start the Q&A.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
All right.
[Operator instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
"
2730,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"We won't.
Hi, it's Jim.
I want to make it really clear, John.
That's not our intention.
We're a smart team, we're running our business responsibly, and there's real goodness here.
This is -- personally 10 years ago, I saw this industry go from 30-day supply way back up to 100 in 10 years.
We're not going to let that happen.
This is a better way to run our business, it's even more important now why? We get to move online.
We get to use a reservation system with customers for most customers when products are lean.
We can simplify our sentence, we have the most complicated go-to-market system, I think on planet Earth.
We could simplify all of that with tighter inventories.
And it's better for the fitness.
It also requires our industrial system to be more responsive.
So no, I want to make it extremely clear to everyone, we are going to run our business with a lower day supply than we have had in recent past because that's good for our company and good for customers.
"
2731,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Yeah, we had a billion-dollar swing year over year.
We've been at this for a long time in Europe.
We're entering a new phase in Europe.
So John, absolutely, the focus in Europe is in commercial vehicles and passion specialty passenger cars.
In international markets it's the Ranger and derivatives of the Ranger.
And in China, there's a-China like North America will have a more diverse product range than the other markets.
But let's be really clear, we're doubling down on our iconic nameplates and building out a family of products.
We just localized Explorer in China, it's doing great.
Lincoln is profitable in China.
I mean the growth rate in Lincoln in China and the profitability improvement as we localize to 90%, as John said, it's been very encouraging to us.
So in China and North America, we'll focus on these really passionate segments, where we think we naturally do well.
But the big change is not just improving the profitability by simplifying where we compete.
The big change in the company is going to be investing to an always on relationship with the customer.
That is the real change at Ford.
The change of simplifying our lineup and focusing on markets where we can be profitable is necessary.
It's the important foundation.
But what's sufficiency for us is to evolve into a different model with the customer.
And you'll hear more about that in Capital Markets Day.
"
2732,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Great question.
Thank you, Colin.
I would say it's difficult to make that judgment.
If you look into change of inventory, which is I think a great predictor of wholesale back in the quarter competitively.
I think, you know, most of the major brands were impacted almost equally.
So, you know, a lot of different news releases, a lot of different opaque data coming out.
I can understand why you asked a question.
We don't know yet, how this will play out competitively.
But we do know, the first quarter actually played out a lot more evenly than maybe even we thought.
As it goes on in the second half and into 2022, you know, we're starting to grow in confidence that we can support our recovery volume, we think it's prudent to have the 10% in our planning, but we are going to work very hard to make sure that doesn't happen.
It's just too early to tell.
The Renesas impact we think is going to be largely finished by the second quarter, if they execute, and they're just in the middle of that right now.
And so that kind of leads us back with the time when these foundries and how persistent that's going to be.
And right now, I just think it's a little too early to declare what that's going to look like.
But what we do know is the first quarter kind of turned out that most major players except for some of the companies who had buffer stock and saw this coming.
They weren't affected.
But I think Renesas now swept up almost everyone in the industry, just hard to tell how lumpy that's going to be across different brands.
"
2733,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Thank you so much for asking this question.
The answer is this is a very important announcement from Ford strategically.
In the first inning we could buy off the shelf and cherrypick the technology and energy density and the cost.
We've totally entered a different zone now, with our volumes -- planned volumes going up so much.
So we've already made the decision of vertically integrating the company.
We're now building motors e-axles now.
We've been writing our own battery management software for quite some time.
And now it's time for us to lock in on the latest technology and to have a secure cell production relationship.
There's no news to make today.
But the reason why that Ion Park announcement is so important is because it's our place where we will learn.
We will learn about with our partners how to transition to the very best in technology, energy density, the minerals, all the supply chain for batteries and cells, but also the manufacturability.
And ultimately, I think to be competitive in this industry, a major brand like Ford will have to vertically integrate all the way through the system.
It's just too early to make a bunch of announcements.
But this is our dream team, who will be -- who will be developing that capability in the company.
"
2734,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Thank you.
The answer is, yes.
We have learned a lot through this crisis that can be applied to many critical components.
That will be the essence of our new business, our modernized Ford, and it goes far beyond semi chips, there are other components that are really key enablers.
You know, it was very interesting for me, personally as the CEO, to talk to many of our colleagues in other industries and to find out how common buffer stocks are and how common direct buys are for the width of boundaries.
Even if the company still buys the components with the chips on them from a supplier, they still negotiated a direct deal.
These are all on the table of Ford right now, as you can imagine, yet we're also thinking about what this means for the world of batteries, and silicon, and all sorts of other components that are really mission critical for our company and our capability.
When I look at the company and what we need to vertically integrate, these are the areas.
These are the areas we're going to bet on moving inside the company for core competency.
And as we do that the supply chain becomes even more critical, but we also know more about it.
So thank you for the question and you can imagine everything is on the table like you mentioned, from buffer stocks to direct deals with the foundries.
"
2735,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"And Ryan just -- it's Jim.
Quickly, I'll be really quick.
You know, I've been in this business worked for different brands, I can't remember a time in my life, in my career, to have had so many hot products in one market like North America as Ford does right now.
I mean, Mach-E, sold out; Bronco Sport, sold out, F Series, sold out; Super Duty, sold out, we have a very -- our fresh new lineup is not only fresh, but it seems to be hitting the mark of the side case of the customer right now.
And, you know, I don't know where that's going to take us.
Yes, a really good question.
I don't know where that's going to take us.
But I do know it feels like we're going to be chasing demand for quite some time.
"
2736,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"You know, I would say, we're definitely feeling the commodity headwind, as John said.
And inflation, it feels like we're seeing inflation in various parts of our industry kind of in ways we haven't seen for many years.
On the other hand, it feels like it's all due to a lot of one-timers as the economy comes out of lockdown.
So I think it's a bit too early to declare the run rate, where it's going to be, it's just too hard to tell from my standpoint.
I will note though, based on your question that many of the vehicles that are supposedly aging at Ford or normally would be aging are still relatively new.
Super Duty is relatively new, Explorer is relatively new.
Yeah, Escape -- we have all the Lincoln lineup is brand new.
So normally we wouldn't have so much new at the same time.
And even the vehicles that are one or two years old are still relatively new in their segments.
"
2737,F,2021,1,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,
2738,F,2021,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
I just want to step back.
If we look at the semi-issue, do you think you're more impacted than the industry? We're just trying to understand if you lose 1.1 million, do you think you're able to recoup those in 2022? Or are other competitors maybe going to sweep in and take some of them because they have maybe a better supply chain? Just trying to understand if maybe you could kind of recoup that loss volume into next year?
"
2739,F,2021,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,1,"No, thank you.
That's a very helpful color.
Just more strategically, you made the announcement on Ion Park yesterday.
I mean, how should we be viewing this? I mean, is this an effort to make your own batteries? Or is this trying to build that expertise in-house so you could provide that to your battery partners? I'm not sure if we should read more than to that announcement.
"
2740,F,2021,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,2,"OK, thanks for taking my questions.
Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
"
2741,F,2021,1,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,3,
2742,F,2021,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good afternoon, everybody.
I just wanted to follow up on that line of reasoning.
I mean, you guys are kind of apologizing in some ways for the -- the good environment and what it's kind of forced you into in this lean inventory situation.
Obviously, let's forget about the second, third, and fourth quarter because they're going to be disrupted by the chip shortage.
But I mean, you're seeing and you saw us in the third quarter of last year, these incredible margins, particularly North America, and then with the international one second, but that's being positive.
I mean, you're kind of you're rolling off this list of things that have happened and that you may be able to maintain.
Why wouldn't you maintain them and maintain this supply demand balance or imbalance as you as you call it, but really some people might say it's a great balance, and really focus on, you know, the higher mix vehicles and drive similar performance? I mean, we just seen it happen third quarter, fourth quarter, there was some launch costs, but you saw it happen in the third quarter, you saw it happen in the first quarter.
I mean, why would it -- why would you let it reverse? I mean, and obviously, there's some industry dynamics that are -- other people are in the -- you know, other companies are in the same situation, but you yourselves are controlling this -- you know, can control this going forward on your product mix and what you do with your own production, and it's produced wonderful results.
I mean, why would you let it reverse?
"
2743,F,2021,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"OK.
And investors, too, which is important.
And I guess as you think about the experiment or not the experiment of what you're executing in South America of backing away and putting just a few vehicles-supply a few vehicles into that market, it seems like Europe and China are kind of heading in that same direction.
I mean, are you learning -- I mean, I know its early days in South America, from that business plan.
And I mean, and we're looking at Europe, that will be centered more around commercial vehicles, with maybe just a few easy passenger vehicles, and then China, which will be mostly Lincoln, and maybe some commercial vehicles.
And then IMG, which is the Transit and the Ranger and that's it.
And we'll see some stability in these international regions that hopefully will be profitable, but we won't always kind of be running around freaking out about whack a mole in one of the regions blowing upon us.
It just seems like you're getting a handle on South America, you getting handle on these other regions.
I mean, is this slimmed-down product offering and maybe smaller size with more stability and better profitability really the direction that you're heading in these international regions?
"
2744,F,2021,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"It's great.
And just quickly on FMCC, obviously, reserves are probably going to stay stronger this year.
I think you're probably being a little bit conservative there on your expectations.
But if you also once again think about this focus on mix and price and not over producing, the net beneficiary also is FMCC.
You mentioned the balance sheet being potentially a little bit smaller in the future as you can do more with less maybe everywhere.
What is FMCC going to look like, and I think we know, traditionally kind of think about $100 billion balance sheet.
But it sounds like it might be somewhat smaller and have better returns and maybe more stability in it.
You know, where are the net benefits in FMCC over time as the strategy emerges?
"
2745,F,2021,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,"OK, but could that be somewhat structural going forward? Or you really think this as transitory through the course of this year?
"
2746,F,2021,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,4,"OK, all right.
Thank you very much.

2747,F,2021,1,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,5,
2748,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thank you, Jim.
So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that's up about 33% versus 2019.
And that, of course, is all before the impact of global semiconductor shortage.
So our confidence in the stronger run rate is built on the durable changes that we've made to improve our returns, improve our cash flow and of course provides us financial flexibility to invest in growth.
And these improvements were embedded in our original 2021 outlook.
So for example, after shifting an overwhelming majority of our capital to our franchise strengths like trucks and utilities, we refreshed our product portfolio, we lowered our average showroom age and shifted our mix to our higher-margin vehicles.
And as a result, relative to 2019, the increase in our average transaction prices in the U.S.
was $1,900 more per unit than the industry average.
Now, also the tough choices we made to redesign our overseas businesses started to turn the tide.
Rationalizing manufacturing footprints, strengthening the product portfolios, focusing relentlessly on cost, and investing in areas of growth and strength are now producing results.
Another item we've also talked to you about is warranty.
Over the last three years, our warranty expense is increased by more than $2 billion.
Now, we've addressed this issue through changes in design, how we inspect vehicles, how we work with suppliers on quality, and now how we're using connected data to identify issues early in the process and drive quality improvements.
Now, this quarter, we delivered a $400 million improvement in warranty expense year over year, and we're intent on accelerating this positive progress.
So these are just a few -- three of the many examples of how the trajectory of our business is changing and what gave us the confidence when we set our original targets for 2021.
Now, let me turn to this quarter.
Wholesales declined 6% and in most cases that's due to the chip constraints.
Now despite the declines in wholesales, revenue grew 6% aided by higher net pricing and favorable mix.
We delivered 4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, and an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.3%.
And as expected, adjusted EBIT, including an investment gain of 900 million from a Rivian funding round that they had in January, so that was included as well.
And then adjusted free cash flow was negative 400 million.
The global semiconductor shortage reduced our planned Q1 volume by about 17% or 200,000 units.
And that's consistent with the 10% to 20% range of expected losses that we shared with you in February.
In Q1, we fully offset the EBIT impact of the loss volume, but we reduced incentives as part of the industrywide response to tight dealer inventories and that's especially in North America.
We optimized the mix of our production to build our higher-margin, higher-demand vehicles.
We also reduced our structural costs in areas including manufacturing and advertising.
We improved results in our FCSD parts business and in our joint ventures.
And we benefited from strong used vehicle prices in Ford Credit as customers and dealers drove up demand for used vehicles as new vehicle supply sell.
So some of these improvements, like the lower manufacturing costs and the robust pricing improvement, we do expect those to moderate as the industry returns to full production and dealer inventories rebound.
Now, our adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of negative 400 million was significantly lower than our 4.8 billion of adjusted EBIT.
Now, there's three main factors that contributed to this gap.
First, our gain on Rivian was noncash.
Second, in the quarter, we grew inventory by $2.2 billion.
Now, this includes parts for vehicles we could not build due to the lack of chips, but it also included approximately 22,000 vehicles.
Those are primarily in North America that are awaiting installation of chip-related components and so some of this inventory impact though was offset by a growth in payables.
And third is timing differences.
Now, this primarily relates to the reserves for customer allowances for incentives and warranty.
This reserve -- that reserve fell by $1.6 billion in the quarter.
The vehicle incentive portion is based on the number of vehicles awaiting sale and dealer inventory, and the expected incentive per unit and both of those fell in the quarter due to the supply disruption.
Now, we do expect that working capital and the timing differences to normalize as the semiconductor supply is restored, if dealer stocks rebound and incentives return to more normal levels, and we believe this process will take several quarters and will most likely extend into 2022.
Our strong balance sheet provides considerable flexibility to navigate times of stress such as this chip shortage while also investing in growth.
So we ended the quarter with over 31 billion of cash and 47 billion of liquidity, which includes our recent 2.3 billion convertible issuance.
We will continue to be very proactive in managing our capital structure.
Overall, our business units did a fantastic job prioritizing newly launched products, making sure that we process customer orders and high margin vehicles quickly.
And that was all in a supply constrained environment and the strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital for best, including investments to in source key elements of the value chain necessary for competitive and sustainable profitability.
So let me share a few of the highlights from the quarter.
In North America, wholesales declined 14% while revenue increased 5%.
Revenue was aided by strong net pricing and favorable mix, robust customer demand for our new product portfolio, tight industrywide inventories and favorable cost performance on a year-over-year basis and that included warranty.
All of that helped us deliver 2.9 billion of EBIT and a margin of 12.8% which was North America's highest margin in five years.
In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 70% and 40% respectively, and that reflects the exit of unprofitable products.
The renewed focus on strengths like Ranger, Transit and key imports drove our best quarterly EBIT since 2013 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement.
In Europe, wholesale declined 4% as revenue grew 13%, aided by improved product mix, led by our commercial vehicles and net pricing.
These actions together with our continued focus on cost delivered 341 million in EBIT with a margin of 4.8%.
In China, China delivered strong growth in both wholesale and revenue.
EBIT was about breakeven, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, supported by strength in Lincoln, Ford near-premium utilities and commercial vehicles.
In fact, Lincoln now produces 90% of its products locally, was profitable, posting its best-ever Q1 retail sales, nearly doubling its share on a year-over-year basis.
And commercial vehicle sales were also strong and now comprise 48% of Ford's total China sales.
In IMG, growth both wholesales revenue -- grew both wholesales and revenue as they focused on their franchise strengths of Ranger and Everest.
And IMG achieved its best quarterly EBIT, reflecting strong cost performance, net pricing, and favorable exchange.
All markets in IMG were profitable except for India.
And IMG also committed to invest 1 billion to expand Ranger capacity in our South Africa export hub to meet customer demand in more than 100 global markets.
In mobility, our AV business continues to invest in refining its go-to-market strategy.
It added a new 140,000 square foot command center in Miami and along with Argo AI is simulating ride-hail and delivery across six cities.
And I'd be remiss not to highlight the continued strength of our Ford Credit business, which delivered 1 billion in EBIT in the quarter.
Now turning to guidance, as we entered 2021, we were among the first to identify the potential for a 10% to 20% adverse impact in volume in the first half of the year, due to the growing chip constraints.
We said at that time that this risk had the potential to reduce our full-year adjusted EBIT by $1 billion to $2.5 billion.
That would take us off our original target of 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT.
We've updated our outlook to include the expanded impact of the global chip shortage, and that's largely driven by the Renesas fire.
While the situation is a significant headwind, we have definitive actions to address a full range of potential outcomes.
So we now expect to lose about 50% of our planned Q2 production, an increase from the 17% loss in Q1, making Q2 the trough for our performance this year.
Now, while we expect the flow of chips from Renesas to be restored in July, we and many in the industry now believe the global shortage may not be fully resolved until 2022.
So our outlook now assumes we lose roughly 10% of planned second-half production.
In total, we believe the shortage for the year will drive a loss of about 1.1 million wholesale units, which translates to about 2.5 billion EBIT.
That headwind -- and that headwind in EBIT is net of recovery actions for the year.
Now this EBIT impact was the high end of the range we gave in February, and brings our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance range to between 5.5 billion and 6.5 billion.
And it's very important to highlight that even though our expected volume loss for the year has more than doubled.
We have worked to contain the EBIT in back to the high end of our original range.
But we now also expect full-year adjusted free cash flow of 500 million to 1.5 billion, and this includes a 3 billion adverse impact from semiconductors.
The semiconductor impact on cash is 500 million worse than the impact on EBIT due to timing differences and the working capital impacts that will recover once a run rate of production is fully restored, dealer stocks return to more normal levels and incentives rebound.
Our Q2 free cash flow will be significantly negative.
And that's despite additional Ford Credit distributions driven by our adoption of the updated tax accounting standard, which reduces our tax allocation of Ford Credit and supports additional Ford Credit distributions.
However, we expect our cash and liquidity to remain healthy throughout the year, providing us with considerable flexibility to manage the present situation.
And this supports our growing confidence in the resilience of our business and our ability to effectively navigate the challenge just as we navigated the COVID related production disruptions last year.
So now I'd like to turn it back to Jim for a few comments about the Capital Markets Day.
"
2749,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
Hi, Rod.
Thanks.
That's a lot there.
Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question.
So as you said, the run rate to the business is 8 billion to 9 billion.
And without chips, we clearly believe that's, you know, where we would be.
And I think you're seeing come through the quarter a combination of things, as I said, in my remarks, you're seeing the strength of the underlying businesses improving and you're seeing that come through.
You saw that in the redesign of our overseas operations.
You saw that in warranty expense improving, right.
Those are two things that we said we needed to improve in our business.
As we move forward through the redesign, and you're seeing that come through.
You're also seeing the strength of our new products.
Now, it's a little opaque I think, for people to say, well, you also saw considerable pricing opportunity because of supply and demand imbalances.
That is true.
But so we go back and we look at what's happened with the pricing for our products since we started the redesign the refresh.
And that's where we come back to.
Since 2019, if you look at our price increases, our average transaction price increase, compared to what's happened in the industry, our transaction prices have increased $1900 more than the industry.
So that strength is flowing through.
Now we had additional pricing opportunity in Q1 due to the supply demand and -- supply and demand imbalance.
And so that hit the quarter as well.
We also saw a very strong mix in the quarter.
As we had lower production, so we optimized the production to our higher margin and higher mix vehicles.
So we saw that flow through as well.
So you're seeing that combination happen and impact as in Q1.
Now remember for the year as we go through the year, we're also going to see a significant headwind from commodities.
We saw very little commodity impact in Q1.
That's because we still had our contracts from last year in place and we had our hedging.
And so as we go through the year, we expect as contracts roll off, and we've seen the commodity prices increase primarily for aluminum, steel and in precious metals, we expect to see about a $2.5 billion increase in commodities Q2 through Q4.
So that's going to hit us as we go through the rest of the year.
We also won't have the nonrecurrence of the $900 million Rivian gain.
And we also expect that as we go through the quarter, and we get to more normalized levels of production albeit we said 10% lower in the second half, we should start to see more and a gradual normalization of those incentives that we experienced in the first quarter the benefit of that.
And then at Ford Credit, we did benefit again in the first quarter from the strong residual values and we do expect those to moderate as we go through the rest of the year.
So we've taken all that into account as we've gone through.
And I'd have to say that, what's encouraging to me and what the team has been able to do is we've been able to maintain the impact of the semiconductor chips to that high end of our range, the 2.5 billion, despite the volume impact growing significantly.
"
2750,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Absolutely, that is the run rate leading into next year.
And we still have new products Bronco, coming this year, the two and four-door, we have some surprises Jim talked about, we have the F-150 Electric, we have the Transit Electric.
So we have more products coming next year.
We're going to continue to be aggressive.
Our cost structure pushing that and the other thing that we're learning coming out of this situation that we're in is how do you operate in a lean environment? And we've learned some quite-quite a few good things about operating with leaner inventory.
So I think there's opportunities there, as well, as we head into '22.
So absolutely, the eight to nine is a launching pad, we see that as a launching pad into '22.
"
2751,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"So we've been doing quite a bit, of course, to get customers vehicles, to move people to more on order process, we've made changes to our processes to lower the gap between the time an order goes into the time we can deliver the order.
And we're also seeing that as we look at making these types of changes to modernizing or improving our processes in a lower inventory environment, you get benefits across the patch, right.
It would allow us to have lower capital required at Ford Credit, if we have to finance less dealer inventory for our dealers.
That could free up some capital to invest in other growth areas.
We would see better quality, because we'd have fresher vehicles and vehicles wouldn't be sitting on classes long.
We'd have improved dealer profitability, because they wouldn't be financing that floor plan and we'd have lower incentives.
We believe we'd have low incentives, because we'd have quick returning vehicles, and we'd have higher orders.
So as we're working through this lower inventory and these opportunities that we're seeing today, we're working on how we make them a normal part of our business as we go forward.
"
2752,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, that's-thanks, great question.
So it is similar to what we saw last year.
We're going to lose about 700,000 units, which said was 50%, roughly 50% of the planned production we had.
Maybe you look at second quarter of last year and it was very similar to that.
And I would say, as we got into this -- through the quarter, we have seen the team identify opportunities to offset more of the impact than we had originally thought.
That's why we're able to contain, you know, a much higher miss on the volumes within that original guidance.
And so the teams have been working extremely hard to bring the goodness that we're seeing in the core run rate of the business through and then to find other opportunities.
So absolutely, in both of those.
"
2753,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Thanks, Ryan.
So I think we have to go back and just ground ourselves again, in that run rate of the business of 8 billion to 9 billion.
And I don't want to get too far out ahead of ourselves on North America and what this quarter might mean for the run rate going forward.
Given as you said, there's just a lot of moving parts within this quarter.
I think the team's done a great job of managing through it.
We really saw the 8 billion to 9 billion as the run rate heading into '22.
We're going to do everything we can to continue to drive margin improvement, both here and overseas.
And the team is focused and Jim's pushing us really hard to continue to modernize and improve the business in every place that we can.
But as far as, you know, trying to predict coming out of this quarter what that means for the margin in North America, you know, in putting a number on the table, I'm not going to do that right now.
"
2754,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"So no, the quarter did not play out as we originally expected, right.
It came in much better, we did not expect that we would be able to more than offset all of the impact of the chips in the quarter, which was 17%, or about 200,000 units.
So we saw incredible opportunity there from the industrywide supply and demand imbalance.
So we saw pricing increase significantly.
We also then, because of the supply imbalance, we really pushed hard on mix.
So those were things that allowed us to improve the quarter.
We did not expect to use vehicle prices to increase 14% in the quarter.
And they did and that helped.
And that was part of what's happened with Ford Credit and the performance of Ford Credit.
And then as we go through the year, Emmanuel, one of the things that did not hit us in the first quarter that's going to hit us through the rest of the year is the commodity cost increases that come in quite significantly through Q2 to Q4.
So those are some of the things that are coming back and are going to come through in the second half of the year.
And then the other thing is as production normalizes a bit and supply and demand comes worn balance, we do expect that we should see some of this pricing that we saw in the first quarter moderate a bit.
And we should see some of that happen through the second quarter -- through the second half of the year.
"
2755,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"When we had first looked at it, we thought it was going to be significant, somewhere between 1.5 billion to 2 billion.
So it's slightly higher than where we had thought coming into the year.
"
2756,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yeah, so in Europe, this is the second strong quarter that Ford of Europe has printed for us.
And I think what you're seeing there is the redesign, you know, flowing through and showing up significantly again in this quarter.
And of course, the market was aided a bit by what we're seeing the dynamics in this quarter, but the fundamental underlying strength of the business in Europe has improved.
You know, we took over a billion dollars of structural costs out as we relooked at the footprint.
We've moved into commercial vehicles and improved our share there.
We have a higher mix of utilities.
All of that is providing a much stronger business for us in Europe.
And you've seen that two quarters in a row now.
Then when we look at South America, you know, we reduced our volumes significantly, and we improved our profitability.
And that just comes back to the point that we brought to the market and we are, and now we're going to focus on our higher-margin vehicle, a smaller footprint, a smaller business down there leaning into Ranger and Transit, which are good vehicles in the market.
And they're strong vehicles for us as a company and so you're starting to see that redesign really take hold.
"
2757,F,2021,1,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,9,
2758,F,2021,1,marion-harris,chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Hey, John, it's Marion.
I think you've covered a lot of it.
We do see used vehicle prices being stronger throughout this supply shock.
And so they're going to remain strong for quite some time, just as John said earlier.
And I think that's going to provide a lot of support for new vehicle pricing as well.
The 100 billion you mentioned is about size of the U.S.
balance sheet.
The Ford Credit in total is bearing that 130 billion this year.
So, you know, we're down quite a bit.
But it's all dealer floor plan, and so that's affecting -- that's a downside to our profitability, but on the other side of it, it's a strong used car prices.

2759,F,2021,1,marion-harris,chief-executive-officer,False,1,"At this stage, I'd say it's transitory.

2762,F,2021,1,lynn-antipas-tyson,director-of-investor-relations,False,1,
2763,F,2021,1,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
You know, obviously, a standout performance in North America despite downtime and costs associated with the F-150 launch and the semiconductor shortage and a lot of moving pieces with regard to the guide and the rest of the year with the changes impacting the chip issue and now the Renesas fire, et cetera.
So I thought maybe it would be great to just sort of zero in on your performance in the first quarter itself and get your thoughts on what a 12.3% North American margin in 1Q might imply for margin potential in a normalized environment.
Kind of looking at the historical cadence of North America margin over the past five years or the five years ended in 2019.
It seems like 1Q margin averages just about 40 BPS higher than the full-year amount.
And so maybe you're already operating in 1Q at almost a 12% kind of annual run rate.
And that's amid an F-150 launch and before any contributions from the Bronco.
So how would you rate the underlying performance in North America? And does that performance in 1Q suggest once all the supply chain dust settles a stronger than targeted 10% regional margin?
"
2764,F,2021,1,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,"OK, thanks.
"
2765,F,2021,1,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,2,"That's helpful color.
You know, let me ask just lastly, around the commodity inflation you're seeing and your ability to price for it.
You've called out to 2.5 billion headwind for the year, you did take 3 billion of price in 1Q, although I'm cognizant, there's a lot that goes into that calculation including relative to new launches, et cetera.
I think pricing is historically positive on launch models.
Thankfully, as you mentioned, you have a lot of those this year, but it tends to be negative for carryover models, and I'm just thinking back to like, 2011, 2012 kind of coming out of the financial crisis in '08, '09 after a lot of final assembly capacity have been taken out every call you and others reporting on the relative anomaly of positive pricing on even no carryover model.
So I'm just curious if we could see something similar now, say if the commodities headwind were to grow worse if the supply demand dynamic puts the industry in a position to pass really all the incremental costs on to the consumer or how do you see maybe the share of the burden taking place maybe the higher commodity is being -- the cost of it being shared between yourselves versus the consumer versus suppliers, dealer margin.
I don't know what you think.

2766,F,2021,1,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,3,"Very helpful.

Good afternoon, everyone.
Actually, I wanted to go back to something Rod brought up earlier.
I know you mentioned, you know, 700,000 units out in the second quarter.
Of course, we don't know what you were originally planning.
So is it likely the second quarter looks similar to the second quarter of last year? And somewhat related, you know, to your point, John, like the $2.5 billion headwind for the year is really just the high end of your prior range, but is the gross number higher? And that's been offset by other factors such as stronger pricing and maybe Ford Credit that bring it back down to that high end?
"
2769,F,2021,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"OK.
And then second question, you know, glad to hear the discussion about, you know, trying to keep dealer inventories more balanced.
I guess the other lesson that could be learned here, and I'm curious, you know, Jim, or [Inaudible] whether you have any preliminary thoughts is, do you just need to -- we've gone through a couple of this crisis, do you need to change how you think about, you know, assuring supply and -- of key components including chips, and -- or that sort of keeping more inventory historically, maybe it's, you know, more direct buy and not relying on Tier 1s? And if so, you know, maybe again, at a high level, how should we think about that practically working? Like, where in the value chain will that inventory be stored? And is that, you know, maybe a cost you're willing to incur for greater stability in the future?

2771,F,2021,1,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,3,
2772,F,2021,1,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,0,"So I'm still trying to better understand the $8 billion to $9 billion run rate, which is unchanged from your view earlier in the year.
So let me try and ask it this way, did the first-quarter earnings results play out as you had expected at the beginning of the year? And if it played out better, what are some of the expected offsets which are non-semi related that would prompt you to keep the same basis as the underlying profitability?
"
2773,F,2021,1,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"Is the commodities impact larger, much larger than you had thought originally?
"
2774,F,2021,1,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,2,"OK, and then a follow-up question.
I find very impressive some of the improvement that you're showing in the first quarter in terms of net pricing and cost in some of the international markets and, you know, showing some good traction with the fitness initiative.
I was hoping you could comment directly on Europe in particular around -- and South America around the sustainability of some of this performance that we're seeing? How much you think is sort of market-driven versus some of your own actions, both on the net pricing side, and also obviously on the cost side, the sustainability of those.

Hello, everyone.
Well, some may have described 2021 as a breakthrough year for Ford, I would simply portray it as a year of important progress for the company.
We strengthened our base business last year and now expect to deliver even stronger results this year.
And just as critical, we started moving with real speed and ambition to build a modern Ford.
Our true breakthroughs are still ahead of us, like rapidly scaling production of our popular new battery electric vehicles, like turning Ford Pro a new growth engine for our commercial customers businesses and ours, like building our intelligent software platform to revolutionize our customers' experience.
Even with the recent momentum, I know some observers may remain skeptical that a 118-year-old company like Ford will emerge as a winner in these disruptive times in our industry.
And I'm OK with that.
We're going to compete like a challenger, speak with our actions, prove ourselves over time.
So let's dive into last year.
As I mentioned, we have significantly improved our base business.
In North America, our largest market, we have a very hot portfolio of new vehicles.
We've now won awards of North America Truck and Utility of the Year for two years running.
That's never happened by any company.
The new Bronco, the Bronco Sport, the Maverick, the Mustang Mach-E, all of them, brand-new name plates for our lineup, all of them kits.
Last month, we launched E-Transit.
In the spring, we're in the middle of launching F-150 Lightning.
Few people ask us any more about why we phased out sedans, and many more asking when they could take delivery of the new Bronco or Maverick or Lightning.
So we're doing everything we can in our powers to increase our production and break constraints.
We don't like making our customers wait, and we're taking action to ensure that they don't pay unreasonable markups.
We've also made progress outside of North America, and this is very important.
Ford has been a one-legged stool for too long.
We stayed in Europe and South America and other regions because we really believe we can create sustainably strong businesses in those markets.
And we want to serve these customers with better, more connected and electric products and services.
The deep restructuring in Europe and South America have put us in a position to grow profitability going forward.
In China, we're now set up to play a much bigger role in the EV boom going on there.
We've quietly grown Lincoln into a strong contender in the world's largest luxury vehicle market.
In fact, China is now the No.
1 Lincoln market globally.
Our international markets group is profitable, and we're now preparing for the important launch of our next-generation Ranger pickup this year.
While we remain in the teeth of the COVID crisis and semiconductor shortages, our overall business is still in great shape.
And at the same time, we're rapidly making progress on key aspects of the Ford+ plan.
And for customers, that means more distinctive products and solutions, more always on relationships with our brands and adding ever-improving user experiences.
Now to deliver these things, we're building new muscles, and that certainly includes scaling up our production of electric vehicles, as I mentioned.
We under-called the demand for our first wave of EVs.
The Mustang Mach-E, the E-Transit, the F-150 Lightning.
In the past six months, we doubled our 2023 planned capacity for EVs to 600,000 units a year.
Now this required everything, from working with SK and LG to increase battery supplies to knocking down walls at our Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, while the mortar was still wet to make room to improve and build more Lightnings.
Our team knows how to scale manufacturing, and we're now harnessing that capability to ramp up production of EVs.
We also have a task force dedicated to lowering the bill of materials for our bets, above and beyond just the usual decline in material costs.
For example, on Mustang Mach-E, in just the last month, our team found $1,000 of opportunity per vehicle.
And that's delivered through design simplification, vertical integration and leveraging our scale with supply chain as we ramp up production.
And that team is just getting started.
We plan to take full advantage of our first-mover position in the fully electric pickup truck market, starting with Lightning.
But there's much more to come.
In the coming months, we'll break ground on the BlueOval City electric truck plant in Tennessee.
It will be the largest, the most advanced manufacturing complex in our history, and it will produce Ford's second generation of a full-sized electric pickup in high volumes starting in 2025.
And at the same time, we have three large-scale battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, which will be coming on stream with capacity to produce enough battery cells for more than 1 million vehicles a year.
This is in addition to our battery sourcing in China and Europe.
We are well on our way to achieve at least a 40% mix of BEVs by 2030, with strong margins and equal to our higher market share in the key high-profit, high-volume segments we compete.
For example, the F-150 Lightning, if we had full production today to meet our current demand, we would rival the Model Y as the leading BEV nameplate in the U.S.
market.
We can't grow a profitable BEV business without a very healthy ICE business.
And to do this, we're reducing complexity everywhere while increasing leveraging the benefits of our connectivity.
Now this includes things like fewer top hats guided by customer demand and a judicious approach to vehicle content based on deep insights generated from that same vehicle data.
We're also being disciplined with capital as we deploy that to our ICE products, recognizing that as a mix of BEVs increases, we will continue to manufacture ICE vehicles but with a focus on optimizing cash returns.
So our goal is to continue to improve our automotive EBIT margins.
Let me say that again.
Our goal is to continue to improve our auto EBIT margins even as we ramp up the mix of BEVs.
In 2021, we began to bring our vision of an always on experience for retail and commercial customers to life.
Our customers are realizing the benefits of our over-the-air software updates.
But that's just the beginning.
We're using our hubs in places like Palo Alto to attract more and more great software engineers and technology specialists.
And we're fundamentally changing the culture of engineering inside Ford.
The hardware will always be important, but the software and the embedded systems will define the next generation of our vehicles' experiences.
I think, customers will be amazed at the benefits as we move to central compute rather than the distributed compute we have across all the supplier-provided modules today.
Our human-centered interface professionals are now in one single organization, with authority over the in-car digital experiences, interfaces, screens and controls.
And we're committed to providing an environment where software engineers can do the very best work of their careers.
Before I turn it over to John, let me close, the velocity of change at Ford is increasing.
We're not seeking half measures.
Fear of change and risk has never served legacy automakers well in the past couple of decades.
We're done with incremental change.
We have a clear plan, a bias fraction and whatever-it-takes mindset.
We're confident our strong base business will generate the capital we need to fund a very exciting future.
We're recruiting incredible talent from outside the company to work with the best people from Ford.
As excited as our customers are for that great portfolio we have in the market today, we can't wait to show them what's coming in the future.
Now I'll turn it over to John who will take you through the results for the quarter and our expectations for this year.
"
2778,F,2021,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thanks, John.
Yeah, I don't want to speculate on rumors or speculate on the speculation in the press.
But I will go back to something we said and I've said over and over again, which is running a successful ICE business and the successful BEV business are not the same.
The customers are different.
We think the go-to-market is going to have to be different.
The product development process and the kinds of products we develop are different.
The procurement supply chain are all different.
The talent is different.
The level of in-sourcing is different.
And actually, the rhythm of the business is different, fundamentally different.
So I'm not going to talk about speculation in the press, but I will tell you that the way we're operating the businesses acknowledges those differences.
And I'm really excited about the company's commitment to operate the businesses as they should be.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
"
2779,F,2021,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Thank you for your question.
Perhaps the biggest gift for all the pain we're going through now in semiconductors is that we have very painfully learned the lesson that we cannot manage the supply chain for these key components as we have.
In fact, you could argue that in the change of transition to these digital electric vehicles that supply chain could be one of the biggest advantages a particular company has or doesn't have.
The way we look at it is the key electric components, memory chips, semiconductors.
I would break semiconductors into two types.
I'll come back with GlobalFoundries in a second.
Feature-rich chips that we still use a lot.
A window regulator doesn't need to have a 4-nanometer chip.
And the advance -- but we also have sensors, power electronics for our inverters, the batteries themselves all the way back to the mine, the inverters of different battery.
Chemistries itself have different raw materials and kind of ecosystems that support them.
So this is a very important topic for the company.
How different it is? It's really different.
We need different talent at the company.
We need physical inspection of the actual producers.
We need direct contracts with them.
We need to design the SoC ourselves.
We need to direct in the case -- in some cases, to even direct prefer build to print or actually use supplier XYZ to get out of where we've been.
And this takes talent.
It takes a different approach.
It takes more resources.
On GlobalFoundries, it's kind of the first big bet, but there'll be many, many more coming for us.
We're very dependent on TSMC for our feature-rich nodes.
Obviously, the capacity is at risk over time as the industry moves to more advanced nodes, including us.
And as I said, we're going to need feature-rich nodes for many years to come.
GlobalFoundries knows how to build them.
They know to build them in the United States.
We can partner with the government, depending on the CHIPS Act to capacitize here.
It will be a few years until we benefit from that, but it's a really big thing to descale ourselves on the feature-rich chips from the current ecosystem that we depend on around the world.
And I think, GlobalFoundries is a really interesting deal when we get into the details.
We have to put cash up when we participate.
Those feature-rich semis will be used by other companies, industrial companies, not just Ford.
It's a really interesting deal.
And I was talking to the U.S.
government today about how critical this is for our company.
You can expect the same kind of thing on advanced nodes and all the other components I mentioned, including more deals on the raw material for various types of battery chemistry.
And this is a culture change at Ford.
As I said, this is part of the rhythm change between ICE and BEV.

Morgan. 
"
2780,F,2021,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Sorry, what's nice about what we're seeing this year or our forecast this year is we're seeing good profit leverage from that incremental top line.
And I think, that's very encouraging.
We have lost statistics about how that compares in the past, but that hasn't always been the case at Ford.
It's great to see that top-line flow into our profitability increase.

And our next question is going to come from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. 
"
2781,F,2021,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Thank you.
I would say the answer to your question for ICE and BEV would be slightly different.
We have about 10% of our dealers last year in the supply constrained environment that we're charging above MSRP to our best of our knowledge.
We have very good knowledge of who they are.
And their future allocation of product will be directly impacted because of that policy.
And we've seen really quick action by our team.
On the BEV side, this is quite an important topic because the margins that we want to build to in BEV are gonna be heavily dependent on a different go-to-market and customer experience.
I won't go into any more than that, but this is a quite important lesson for us of the franchise system and the way we will manage going forward.
But I'm very optimistic now that our team has the intelligence in the market that we put an allocation trigger in for those dealers who choose to price that way.
But it's inefficiency, no doubt about it.

Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. 
"
2782,F,2021,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Thank you.
So we've been hard at work at this for quite some time, actually.
We knew we were oversubscribed pretty early in the process, and the team has been at it.
We have been working.
Really, the primary lift for us is battery availability.
So we've actually been securing extra batteries for quite some time now.
We have some manning options for Mach-E.
So we will move close to 100,000 units this year on Mach-E.
That will be our big move this year.
Next year, our big move will be Lightning going to 150,000 units.
I won't get into battery chemistries and all the details, but I'm really excited about the progress we've made so far in securing batteries.
On the F-150 Lightning, we actually had a physical capacity constraint of the facility.
And so, we took the decision already to again redesign the facility so that we can accommodate the 150,000 units.
We have great capacity on F-150 for the nonelectric components.
So this is just a matter of the Mach-E getting the labor in place and getting the batteries and the F-150 getting the batteries out of Georgia and redesigning the facility so we can get the final assembly done.
As far as chips are concerned, these battery electric vehicles and the supply chain are a strategic advantage for our company.
So we will protect in the constraint where we will protect our battery electric supply production. 
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. 
"
2783,F,2021,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Absolutely.
Absolutely.
The profitability of ICE is very important because it gives us optionality, not only of scaling BEV, but also vertically integrating BEV, which is increasingly becoming important for a profit lever.
So we definitely want to push our ICE business as fast as far as we can.
We're going into this transition with the freshest ICE lineup I can think of any of our competitors, not just in the U.S.
globally.
But we think there's, as John said, a ton of other levers that we can pull to improve the margins of our ICE business.
We see our ICE business increasingly in kind of specialty groupings of passion brands like Bronco and Mustang.
And our pickup truck customers retail side using those for recreation and for everything they use them for.
And so, look at the success of Maverick we've had, for example.
So we're really excited about this opportunity for BEV.
And you bet you, it gives us all sorts of optionality as a company to really continue to invest in high growth business, but also focus -- allow us to focus our cash and our investment in building the margin for the high growth business through things like vertical integration and new customer experiences, accelerating our physical experiences to the dealers on both businesses. 
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question is going to come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.
"
2784,F,2021,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Just to complement John's input.
I'm struck throughout my career, I'm struck at how different the rhythm of this digital BEV businesses versus ICE.
We all grew up in a business where you kind of launched the vehicle and then you work on a minor change or a next model.
I certainly grew up in that model.
And what we're finding with ICE, thank goodness, we're scaling now because what we're finding in Mach-E is that actually, most of the exciting work starts after Job 1.
That's when the OTAs really make a customer impact.
But on the cost side and the profit side, I guess, we have learned so much about the lack of integration in our engineering operations as we compared our engineering on Mach-E to others that are best-in-class.
And we are finding lots of profit opportunities as we get after that integration between engineering, supply chain and manufacturing, even within engineering.
If I showed you our cooling system for Mach-E, it has four motors, probably needs to be two.
It has 60 or 70 hoses, probably needs to be one-third of that.
And those are the opportunities we're going after.
And we are not going to wait for next year.
We're not going to wait for a minor change.
We are going to reengineer that vehicle now and then use that expertise for Lightning, E-Transit and, of course, our all electric platforms.
And I just, I'm really excited about this opportunity.
Being in the industry as long as I have, I haven't felt this chance to take out so much cost after Job 1, both from the customers' use of the vehicle off the data, as well as actually all these integration opportunities.
And the other thing is the vehicles are much more simple than we thought.
The F-150 has one cab, one box.
And we -- for the same kind of ICE offering, it's like 40 configurations.
So they're much simpler.
And I'm really excited about -- I guess, what I'm saying is we're at the very beginning of this journey.
And it's already very exciting on the profit improvement, as John said.
And I haven't seen this kind of opportunity in the past in my career.

Just following up on the walk.
If I actually annualize Q4, you're running at only $8 billion.

Just a first question.
Jim, there's been a lot of speculation that you might consider spinning a portion of the future car business, whether it be EV or AV with Argo.
But there's also the backside of that that might make more sense to spin some of your legacy ICE assets and have the entire company become a more pure-play EV/AV company in totality.
So I mean, how do you think about this? And what would you be your motivations either way? And how you -- I mean, how are you strategizing this?

In the face of ongoing challenges with semiconductor constraints and industrywide supply chain disruptions, we executed our Ford+ plan, including closing out our global redesign, strengthening our product portfolio and investing in exciting new opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation.
For the year, we posted $10 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 7.3%.
That's our strongest performance since 2016.
We delivered right at the midpoint of our guidance range, adjusting for the reclass of our first quarter Rivian game to a special item.
And despite a 6% decline in wholesale, our automotive business posted its strongest EBIT margin since 2016.
North America delivered an 8.4% EBIT margin and is firmly on the glide path to a 10% EBIT margin.
In addition, our operations outside the U.S.
collectively posted their best results since 2017.
I'm very proud of the team's hard work, the resiliency last year as we rose to the challenge and optimized constrained production to protect customer orders, new launches, our electrification strategy and our most profitable vehicles.
We also remain highly disciplined with our incentive spend and mix management, which, combined with improvement in warranty costs, more than offset commodity headwinds and supply chain-related production losses.
Ford Credit, whose profits and dividends are an important source of capital for us, delivered a strong year.
EBT was $4.7 billion as auction values were at record highs and credit losses were near record lows.
Free cash flow was $4.6 billion, and we ended the year with strong cash and liquidity, more than $36 billion and $52 billion, respectively, which now includes our stake in Rivian valued at $10.6 billion at the end of the year.
In 2021, we continue to advance our capital strategy given the improvements we're seeing in the underlying business.
We reinstated the regular dividend at $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders.
We also further strengthened our balance sheet by repurchasing $7.6 billion of high-cost debt, deleveraging the balance sheet and significantly reducing our ongoing interest expense.
We introduced the industry's first fully integrated sustainable financing framework, covering both an auto OEM and its captive finance company.
And in November, following the launch of the framework, we completed our inaugural $2.5 billion green bond issuance, which was met with incredible investor demand and will help fund our exciting BEV portfolio.
Our strong balance sheet, including cash, provides a solid foundation to continue to invest in our Ford+ priorities.
So let me briefly touch on the fourth quarter.
With a margin of 5.4%, adjusted EBIT was $2 billion, and we generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow.
Some modeled stronger EBIT for us in this quarter.
We know that was largely driven by higher volume expectations relative to the 10% sequential increase we guided to in October and lower corporate other expenses.
North America delivered $1.8 billion of profit with a margin of 7.1%.
Volume was up 10% on a sequential basis as supply chain constraints eased and custom demand for our products remained strong.
South America delivered a modest profit for the second consecutive quarter, and the business is now set up to deliver sustainable profitability.
With restructuring of the legacy business complete, the region is now focused on strengthening Ford's position in the truck market, growing its new commercial vehicle business and enriching customer experiences.
In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to accelerate toward a 6% EBIT margin.
However, the adverse effect of near-term supply chain disruption continues to mask that improvement.
Importantly, we were the No.
1 commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the seventh consecutive year, and transit continues to have an extremely healthy order bank.
Mustang Mach-E sales in the region are off to a strong start, with the order bank building momentum as we accelerate the transition to BEV.
In China, Lincoln continues to be a real bright spot and gain share in the highly profitable and growing premium segment.
In the fourth quarter, we achieved record sales of the brand in China, contributing to an almost 50% increase for the year.
We are expanding the Lincoln portfolio in 2022 with the launch of the all-new Zephyr.
The order bank for that vehicle opened recently and is off to a fast start.
In the fourth quarter, we also achieved an important electrification milestone in China as we began local production and customer deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E.
Our direct-to-customer model for Mach-E allows people to order online and through 25 Ford select city stores.
Our international markets group performed well in the fourth quarter and had a record year playing to its strengths, especially from our flagship Ranger pickup, which delivered full year segment share of 14.9%, up 1.1 percentage points year over year.
We also announced major investments in both South Africa and Thailand to modernize production and launch the next-generation Ranger from four assembly plants later this year.
And in mobility, we've made steady progress toward the scaled commercialization of moving people and moving goods, and we are confident in Argo's progress in delivering a Level 4 autonomous vehicle solution.
And in addition, we are rationalizing our investment portfolio and focusing on autonomous development.
Now I'll share with you our current thinking about 2022.
We expect supply constraints to remain fluid throughout the year, reflecting a variety of factors, including semiconductors and COVID.
Based on what we see now, we believe our full year wholesales will be up about 10% to 15% in 2022, with a high single to low digit decline in the first quarter, reflecting supplier shortages related to Omicron shutdown and semiconductors.
For the full year, we expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that's up 15% to 25% versus 2021.
And the high end of the range equates to an adjusted company EBIT margin of 8% and our North America business at 10% EBIT margin, which, if we achieve, would be one year earlier than the target we shared with you last May.
Now turning to GAAP results for a minute.
It's important to point out that each quarter, we will mark-to-market our investment in Rivian, which sits in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet.
This is not something we can forecast.
The mark-to-market may cause volatility in our quarterly GAAP, net income and EPS results.
So looking at how our adjusted EBIT guidance rolls up.
Our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collected profitability outside of North America as we realize the full benefits of our global redesign efforts.
We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong but lower than 2021 profits, and we expect mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat.
Lastly, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion.
Now other assumptions we factored into our guidance include: first, we expect customer demand enthusiasm to remain strong for our new and iconic nameplates.
We will have a full year of production of the award-winning Bronco and Maverick in addition to a robust BEV lineup with Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning, all in production.
Second, with wholesales up about 10% to 15%, we anticipate the pricing environment to remain strong, although the interplay between volume and pricing will remain dynamic.
Third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures, which will impact a broad range of costs.
And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong in 2022 as supply constraints persist.
However, as I mentioned, we anticipate lower EBT reflecting primarily nonrecurrence of reserve releases, fewer returned off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.
Most importantly, we're committed to our Ford+ plan, and we'll continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation.
This includes devoting resources to customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification.
We are confident the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial.
So that wraps up our prepared remarks.
We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your mind.

Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you.
[Operator instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.
"
2792,F,2021,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah, hi, Rod, it's John.
So I guess, I would say that, as Jim just said, that we're looking at the ICE business and the BEV business, and we're managing both differently.
When you look at the ICE transition, I think there are still a lot of opportunities for us to improve that business.
We're very focused on reducing our structural costs.
We've done a lot already, but there's a lot more that we think we can do there.
We're looking at operating with much lower stock levels as our business continues to develop.
So we'll operate at leaner inventories than we have in the past, which will help our top line, and continue to strengthen that top line.
We're improving our quality, which is important.
We saw that come through this year from a year-over-year warranty standpoint was down roughly $1.4 billion.
And we want to be at the top in quality in every segment, and that's going to have opportunity for the business.
We're also working to revitalize our business through our digital capabilities, leveraging what we have from the connected vehicle to improve warranty even further, as well as improve what we're doing from a manufacturing standpoint and leverage that technology to bring those types of cost down.
There's opportunities in maximizing our parts business, and we're going to lower our distribution costs.
There's opportunity there.
So we see that over time, as we manage the ICE business, there's opportunity to improve margins even further from there.
And then, when you talk about BEV, so as we've talked about in past calls, our BEV margins are not where we intend it to be.
We have opportunity, but we need to do that through scaling them, right? We're not going to chase top hats.
We're going to look at scale.
We're going to want to have a strong lineup where we can lean into it with key vehicles in high-volume segments like we are today with Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and in our commercial vehicles with the Transit.
We're going to reduce complexity, right? We know that one of the things that we need to do on our vehicles, and we saw that, as Jim talked about, with the team finding $1,000 a unit on Mach-E, and they just got started is that we need to approach the design of these vehicles differently.
And that's what's really important about having the first-mover advantage there.
We're on the road with these.
We're in production with these.
We understand what we need to do in that second generation, and we're off doing that right now, improving what we have on the road today and really bringing that knowledge into our second-generation design.
And then, as I said earlier, on the ICE business, we're going to leverage the compute on the vehicles to really lower our manufacturing costs and leverage that compute to simplify what we do coming down the line and bring that down to the bottom line of the vehicle and then distribution.
We all know the difference in the distribution cost for the legacy system that's out there versus what we see with other manufacturers.
So that's an opportunity for us to work with our partners to improve that.
So on both of those, we see opportunities.
And then, as you said, Rod, there's opportunities to grow our business and lean into our leading position in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro.
And we're looking to grow that business to $45 billion in revenues by 2025.
And so, I think there's opportunities across both of our key segments and with Ford Pro to improve the business as we move forward beyond the 8%.
And now, we need to stay extremely focused and relentless on that execution.
Operator
Thank you.
And our next question is going to come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
"
2793,F,2021,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Thanks, Ryan.
So yeah, we're really pleased with the position we have from a cash standpoint because it gives us the flexibility to invest in the business as we go.
We've talked about the investments we'll be making in BEVs.
We'll be breaking capacity constraints, and we're going to continue to focus on scaling as quickly as we can.
The other thing we need to think about is the supply chain for our BEVs.
There's opportunities potentially for vertical integration.
There's opportunities for looking beyond as we move into these connected vehicles with more advanced electronics, potentially leveraging capital to secure supply chain there.
So there's a lot of opportunities as we move forward to leverage this cash to improve the business.
We're also focused on our shareholders.
And of course, total shareholder returns is important as well.
So we're going to continue to provide dividends to our consumers -- to our shareholders, which is important for us as we move forward given our shareholder base.
So I think, what you'll see is that that cash balance is gonna be a benefit for us as we look to grow the business, as we look to expand, as we look to vertically integrate, as we look to secure our supply chain and we continue to develop our Ford+ plan. 
"
2794,F,2021,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"So let me focus on 2022 first.
So looking at the walk for 2022, you have to think about the 10% to 15% in the volume growth, but mix is also a strong part of that on a year-over-year basis.
We expect to see continued strong mix.
Pricing, as I said in my remarks, we do expect the continued strong pricing environment.
So when you look at volume, mix and pricing, we expect that to be up about $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion.
And so, I'll just walk through what -- where we see that on the bridge to 2022.
We are continuing to invest in modernization, and that was along with our product related spending as we're continuing to build out our BEV business.
That's about $1.5 billion headwind, but that's broadly offset with other efficiencies that we're working on.
You also see that commodities are gonna be a headwind next year of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
And then, Ford Credit is gonna be strong, but we do expect them to be down about $1.5 billion.
And then, of course, we've got lower net pension income.
So we expect the top line to be strong with the volume increase.
We continue to expect to have strong mix.
And then, we expect pricing to be a strength as well on a year-over-year basis. 
Operator
All right.
And our next --
"
2795,F,2021,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"From a quarter-over-quarter basis and what -- how the quarter developed, we hit the midpoint of the guidance.
And one of the things is, I think, some expected volumes to be up higher than what we had guided.
And just we had supply chain constraints hitting us this quarter.
Omicron disrupted several of our key suppliers.
They couldn't produce.
They couldn't get us products.
But net-net, when you look at the fourth quarter relative to where we were third quarter, let's say, as a proxy, volume and mix was up slightly.
It was up about six-tenths.
But then we had additional headwinds on commodities.
We had some modernization costs that came through, specifically around our IT, as well as connectivity as we're investing in those growth areas.
And then, we saw costs come through from inflation.
We saw costs come through on transportation, on fuel, etc.
So we're seeing some of those headwinds were hitting us in the fourth quarter.
But demand was strong.
If we could have met the demand and the production without the disruptions, you would have seen a stronger quarter.
And so, as we go into 2022, as we see those supply constraints ease, as we see the demand for our really strong product lineup, we see the top line growing.
We see continued improvement in mix.
We see continued improvement in price.
And that's gonna be much more of a tailwind versus some of the headwinds we're seeing that --[Audio gap] 
"
2796,F,2021,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"No.
I don't think that as we ramp up at the start with the launch this year that it's going to have a significant impact on what we see from a standpoint of our profits in North America.
And then, coming back, I think one of the questions, Colin, you had asked that I didn't touch upon was the fourth quarter or maybe it was Emmanuel earlier, on the mix side is we did have lower Super Duty mix in the quarter, and that was, again, driven by supply chain disruptions.
There were vehicles that we weren't able to build and complete because of certain commodities that weren't coming through to get those vehicles down the line and done. 
Operator
Our next question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays. 
"
2797,F,2021,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yeah, thanks.
It's John here.
So when we look at our Mach-E profitability, as we said, we are profitable from a Mach-E standpoint.
We're seeing great demand.
We're seeing strong mix.
So we've seen the profits improve.
Importantly, what else we're seeing is opportunities to continue to reduce the cost and reduce the complexity.
So we're very focused on improving those margins.
But overall, as we said in the past, our fab margins are not yet quite where we like them to be, especially relative to our more profitable ICE vehicles.
And so, we have to continue to do work there, primarily around scaling, reducing the complexity as we move forward.
So we're encouraged by what we're seeing on Mach-E so far, especially with the strong demand and the mix, but there's other work that we need to do as well to continue to further improve those margins.
And our expectation is that we're fully competitive on our BEV margins as we move forward, and that's what we need to work toward.
"
2798,F,2021,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"In Europe, we expect profit improvement.
We expect them to be meaningfully profitable in this year in 2022.
And we're still committed, and Europe is on track to deliver the 6% EBIT margin by 2023.
They're continuing to move forward.
They're seeing favorable pricing environment continue.
They're accelerating into the BEV.
The Mach-E is a very strong product for them.
And again, commercial vehicles, it's a strength of ours, and we continue to see that grow next year and be a pillar for Europe, a strength for Europe.
With IMG, as you go into 2022, International Markets Group, we expect them to be down year over year, but profitable.
And that's gonna be driven by two key things: the India transition and what we see there, as well as the fact that our Ranger volumes are gonna be down year over year as we launch the new Ranger.
And so, it's a transition year for us in the International Markets Group.
So they'll be down year over year but profitable.
And then, from there with the new Ranger, we're really excited about that product and what we can leverage with that product as we move forward in our International Markets Group.

Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
I'd like to ask about your JV with GlobalFoundries and just broadly about what you're trying to do with electronic components and sort of the notion of simplification, which you've talked more about.
So we've heard that with GlobalFoundries, I think Hau Thai-Tang mentioned you'd like to control more of the sub-sourcing to suppliers.
You'd like to dictate more of the design of some of the electronic products that in the past have been handled by the suppliers.
Maybe you could help us unpack this.
How significant of a change is this in your operating model where you frankly focused on just the core vehicle itself and outsourcing where you can? How achievable is this, especially given you're concurrently undergoing this transition to EV? And broadly, how should we think of the financial implications given you're going from what's been more of a just-in-time approach on inventory and components to now more of a just in case and deeper in the supply chain? Thank you.

Good evening, everybody.
I was hoping to go back and get an update on Mach-E profitability.
I think, a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned you were already positive EBIT.
It seems like pricing has been really strong in the last few quarters.
You talked about taking out maybe $1,000 of cost going forward.
And of course, you're cutting up volume.
I was hoping maybe you could give an update on kind of where you see Mach-E profitability this year versus your original expectation that maybe even relative to ICE vehicles, perhaps like the Edge.

Thanks for squeezing me in.
I just wanted to go back to the regional discussion as we think about the thoughts you shared on margins in North America that are embedded in the upper end of the full year '22 EBIT guide.
I wonder if you could just give us a sense for how you're thinking about the trajectory of margin improvement in Europe and IMG specifically.
Just thinking about the semiconductor shortfall evolving over time, the focus on Ford Pro and new product launches potentially helping to accelerate some margin recovery in Europe and then the continued focus on Ranger and new products in IMG.

I want to talk a little bit about dealer pricing versus your pricing.
The Detroit Press ran some articles in January on taking action in some of the more egregious markups on EV.
Yet, if I look at the broader lineup, I see that per J.D.
Power, your revenue per unit is up about $3,800, which clips to your $7.6 billion pricing you cited.
Yet the transaction prices are up 5,600, meaning you're leaving about $1,850 of profit in the dealers' hands, which would be about another $3.6 billion of profit.
So just wondering kind of as you kind of go forward, as the dealers, especially move to this simplified inventory model you're looking at, how you're thinking about the balance between your invoice, your revenue per vehicle and the actual transaction prices at the dealer level?

2810,F,2021,4,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Hi, thanks for taking my question.
Slide 20 shows you with $36.5 billion of cash and investments, which might be a record, but it is certainly the most that I can remember and compares to, I think, like five-plus years ago, you used to talk about wanting to have cash of something closer to in excess of $20 billion with like another $10 billion or $13 billion of more liquidity on top of that.
I get that there's more uncertainty now with the pandemic and the chip shortage.
And of course, you're investing heavily for electrification.
Despite those investments, though, I mean, you're still calling for $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion of FCF this year versus the dividend costs like $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion.
So with the current trajectory, it seems like the record cash pile should only grow bigger in 2022.
I'm just curious what your thoughts are on this, whether you have any updated thoughts on the optimal capital structure, over what time or under what conditions you might move toward that more optimal capital structure.
And it being so far above the earlier targeted cash balance might influence how you go about deciding what to do with the Rivian stake once the lockup expires.

I wanted to ask you a little bit about margins.
As John said, it looks like you guys will hit 8% if you hit the high end of your target range.
And Jim, you said that you're targeting improving margins from here.
So maybe you can give us a little bit more color on that, how we should think about it? I'm not sure that 8% is the benchmark anymore just given how many years ago that's been and how many changes there are to the business.
You're ramping up a lot of spending on engineering and spending up in EV infrastructure, but you're also going to grow the Ford Pro business.
So maybe you can just give us some of the puts and takes, how to think about it? And as part of it, if you might just give us a data point on where Ford Pro stood in 2021.

Jim, it's really refreshing to hear you talk about the two different businesses and how you're managing them and running them and planning for them separately.
I guess, so to the -- and it's also good to hear you think you would have more to wring out of the ICE business.
But I guess, the question is, as CEO of Ford, which is managing those two businesses, like, to the extent you are able to wring more out of ICE, does that give you leeway to accelerate or increase your investment in the EV business? Like how do you think about combining the two businesses back together in terms of the investment spend?

Good evening.
I wanted to ask you a little bit more detail related to two items in the 2022 outlook.
The first one is your volume and mix assumption.
In the fourth quarter, when I look at the North American walk, your wholesale were up something like 60,000 units year over year, but the volume mix piece of your North American bridge was up only $100 million, and that's despite what F-150 may be up like 34% year over year if IHS is right.
And so, just curious what's going on in terms of mix and why that contribution didn't really flow through to the EBIT.
And how do you think about, as you grow your volume 10% to 15% in 2022, what kind of EBIT contribution can we expect from this? That's the first item.
And then, the second one is in terms of additional investment costs, so you've quantified a step-up in CapEx for 2022.
I'm just curious if there are things in the income statement that you're able to quantify in terms of additional investments in technology that we should think about as we model 2022.
"
2820,F,2021,4,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,
2821,F,2021,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
I have just two questions.
So first, you've got a lot of growth that you're targeting in BEVs and digital businesses.
So it's not surprising that we would see some structural cost inflation.
What we're seeing right now is actually really benign.
This $200 million in the quarter, considering what you've got going on.
But maybe can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the feathering in of those additional structural costs, which presumably come in ahead of the revenue? So how should we think about that as we look out to the next year or two?
"
2822,F,2021,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"Can you just give us any sort of brackets around what -- I mean you did mention that 25% of the EV spending will be expensed.
But any sort of thoughts on the magnitude of what that headwind is?
"
2823,F,2021,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"OK.
And I was a little surprised about the comment about just 10% volume growth for next year.
It seems to me like the Renesas fire and Texas storms alone might have knocked 200,000 units of your production in Q2.
And it wasn't too long ago that you guys were routinely doing over 700,000 units a quarter.
So do you have any thoughts that you might be able to share about when would you be able to get back up to that kind of a level of production? And if so, when should we expect that to happen?

Jim, nobody has, I think, explained as lucidly and clearly the always on and the Ford Pro stuff the way you have, right? So you get kudos for that.
But you're seeing some of your competitors who make some spherical investments in the downstream to make kind of -- for that customer experience.
Volkswagen buying your car.
And some start-ups, including ones that you know pretty well kind of owning that physical part of it.
Is there any gap in your strategy as you go always on and really the full service -- is there anything you want to vertically integrate to either the Ford umbrella? Or is working with the franchisers and the third parties sufficient given this big change in [Inaudible]?

Some people say they're gouging, that might be unfair because they're paying high prices, too, for the vehicles, but we're starting to see four handles, five handles, six-handled GPUs all in, it's really big chunk at the price of a car, Jim.
At the risk of selling do you think you're making too much because I know that's a grouchy question, do you think as far as that, that you can capture for a Ford in the consumer?

Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.
Well, this month marks one year since we began executing our Ford+ plan.
It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles.
We built a strong team that combines top leaders from Ford, with world-class talent recruited from outside of our company, specific talent, specific people that are largely outside of our industry.
This leadership team is committed to this plan, and we're accelerating our progress.
Now, Ford+ is not a tag line.
It's not advertising.
It's a larger, more ambitious way to think about our business and how we bring value to our customers.
We're creating iconic and distinctive products that only Ford can do, increasingly always-on relationships with our customers and ever-improving user experiences, all while creating value for our shareholders.
We're fully vested in this future, and we're taking big swings.
Key to the plan is harnessing the power of connectivity.
We're designing a new generation of fully networked vehicles, not delegated to our supply chain, but done inside the company to revolutionize the experience of owning and operating Ford vehicle.
That's embedded technology to unleash unlimited innovation.
We're scaling the number of vehicles capable of over their updates.
We'll be moving from 1 million vehicles today to 33 million by 2028.
That's scale.
At the same time, we're moving aggressively to lead the electric vehicle revolution, substantially expanding our battery production as we speak today in the U.S.
In fact, we already announced plans that will give us enough battery production to meet our mid-decade goal of 141 gigawatts, which is enough to build more than 1 million battery electric vehicles a year, and I think we'll need more.
Our $7 billion investment in BlueOval City in Tennessee and the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale, sustainability, advanced manufacturing, and training the next generation of technology leaders.
At the same time, the $1 billion of investment in our electrified center in Cologne, Germany will allow us to go all electric soon.
That center will be all electric by 2023.
We're making final preparations to launch the F-150 Lightning, the defining zero-emission version of America's best-selling vehicle for the past 40-plus years.
Our all-electric Mustang Mach-E is a hit with customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world, bringing a stunning number of new customers to the Ford brand.
Over 90% of the Mach-E owners say they would recommend a Mach-E to other customers, critical as a new generation of battery electric customers make new brand choices.
Our challenge now is to break production constraints and increase availability to meet this incredible demand both in North America and in Europe and also in China, the biggest EV market in the world where we are just starting production of Mach-E.
We believe the global demand just for Mustang Mach-E could approach about 200,000 vehicles a year.
We've created new organization, Ford Pro, to change and power the future work with compelling commercial vehicles, distribution, and services, while growing revenues to Ford.
In the few weeks, we will start production of the new E-Transit, an electric version of the world's best-selling commercial van.
And in the third quarter alone, FORDLiive, Europe's new connected uptime center, which I wish you could all see for our commercial customers, helps customers in the U.K.
secure additional uptime, preventing about $8 million of lost revenue and associated costs for our valuable customers.
We're reinventing icons like Bronco and creating new ones like Maverick.
In fact, the all-new Maverick, 42 miles per gallon, I might add, is the first standard hybrid pickup in the United States.
It's also America's most fuel-efficient hybrid pickup.
This is the strongest, most compelling lineup I've ever seen from any mass-market brand in my career.
And we are creating a spring-loaded future as we emerge from the chip shortages and COVID constraints, and we continue to make important strides in the technology and go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.
In the second quarter, we told you about a new partnership with Argo AI and Lyft.
And in the third quarter, we announced a new partnership with Argo AI and Walmart.
This is Walmart's first-ever multicity autonomous delivery service, and it will be anchored in cities where we already have operations, not the easiest miles in one city, but multiple cities and hard miles.
In addition to making real progress on autonomy vehicles, operating domains, SDS, we fully support Argo AI's aspiration to access public capital.
To build this future and generate the margins and cash flow we need to fund Ford+, we had to turn around our automotive operations and improve our competitiveness.
Our results in the third quarter show we are making significant progress.
In fact, companywide, we achieved an 8.4% EBIT margin, including 10.1% in North America.
Those margins, I'll remind you, are in line with our targets for 2023.
More importantly, our operations outside of North America are likely to post their best performance in four years.
Please note the performance in South America, largely driven by our success of our global redesign.
We've been able to achieve this while thoughtfully managing our supply chain for short-term sustainable improvements, including semiconductors, and prioritizing high-demand and high-profit vehicles.
Now before I turn it over to John, a few thoughts.
I believe we have the right plan to drive growth and unlock unprecedented value.
You are already seeing a favorable change in the slope of our earnings and cash flow.
There is more to come.
Given the strength of our business this year, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance to between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion.
As we plan in earnest for next year, we're excited and energized about the opportunity in front of us and clear that we have so much more work to do to deliver on Ford's potential.
The word I would leave you with is focus.
The competitive environment has never been more interesting and tough, and we intend to live up to our promise to compete like a challenger, focusing on our top priorities to unlock Ford+ growth with customers at the very center of everything we do.
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will take you through our results for the quarter, our outlook for the full year, our capital allocation priorities, and our expectations heading into next year.
John?

"
2832,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Well, I think we're in good shape for now.
Obviously, the acceleration of the BEV business and our ICE assets will be, I think, the next big transition for the whole industry, not just Ford.
But Ford specifically, India is really the principal region country where we have struggled over time.
And it's really great to see the progress the team is making in India and the very vibrant position we'll now have with the new lineup.
And I'd just like to highlight the progress in South America for this quarter.
John, when is the last time we were profitable in South America?

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC.
"
2834,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Great.
Thank you.
We're shipping with Mach-E F-Series now BlueCruise as they leave the factory, and we're going to be OTA-ing BlueCruise in the first quarter.
We wanted to improve the customer experience.
So we pushed it back in terms of an OTA because we want it to be much simpler for the customer than was originally planned.
And that takes a little planning to consolidate.
Often these level 2 systems require multiple updates to the car, we want it to be very simple.
That took a little bit more work on our team's part.
And so it's available as we ship products now.
And as an OTA, it will be in the first quarter, and it will be a lot simpler to use and get that OTA and update for the customer than it was originally planned.
Does that answer your question?
"
2835,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Thanks.
Such an important question for the company.
I'd like John to comment on the margins.
Right now, we have three high-volume, very well-accepted battery-electric vehicles on our hands, Mach-E, E-Transit, and the F-150 Lightning.
So the way we look at it is, we want to grow this business really fast.
Just the Mach-E demand itself, we think, is 200,000 units.
That does not include the Lightning or the E-Transit.
So our first job is, of course, post job 1 customer experience improvement.
Post job 1 simplification and improvement of the cost of the vehicle.
And post job 1 quality improvements using the data off the vehicles.
But perhaps our biggest job, in my opinion, is to break the constraints we have in manufacturing and our supply chain so we can get these products out to these customers.
And that post job 1 orientation is quite different than how we historically looked at the ICE business where we wait to a minor change or something later to make those changes.
The constraint from Mach-E right now is batteries.
We think we can break some of those constraints by working creatively with our China team and get batteries from China.
So stay tuned, and I'll ask John to comment on the margins.
"
2836,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Mission-critical.
For us to truly disrupt personal ownership, we have to democratize shared mobility.
And the self-driving and mobility in the driven world are absolutely mission-critical for the company to disrupt ourself.
I am really proud of the team's progress.
It's different than our competitors in the space.
We've gone to the most difficult miles in four, five different cities.
Our mapping, our SDS deployment, and the algorithms are built to be scaled for production deployment.
So we're not going to a small market area in easy miles like others.
We're taking on the toughest problems now and building our capability for scaling quickly.
And I think that's always been our approach.
The relationship with Argo and us and Volkswagen is very close, but we do see us moving into more of a production mode now, and we're really ready for that.
And we think this will take more capital and a little more time, and we think the access to public capital is really mission-critical for our journey.
"
2837,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Great question.
Our philosophy is different.
We think partnership on the demand layers for autonomy and pre-autonomy is mission-critical for our always-on strategy.
Are there pieces missing that we're working really hard on? You bet you.
We're not going to talk about them today, though.

2838,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Well, this is also really important.
First of all, I would say the heart and soul of Ford's strategy is our commercial business.
In that business where vehicles are highly utilized, our dealer network is one of our most important advantages versus the new competitors.
I'll give you some statistics.
We have 650 dedicated commercial, mostly service centers in the United States and 850 transit centers across Europe.
That will take a lot of time and a lot of money for someone to recreate.
Every one of those dealers has multiple bodybuilders that can call design for those trades in those locations for our Ford vehicles.
So the dealer body is not only important for the aftersales experience in making sure those vehicles can be serviced, but it's also mission-critical for the outfit of those products.
So the dealer network is absolutely strategically critical for our leadership and maintaining that as we go to digital connected vehicles for our commercial customers.
There's no doubt that many customers want a three or four-click, very easy service experience on the retail side.
And we're working really carefully on that, including a simple e-commerce platform.
And actually, in China, our BEV business already has 25 direct stores by the end of this year.
So we're starting to experiment.
I think our dealers have served us really well.
I'm very proud of them.
I'm especially proud of our commercial dealer.
And we are very vigilant.
You can imagine, I get lots of emails every day about transaction prices from customers on our hottest products.
And we all feel obligated to represent the brand professionally for our customers.
"
2839,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,
2840,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"As of today.
"
2841,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Thank you for your question.
A lot of the product we've been working on for several years.
We made the tough choices.
I would say the answer is, we have a plan.
It's not an advertising or PR tag lines.
It's our plan.
Everyone in the company knows what we have to do.
We are out of time and we have focus.
We need to get an 8% margin like we did this quarter as a company regularly because we have to fund a high-growth BEV and digital business.
It's not to make more money.
Yes, it is that, but it's motivated in the mission of transforming Ford through these digital products.
So running the ICE business for cash, getting serious about our cost, our quality, our launches, our 8% return, it's all a mission, and the team knows the plan.
And I think the culture is starting to change, to be quicker, more accountability, less bureaucracy.
And that mission permeates through the company.
I'm probably the worst person to ask whether something has changed because it sure has changed for me and my leadership team.
But to me, the proof is in the pudding, like our third quarter.
And whether we've really changed as a company will be proven out in our numbers over time like they have the last year.
"
2842,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"If we make up our mind and we come together as a team like we did on Maverick, it could be just two years.
We did -- we knocked 20 months off the Maverick development, but it required the leadership team to not have the handwringing on the studio for six months like we normally did.
I think that's a new proof point.
But the question I ask myself is a little different.
When we see a technology change like this -- like BEV, it's not just the speed of your product creation.
It's can you be flexible and agile in your industrial system like in manufacturing.
We have three complete hits on our hands, a Mach-E with 200,000 units of demand.
That's -- we have the Lightning with over 160,000 orders, and the E-Transit is completely sold out.
So, how I like to think about it, it's not just the product creation speeding up.
It's whole company.
And we have to do our job to break constraints now so that we can deliver hundreds of thousands of battery electrics next year.
That, to me, is the proof of our change, not just how fast the product creation process works.
"
2843,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Thank you so much for your question.
I'll ask John to comment.
From my view, the order bank model that we're going through in North America that we're in right now has benefits across the patch.
We are an incredibly complicated company.
And so having an order bank allows us to push simplification into the order, the customer-facing options, which we need to do, and it reduces cost and improves our quality.
Number two, it eliminates the need for expensive conquest fixed marketing.
Number three, it's incredibly helpful for industrial system.
You cannot imagine, Ryan, how much money we waste by not -- by guessing what our launch mix is for a new product.
When you have an order bank, especially for new models, you could capacitize the high series mix that are very profitable right in line with customer demand.
So it's incredibly cost-effective, and it allows you to address the long-tail revenues that we have lost in the past because of our internal ground stock model.
And the last one is, it's lower cost.
There's less parts hanging around.
We can manage our industrial system and our manufacturing in a leaner way.
The question really is, how we maintain it, as you said, as the market improves.
And the way we're looking at that is not just having a day supply target in the past that we've managed but actually putting in the infrastructure to maintain or prefer an order-based system.
That means we train our system to put in orders.
We reward people for putting in orders.
We dynamically price for customers so that they're incentivized to keep ordering versus buying off the lot.
So it's going to be a journey.
It's been a very rewarding one so far, and we're just beginning.
This is the model we have to go through as most of our business or majority of our business goes battery electric and digital.
It's the right loyalty model.
"
2844,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"The move to a digital product means we have to go to a 100% loyalty model.
So the reason why you're seeing us launch battery electrics early is very simple.
It's our Super Bowl ad.
Our new Super Bowl ad -- our new Detroit Motor Show is our reveal because this starts the clock on reservations, and you have to do it early enough, so your industrial system gets informed by the results of your reservation.
That's the closed loop that has to happen.
We need to open it early enough so that our industrial system can react to the orders, and we don't waste money and take advantage of long-tail revenue.
And it's a more controlled environment than a broadcast media advertising on the Super Bowl.
"
2845,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"That's OK.
I was just going to say, our fleet business now, now that we've rationalized the company, our fleet business is very strategic for us.
It's also very profitable.
It certainly varies in Europe and North America and China.
Different fleet segments have different profitability.
The one thing I would ask you to think about is that most of the fleet that matters at Ford is commercial vehicles.
And the most important commercial vehicles for us is small, medium-sized businesses, and those are very profitable business for us.
Ford Transit for Super Duty.
That's where Ford excels in the fleet business and its smaller fleets.
It's not big fleet sales.
So the texture of this is that we're revenue-managing the company very carefully.
We know the margins by geography, even within the country, and we know by distribution channel.
So this is a very thoughtful approach for us.
But strategically, especially because of the Pro business and its profitability, we want to make sure we have -- we're reliable partner with fleet customers.
They do business with companies that are reliable.
They don't come in and out of the market.
They do business with companies that have a full range of products, a full range of services.
That's why Marion is investing in Ford Pro and why we're vertically integrating our services.
So I think we have a really good profitable fleet business around the world.
We look at the margins very carefully, but it's strategically very important for the company to be a reliable partner.
"
2846,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Well, John, I think you should answer that one in terms of how we revenue-manage in a constrained environment.
"
2847,F,2021,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"In the Escape business, we now have another player called Bronco Sport in the segment.
It's incredibly profitable, and people really appreciate the product.
We are not in the business of commodity products in that segment anymore.
We've changed.
We made that investment several years ago.
"
2848,F,2021,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my questions.
I just wanted to clarify, I saw your original guidance was that the first -- the second half was supposed to be up in volume, 30%.
I mean I'm not sure if I'm misreading it, it sounds like Q3 may be up a bit from Q4.
So is that 30% still not accurate? Obviously, it's kind of important when you think about the 10% into 2022, what pace we're going off of?
"
2849,F,2021,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,1,"Got it, John.
That's very helpful.
"
2850,F,2021,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,2,"Yes.
No, that's great.
And just secondly, in terms of the redesign plan that's been out for a while, is India the last major step? I mean is this going to sort of -- is this fit over next quarter, maybe the last time we see these slides? Just got of curious.
Or is there more still coming?
"
2851,F,2021,3,colin-langan,wells-fargo-securities,True,3,
2852,F,2021,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, everybody.
Thanks for making the call efficient.
I think it's going to be tough to limit to one question, but I will.
As you think about the 10% increase you're talking about in 2022 wholesales, and if we could focus on North America and just, you know, assume you're going to do about 2 million units this year and '21, give or take, we're only talking about 200,000 units of increase next year.
You know, there's an assumption that price and mix will deteriorate, and incremental units are produced as the semi shortage is relieved.
But given that, that's still going to be a relatively low -- a very low level of production, do you believe that the price and mix are really going to actually come under pressure next year? And aren't we really going to stay in a very tight environment that you're selling through and not even building inventory, if that's true, which means that price and mix might stay very strong next year, and they'll still get the benefit?
"
2853,F,2021,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"And just to follow up on that.
I think right now, based on awards, you have about 213,000 units in dealer inventory.
Pre-COVID, travel rate was about 650,000 units.
You know, as you think about ultimately getting into a time where you can rebuild or restock that inventory, where do you think that runs? And how much opportunity is there to try to maintain some of this mix and price discipline to offset any cost inflation and then also invest in the future?
"
2854,F,2021,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"To be exact.
It sounds like you're on that.
And maybe if I could sneak one in just on capital allocation real quick on the dividend.
I mean why now? And I'll hop back in the queue.
"
2855,F,2021,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,"Great.
Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
"
2856,F,2021,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,4,
2857,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thank you, Jim.
Now in the face of continued industrywide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation.
We delivered a solid quarter with $3 billion in adjusted company EBIT and a margin of 8.4%.
Free cash flow of $7.7 billion was, as we expected, up sharply on a sequential basis driven by the positive working capital effects from higher wholesale and EBIT.
We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity at over $31 billion and $47 billion, respectively.
Now across our automotive business, our playbook remained consistent as we optimize production for customer orders, new launches, and our most profitable vehicles.
And as expected, on a sequential basis, our wholesales improved dramatically as chip supply for Ford improved.
We also remain disciplined with incentive spending and mix management, which, on a year-over-year basis, more than offset chip-related declines in volume.
Ford Credit delivered another solid quarter with $1.1 billion in EBT as auction values continue to remain strong and credit losses continue at near-record lows.
For the fourth quarter, we're assuming a sequential increase in wholesale.
We also expect continued healthy mix and net pricing and solid results from Ford Credit, although not as strong as the third quarter.
Headwinds include inflationary impacts on commodities and freight, and we also expect planned sequential increases in our Ford+ modernization investments, including customer experience and IT.
So let me share with you some highlights from the quarter before I turn to guidance, capital allocation, and our preliminary view of 2022.
With improved chip supply, North America wholesales increased sequentially by 67% as the team prioritized launches, customer orders, and high-margin units while reducing the number of vehicles built but waiting for chips.
Demand remains strong for our exciting vehicles.
The order bank we are building paid off in the third quarter, representing 28% of our retail sales in the third quarter and reaching a high of 31% in September.
And our overall customer orders increased over 50% from the second quarter to more than 100,000 orders, excluding Bronco.
With a 10.1% EBIT margin in the quarter, North America is now at a 9% margin year to date, just 100 basis points shy of our 2023 target of 10%.
South America marked its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBIT, and the business run rate is now approaching breakeven.
The region also launched its new commercial vehicle organization with the introduction of the new Transit, which is manufactured in Uruguay.
This Transit is the first light commercial van to market in Brazil that includes connectivity as a standard feature.
In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to strengthen, though the adverse impact from chips has masked this improvement.
In the third quarter, the business lost about 50,000 units, which would have had a substantial favorable impact on EBIT.
Our leadership as the No.
1 commercial vehicle brand continued in the quarter, along with an extremely robust order bank.
In China, Lincoln continues to perform well, extending its success in the most profitable segment luxury.
With retail sales up 24% year over year, in fact, Lincoln has doubled its share of the China luxury market over the past 18 months.
Our newly created BEV organization to open its first 13 direct-to-consumer Ford Select city stores, with a total of 25 expected to open by year-end.
In IMG, our leadership team in India made the difficult decision to end manufacturing following accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion over the past 10 years.
Going forward, we will focus on importing iconic vehicles, including EVs.
And overall, IMG had a solid quarter, capitalizing on our strengths, including Ranger.
Now as Jim highlighted, the underlying strength of our business supports increasing our adjusted EBIT guidance for 2021 to between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion, and that's despite a lower-than-anticipated improvement in chip availability in the second half of the year.
Consistent with our adjusted EBIT guidance through this year, our updated guidance for 2021 includes the $900 million noncash gain on our investment in Rivian in our first-quarter adjusted results.
So let me spend a minute on Rivian.
Now in the event that Rivian completes its IPO, we will record any gain on our investment in any subsequent adjustments as special items.
Accordingly, we will recast the $900 million noncash gain from adjusted EBIT in the first quarter to a special item.
If Rivian completes their IPO in the fourth quarter, we will make this change when we report our fourth-quarter earnings on February 3, 2022.
Our guidance for 2021 adjusted free cash flow is unchanged at $4 billion to $5 billion, reflecting the higher EBIT, but less favorable improvement in working capital and timing difference -- timing differences.
Now, this is due to lower-than-anticipated volumes than previously assumed in the back half of the quarter, and that's as a result of chip constraints.
We do expect free cash flow to increase with higher production and the associated improvement in supplier payables and other timing differences.
So now let me turn to capital allocation, which again is the foundation of our value creation framework.
Our capital allocation discipline is driving a strong core business and balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities as we deliver our Ford+ plan.
Ultimately, it ensures we return value to our shareholders, both in the form of a higher share price and dividends.
Today, we announced the reinstatement of our dividend.
Our board has approved restarting a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Importantly, the dividend reflects our confidence in the improving run rate of the business and our ability to fund all of our calls on capital, including the growing investment in electrification and the trajectory of our Ford+ plan.
The dividend was also sized to ensure we maintain appropriate optionality to manage continued uncertainties in the external environment.
To give you a better sense of our calls on capital between 2020 and 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of about $40 billion to $45 billion or a run rate of roughly $7 billion per year.
Now over the same time, we expect to invest over $30 billion in BEVs.
And of the investment in BEVs, about 50% is capex, 25% is expense and 25% is direct investments.
And these numbers, they'll be dynamic, and we are confident we have ample financial flexibility to increase our investment, even if BEV adoption further accelerates.
Now let me share with you our early thinking about 2022, a year, which, like this one, is likely to experience some industry crosswinds that could drive a range of outcomes.
Now we typically don't talk about the upcoming year this soon, and we're not yet prepared to give financial guidance, but we do want to share how we're thinking about next year, given the dynamic operating environment.
Ford's underlying strengths give me great confidence we can build on our results in 2021.
First, our portfolio of products and services is exceptional, and we have a significant amount of new product coming to market spanning our iconic high-volume nameplates.
Second, our industrial base gives us significant optionality as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates.
Third, driven by the chip shortage to roughly $4 million in wholesales we are likely to deliver this year fall significantly below our capacity.
And based on our current assessment, we believe our wholesales could be up about 10% in 2022, but that number is very dynamic and changes almost weekly.
And fourth, the effects of our global redesign, which is largely completed, are now evident and substantial.
We have drastically de-risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, vastly improving our earnings and cash generation power in the process.
Now for headwinds next year, it's difficult to predict the interplay between semiconductor-related constraints, volume, and pricing, and this will continue to remain dynamic.
For 2021, we expect commodities to be up $3 billion to $3.5 billion, and they could be up another $1.5 billion in 2022, largely driven by steel and aluminum similar to this year.
There will also likely be other inflationary costs, but it's too early to size that right now.
Ford Credit is likely to be lower as strong auction values will be moderated by a smaller inventory of vehicles and lower lease and return rates.
And lastly, we're obviously going to continue to invest in our Ford+ plan for growth and value creation, and this includes in customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always-on relationships with customers, and electrification.
And of course, we believe the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial.
Now that wraps up our prepared remarks.
And if you perceive that the upfront portion of these calls is becoming more efficient, well, you're right.
And that's a function of us being very specific with you and our team about what's truly important and our confidence in executing effectively against those things and reporting, accordingly.
We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your minds.
Thank you.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] We do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.
Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.
"
2858,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Thanks, John.
John here.
You're right, it's going to remain dynamic.
And that's what the interplay is going to be.
You know, volume increases for the industry if they're higher, we'll probably see more pressure on price.
If they remain as they are today, we see a moderate increase.
I think you're going to continue to see strong pricing and mix continue through next year.
So that's where we have to stay disciplined, and we have to stay very focused on managing that well so that we can have, as you said, the play through next year relative to what happens from an overall volume standpoint, and we're focused on that.
So I agree with you.
That's going to be one of the key dynamic elements for next year.
"
2859,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"So, it's interesting because I remember those days when Don probably made that comment about rental fleets and that they were low margin, etc.
I think what you're finding is business models are changing, and the fleet business is evolving, just like everything else in our industry.
And we see that there could potentially be a positive fleet business where they could make good money.
And so we're not going to shy away from that if we see that it's right for our brand, and we think it's right for the bottom line.
And so we're going to continue to look at fleets differently.
We're going to continue to think about vehicles as a service and what that potential holds for us as that business model changes, and we'll see where that takes us.
But we're not going to go back to the times where we're putting in capacity, we're pumping out units, selling them at little to no margin for rental cars.
That's not going to happen again.
And -- go ahead.
I'm sorry.
"
2860,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
So as you would expect, we're very conscientious about the dynamic of the supply and demand and the impact that, that has on the pricing.
And we look at this on a daily basis, managing our incentives, looking at if we should be taking top-line pricing given the inflationary pressures we're seeing.
And as we talked about, we're not going to go back to the old habit of loading up the dealers with stock and then looking through the push-through of -- for sales.
We're going to focus more on orders coming through online.
Specific orders to customers being satisfied, understanding what their demands are, simplifying the system.
And with all of that, we expect to retain quite a bit of the price.
Now, will it mitigate as we go through next year as supply and demand comes more in balance and into '23? Yes.
But our job is going to be to manage that and retain as much pricing as we can and -- while providing customers good value for those products.
So it's something that we look at very closely on a daily basis.
"
2861,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yes.
Colin, that's a great question.
Thank you.
Now we did say last quarter that we expected the second half to be up about 30%.
Looks like it's going to be up somewhere around 15%.
And so what you're seeing flow-through is the strength we had in the quarter relative to the top line and other actions that we took relative to cost, etc.
So when you look at that walk, that bridge between Q3 to Q4, we expect market factors to be positive.
We said we think volume is going to be up sequentially about 10%.
We also see a little bit stronger mix continuing.
And then, of course, you'll have some product-related costs, production-related costs associated with that.
But net-net, market factors net of those costs to produce the increased volumes is going to be positive.
What we're seeing from a headwind standpoint, if you look at Q3 to Q4, are commodities.
We expect that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they're going to be up about $700 million.
And if you look at that, so far year to date, we've seen about $1.6 billion of commodities hit us.
And when you get to the fourth quarter, and you get the cumulative effect of that.
On a year-over-year basis, commodities are going to be up about another $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
So year over year, up $1.5 billion, sequentially, up $700 million.
And then we are going to see some higher warranty costs on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter for things that we have to take care of around extended warranties and a little bit higher coverages.
But again, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty will improve in the fourth quarter and full year on a year-over-year basis.
Our warranty, we expect to be good by about $1.4 billion.
"
2862,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Does that help you with the bridge?
"
2863,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"I believe it was 2013.
"
2864,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
So what we're seeing there is that we've got the EBIT coming in, right, that improvement, but the less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences hitting us in the quarter because we have lower-than-anticipated volume in the back half of the quarter due to the chip constraints.
And so we get hit with that working capital at the end of the year.
So that's what's happening to us on the free cash flow.
So it's a timing issue.
"
2865,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"So of the $30 billion, when you look at the cap, very little -- when you said about half of that was cap, very little of that has been spent through 2021 relative to the 13 -- to the $15 billion, about half of it.
Of course, you're going to see the expense front-loaded because that's primarily the engineering that we have in developing the battery electric vehicles.
And then the direct investment, which is about 25% of it, that's for things like the vertical integration of the JVs and those types of things.
And you saw those announcements this quarter with our plan in BlueOval SK, the battery plant.
So that's how we're going to unfold that spending over time.
"
2866,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
So we're not going to give a number at this point, Itay, but what we're saying is that the strength of our new product lineup, our high-volume nameplates like in the strength of what we're seeing from Mach-E, as Jim said, we think there's about demand for 200,000 units.
We've got the Bronco and Maverick, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning are coming.
It's the best lineup we've had.
And so that's going to be a tailwind for us for sure as we go into next year.
And you're seeing that come through this year, and we're going to build on that, but we're also going to have to manage the headwinds that we've talked about and the other puts and takes.
But what we can tell you is we are laser-focused on getting to the 8% target in 2023.
And so we will manage into next year.
These are the types of things we're seeing from a puts and takes standpoint, strengths, and all the tailwinds and then the headwinds.
And we will manage that next year, and we'll be on the path next year toward our 8% target in 2020.
"
2867,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Good evening.
"
2868,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"All right.
Well, as we talked about last quarter, Mach-E is EBIT profitable today, but we also know -- we also know that the margins are not as strong as our ICE margins.
And so we're working on that.
Over time, we expect as we scale, as you said.
And as the technology costs come down, we will grow those margins.
And ultimately, we do expect with these connected vehicles, these connected BEVs that the profit margins will be better than what we're seeing on ICE today, but that's over time.
"
2869,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Yeah.
So if you look at where we ended in September, we ended at about 20 days supply in the U.S., and we're watching it very closely from a day supply standpoint.
And as we talked about last quarter, you know, our historical day supply was somewhere around 75 days.
We're not going back there.
And as Jim said, we're going to be very disciplined, and we expect to be, you know, in the 50-day supply when we're fully at full capacity, and we're running and producing everything that we can.
So that's going to be the key.
The other thing I would say, John, is that the move, as we talked about in our remarks, to having more of our sales come through orders, online orders in the order bank, that's really important for us to manage our day supply so that it's less of a, you know, ground stock push through and its customer demand pull-through based on the orders.
And we had over 100,000 orders at the end of the quarter, and that's grown since then in our order bank.
And that played well for us in the third quarter.

2871,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,14,"As of --
"
2872,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,15,"Yeah.
It's the underlying strength of the business, John.
And, you know, we're not capital constrained.
We're able to fund our initiatives for growth.
We know that there are going to be other opportunities that surface.
We're confident that we can fund those, and we're focused on total shareholder returns, not only stock appreciation but also the dividend.
And so given the strength of the business, the board elected that we would restart the dividend this quarter.
"
2873,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,16,"Yeah.
So from the magnesium standpoint, when we look at that, you know, we are seeing price pressure on aluminum broadly.
You know, we saw that all year, and we probably see a little bit more price pressure due to the magnesium issue.
But our sheet metal suppliers, our sheet aluminum suppliers don't purchase magnesium from China for North American production.
So we don't see that having any significant impact or any impact on us.
We do see the chip issue continuing to run through '22.
As we said, it's very dynamic.
Right now, you ask us what we think the sequential increase in supply will be year over year, we think we'll have about 10% more, but that's changing weekly.
And we're doing everything we can to get our hands on as many chips as we can.
But we do see that running through 2022.
It could extend into 2023, although we do anticipate the scope and severity of that to reduce as we move through '22 into '23.
"
2874,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,17,"Yeah, Rod.
We'll start to see those come in as we get into '22, and then they'll feather in through '23 as we continue to ramp our investments in our plan, our priorities, not only in the products, the BEVs, but also as we're building out our customer-facing technologies, our connectivity, etc.
So yes, you'll see that start to come in on a year-over-year basis next year, and it will continue in through '23.
"
2875,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,18,"Not -- I'm not ready to do that today for '22 and going in through '23.
We're completely targeted on getting to that 8% in 2023.
So we'll manage it within that.
But today, I'm not ready to talk in that level of detail about it.
"
2876,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,19,"Right.
So I think what you'll find is that, as you look through 2022, the first half, we'll have less supply than through the second half.
And as I said earlier, we see this mitigating over time.
It may extend into 2023.
But I would say that we should be back up and running based on what we're seeing today, a run rate, the end of next year into '23.
And then in 2023, we'd start to rebuild our inventories.
But it's dynamic, Rod, and it's hard to make a pinpoint call at this point in time.
But we wanted to share with you what we're seeing is that we're seeing about 10% for next year.
And we see that the chip constraint is going to still hit us.
It's going to still be a factor next year.
So we have to keep managing as we are this year.
"
2877,F,2021,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,20,"So, we're going to continue to work and focus on improving our business, right? Our target is to have an investment-grade balance sheet, but that's going to come by improving the business.
And you're seeing the strength of that come through.
And so that's what we're focused on.
What the rating agencies decide to do with our rating, they'll manage that, and that's up to them.
What we're laser focused on is improving the run rate of the business, improving our performance, improving our overall metrics.
And eventually, the rating agencies and the ratings will take care of themselves.
"
2878,F,2021,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Hey, good evening.
Thank you for taking the question.
I'd first just like to ask a question on the shape of recovery in volumes.
A, is this magnesium shortage going to cause any sort of near-term supply disruption for you? I mean we heard some draconian comments that it could just outright stop European production, and just maybe you can give us a sense broadly of how you anticipate the shape of recovery, you know, in terms of volumes.
At what point do we get -- or is your baseline expectation that the chip shortage is fully mitigated, and you can be back at full run rate production?
"
2879,F,2021,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"Great.
Thank you.
Second question, I'd like to zoom out, it's a bit more strategic.
I think if we just look at the pace of progress at Ford, just both financially and in terms of EV, AV, halting digital, and just what we're seeing today is it's far greater than what you saw 12 or 18 months ago, which is actually pretty impressive given the large organization just takes time to really affect change.
So I just want to -- I'm trying to understand how much of what we're seeing today was something that was always there and just only starting to come to the surface now, you're sort of getting the fruits of prior initiatives? Or has something fundamentally changed in the past 12, 18 months? What does this just tell us about the pace of change at Ford with the next comparison? Maybe just to be a bit more specific because I know you can take that in a number of ways.
Maybe you can answer that specifically to what we're seeing on product and planning on the business transition to EV.
"
2880,F,2021,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,2,"And just to be more specific on the product front because I think we're seeing a much faster pace of product, is the time of development products like -- how much have you accelerated that? Meaning, typically, in the past, we hear of three and a half to four years of drawing board to product in showroom.
Is there a new normal for what that is?
"

Good evening, everybody.
Just two quick ones for me.
First, is there any update on the BlueCruise deployment, including through OTA, maybe some initial customer feedback?
"
2886,F,2021,3,itay-michaeli,citi,True,1,"Yeah.
That's very, very helpful.
And then maybe just a super quick follow-up, just a point of clarification.
Thank you for the 2022 initial indications.
In the release, at least it mentioned you expect to build on the strong performance in 2021.
I'm just curious of that -- if we should interpret that as you expect to grow EBIT adjusted year over year in 2022.

Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
"
2888,F,2021,3,itay-michaeli,citi,True,3,
2889,F,2021,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,0,"Two questions.
First, a quick -- not quite housekeeping, but definitely, balance sheet question.
As you restated the dividend at the level, just could you maybe talk us through the investment-grade rating implications and timeline to get there that you consider -- that you and the board considered when setting that?
"
2890,F,2021,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,1,"OK.
Second question.
As you think about that 10% volume increase, rough guidance, a couple of things, one, where do you see fleet sales coming back as you kind of bring that up? And second, are you going to take a different attitude toward fleet sales than in sort of the past? I remember Don Leclair saying, he had two factories making door assist.
And rental car companies were about the only buyers for them.
So -- but there's also -- to really rental cars, but maybe some of the government business that's not -- police is not quite the same.
And kind of related to that, as you kind of think about prioritizing production, are there models where you're more comfortable you'll get good price retention, and other models, and I'm going to pick on like the Escape maybe that have a lot of competition in their segment and as capacity comes back less likely to hold price, say, compared to a Bronco.
"
2891,F,2021,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,2,"OK.
And in terms of price retention and how that's going to vary across your product line?
"
2892,F,2021,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,3,"Thank you.

2895,F,2021,3,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Hi, thanks for taking my question.
I thought to ask a few on the order bank, just given the commentary that it grew 50% sequentially in 3Q, excluding the Bronco.
So can you talk about the benefits of the order bank? How it helps to optimize your operations? And what kind of pricing or other trends you might be seeing with regard to the order bank? And then how much of the increase in orders do you think may stem from the currently very strong new product cadence or from the currently low inventory environment? And what avenues are there available to drive orders as industry conditions eventually normalize?
"
2896,F,2021,3,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,"OK.
Great.
And then just as a quick follow-up to that.
It seems as which was discussed earlier that product development times are speeding up, maybe particularly with regard to EVs.
The Lightning, for example, seems to come together very fast.
Another trend seems to be that automakers are revealing their EVs for a longer period of time before the actual start of production, maybe because they're so eager to show them, consumers are so clamoring for them.
Does that mean that you think that order banks and ordering in advance might be even more popular with electric vehicles? What are you seeing with regard to that?

2899,F,2021,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Thank you.
Maybe just one quick one on the free cash guidance, which I think you maintained despite the EBIT guidance going higher.
So is there something going on with working capital or something because you're saying you're releasing more vehicles? So I wouldn't think that would actually be a positive factor in the fourth quarter as well.
So I'm curious what the offset is.
"
2900,F,2021,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"OK.
And then I want to go back to some of the BEV announcements you've made over the past couple of months.
And I know you talked again about the spend today, and you're now spending more than $30 billion.
And I appreciate the breakdown you gave us sort of how you're spending that.
Maybe this is just me, but I actually find it still fairly difficult to track what exactly you're spending over the coming years because I believe some of that has already been spent.
So is it possible to maybe just say like of that $30 billion, what's being spent like starting next year through the middle of the decade?

Two questions, please.
"
2904,F,2021,3,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"Two questions.
The first one, very pleased to see beyond a target and -- for this 8% margin by 2023, a big focus of the company and clearly showing some progress there.
How should we think about the impact on this from the margins on your electric vehicles? Obviously, the scale takes some time to build up, but you're going through that right now and probably have some level of visibility.
So what's your lead to thinking around trajectory for margins on some of your BEVs? And to what extent you will or will not impact overall company margins and potentially how do we think about it beyond 2023?
"
2905,F,2021,3,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,2,"Thank you.
And then my second question was on Argo.
So very encouraged to see that you would like to encourage them as supportive of accessing the public markets.
How do you envisage the future relationship between Ford and Argo to be? How important is that going to be as part of your overall business model?
"

Your final question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
"
2907,F,2021,3,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,4,
2908,F,2021,2,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
I just first wanted to clarify the answer that you gave to Brian's question.
So you're going to be annualizing at $6 billion to $8 billion in the back half.
And I think what a lot of people want to understand is, is that kind of a fair bridging-off point for us to think about what happens from here into 2022 and beyond? So did you assume some moderation of pricing already in that number? Is that level of investment kind of the run rate? And how should we think about the incremental benefit from that run rate for Bronco, Maverick, the further warranty improvement, and some of the international improvements that you're working on?
"
2909,F,2021,2,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"And just secondly, really interesting comment about that sevenfold increase in your order bank and changing the way that vehicles are sold.
Can you just talk a little bit about what that actually means from a volume perspective? Because I don't think we've ever really known what your actual customer order bank actually -- but what's the magnitude of that? Maybe you could just tell us what that number was a year ago.
And any thoughts on what this actually means for pricing? Obviously, it's positive, but those units are not going to land on dealer lots for very long.
So it would seem that there's really not a big reason to significantly boost incentives anytime soon if they're leaving lots very quickly.
"
2910,F,2021,2,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"Thanks.

2912,F,2021,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks.
Great call so far.
And, Jim, I have to say I did a Ctrl+F for the word hybrid in the deck and in the press release and I don't see it, man.
No hybrid.
It's a beautiful thing, so good.
"
2913,F,2021,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Yes.
But they're dead.
They're gone.
All right.
"
2914,F,2021,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"My question on EVs, right, your BEVs, when do you think that they can be a positive profit on a fully costed basis, not contribution? Like when can they be profitable? And do you think 2022 is still too early for that? My first and I have a follow-up.
"
2915,F,2021,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,"Well, I mean, that's incredible at a $50,000 type run rate for that to be correct.
OK.
My follow-on question, Jim, is about always-on in the order bank.
I mean, I think this is really huge.
Just really interesting, when you combine the order bank system with always-on, where you go kind of can engage the consumer directly for services and F&I and insurance and the OTA.
But I am talking to some dealers that are freaking out, that some Darwinian forces could be at work where you're not, let's say, directly infringing on the franchise laws but you're dancing close, as you probably should, given all the technological changes over the past 70 or 80 years since these laws came.
So what's your message to them? What if order book goes to 80% of your units or the majority and then the dealers are just the delivery centers and then you're going direct on all the other wonderful services? What's the message to the dealers?
"
2916,F,2021,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,4,
2917,F,2021,2,philippe-houchois,jefferies,True,0,"Yes.
Good afternoon.
Thank you very much.
I've got two questions.
The first one, sorry, go back on these order bank and inventory levels.
To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're talking about 50 to 60 days of inventory in the future because that's not much lower than what we've had in the past.
And I would have thought the order bank would actually enable you to actually carry much less inventory, and we've seen the benefit of that to pricing.
So I wonder if the 50, 60 days kind of the first step that you think you can do better in the future.
And along those lines and then maybe more on the Ford Credit side, but when I look at European car companies, they carry more finished products on their balance sheet, the core balance sheet, and then relatively less on the finco balance sheet through the dealer receivables they use as a proxy.
Is the opposite in the U.S.? And I'm just wondering, if you look at a situation where you go to more order banking for your production, if you end up carrying more inventory on your industrial balance sheet, which would increase your working capital requirement from an industrial standpoint.
That was my first question.
And the second one, if I can ask briefly on China.
It seems like you're stalling a bit in China.
And because you've localized a lot more of Lincoln, more profitable, you had big losses in consolidated side before.
And I'm just wondering, can you comment maybe on what is happening generally in China? There seems to be a concern about how the Chinese brands are making good progress.
Some of the EVs launched by your competitors are not quite getting the love from customers that was expected.
And I'm just wondering if you see a more difficult environment in China for you in the balance of the year and to next year.

Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.
Early in the second quarter two months ago, we detailed our strategy for the future of Ford.
Put simply, our Ford+ plan is focused on two things: really distinctive products that only Ford could do; and an always-on relationship and experience for our customers that get better and better over time.
We're building on our foundational strengths, our iconic products, the uniquely appealing vehicles, our manufacturing excellence, and the industry's best captive finance company, but we're now adding new capabilities and new talents and we're investing in new businesses that will accelerate our value we create for customers and our investors.
We're committed to delivering a richer experience for our Ford and Lincoln customers, one that improves over time with things like our over-the-air software upgrades, data-driven experiences, productivity and uptime services for our critical commercial customers, charging software, and a lot more.
Ford+ also means introducing the industry's most compelling high-volume electric vehicle lineup and investing the capital and human resources required to design and build world-class batteries and electric powertrain components.
And with Argo AI, we're well-positioned to launch an autonomous people and goods delivery business with significant future growth potential.
But fundamental to transforming Ford is to further strengthen our auto operations while we're also expanding our addressable market.
Our commitment is to earn your confidence with strong execution quarter after quarter, year after year, delivering solid returns regardless of the challenges that we face with external environment like we did in the second quarter.
Despite the many headwinds from the semiconductor shortage, some of which were unique to Ford, our team skillfully managed our business and we generated a positive EBIT.
And I can tell you that this outcome was far from certain at the beginning of the quarter.
It required intense focus from our team on cost, pricing, and mix.
The primary advantage we have right now is the strength of our product portfolio, and it's about to get a lot stronger.
We stopped making me-too products in declining segments a few years ago, and we unleashed our product development team to create emotional and distinctive products that only can come from Ford.
The Mustang Mach-E, which is already the second best-selling electric SUV in the United States, was recently named Car and Driver Electric Vehicle of the Year after rigorous testing against 10 other great EVs, including the Tesla Model Y Performance, the Porsche Taycan, and the Audi e-tron.
The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections.
The reservations for the F-150 Lightning have now climbed well past 120,000 units, and 75% of those customers are new to Ford.
We are now working around the clock to break constraints and increase our manufacturing capacity for these red-hot, new battery electric vehicles.
We're working with LG Chem, SKI Innovation to increase our annual battery capacity for the Mustang Mach-E by 70%, and we're taking similar actions ahead of the launches of the E-Transit later this year and the F-150 Lightning early next year.
The customer and critical reception to our new Bronco lineup has also been remarkable.
In June, we started shipments to fulfill 125,000 orders we have for Bronco two- and four-door models, and 70% of those Bronco customers are also new to Ford.
And then there's the Maverick, our upcoming hybrid pickup that offers room for five gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and is priced starting at less than $20,000.
And customers already recognize the value of this product, and the initial interest to our dealers is more than almost 80,000 orders.
Great products alone are not sufficient though to deliver Ford+.
Always-on means we are regularly interacting with our customers on things large and small, and we're building new capabilities like connected services to enrich the customer experience and drive reoccurring revenue streams.
We developed a proprietary software and hardware stack we call Blue Oval Intelligence to deliver updates to customers' vehicles over the air.
Some of our competitors can do it for their entertainment systems.
We do it for almost all of our modules in the vehicle.
For example, the Mustang Mach-E activation rates, the number of customers who opt in to connected services like FordPass, are now over 95%.
We have now updated more than 150,000 vehicles over the year just this year, and we expect this -- to top 600,000 vehicles by year end.
And by 2028, we will have 33 million OTA capability vehicles on the road around the world.
And we're mining the real-world data from these vehicles real time to better meet our customer needs.
To me, this is the most important point.
For example, driven by the vehicle data from the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 already, we've identified $50 million in efficiencies just from warranty cost avoidance and other opportunities.
We're also building out our global Ford Pro commercial business, which we expect to grow from $45 billion in 2025 from $27 billion in 2019.
Last month, we announced our acquisition of Electriphi to help accelerate electric vehicle fleet adoption by offering those customers the best-scaled depot charging experience for all commercial customers.
It's an example of how we're building out Ford Pro now.
In mobility, we are now focused on planning and executing a phased deployment of AVs that will lead to large-scale commercialization of Ford's AVs.
Last week, as you've seen, we reached the industry-first collaboration between Argo and Lyft to deploy Ford driverless vehicles on the Lyft TNC network.
This collaboration will enable commercial deployment at scale and demonstrate Ford and Argo's ability to connect into multiple TNCs, or transportation networks.
And on the technology front, Argo -- I'm really excited about this, introduced Argo Lidar, which will help us expand our autonomous services beyond the dense urban areas that most are focused on.
This new lidar, designed to be cost-effective and manufacturing at scale, will offer what we believe is the industry's longest distance-sensing range of 400 meters with dark object detection or safe highway driving.
Now before John reports on the quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year, let me give you an update on the semiconductor situation.
In April, we said we'd expect to lose about 50% of our planned volume in the second quarter, which then implied a loss in adjusted EBIT.
In fact, we did better than expected.
We leveraged the strong demand to optimize our revenue and profits.
We're seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but the situation remains fluid especially due to the delay in ramp-up of one of our key suppliers, Renesas, that Ford is uniquely exposed to in the first half.
Overall, after effectively managing through the first half, we are now spring-loaded for growth in the second half and beyond because of those red-hot products, pent-up demand, and improving chip supply.
Navigating these chip constraints has led us to make important permanent changes in our business model at Ford.
We are modernizing our go-to-market strategy.
What does that mean? We're placing a greater emphasis on build-to-order sales bank, not just low stocks.
We have learned that, yes, operating with fewer vehicles on lots is not only possible but it's better for customers, dealers, and Ford.
But we're also driving a significant increase in the number of customers configuring and ordering their vehicles online so we have better visibility to real demand using an order bank.
This allows us to lower inventories, simplify our incentives and reduce our order complexity and the industrial system's cost.
For our customers, upside is that they more quickly get the precise vehicle they want.
Now, this isn't theoretical.
I hope we get into the Q&A.
We're doing it right now as we speak.
Relative to the supply chain, we made three notable changes.
First, we are no longer relying heavily on a tiered procurement structure for transparency.
We are now engaging directly, for example, with the fabs on semiconductors and key points in the supply chain for our critical components, electronic components.
With closer relationships and more transparent exchange of information such as technology road maps, we can integrate their know-how into our designs to better align supply and demand.
Second, we are providing a longer-term forecast to critical vendors so they can better understand and accommodate our requirements.
And third, we are more comprehensively scanning for obstacles in our supply chain.
Risk mitigation actions include stockpiling of critical parts like semis, dual sourcing, and design interchangeability in the case of single sources.
These changes are all being applied to new technologies as well, including batteries, which are rapidly becoming a larger portion of our bill of material at Ford.
Our pending joint venture with SK Innovation, called Blue Oval SK, will produce EV battery cells and arrays, helping us secure supplies of batteries at competitive cost and performance levels really critical, given our demand for our new electric vehicles.
And now I'd like to turn it over to John to take us through the results for the quarter and our outlook.
"
2923,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"And we are not slowing down on modernization because of the chip situation.
In fact, we're doing the opposite.
"
2924,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"And we will not cede truck leadership to anyone.
"
2925,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Great question.
So we just launched FORDLiive, as you mentioned, in the U.K.
and Spain.
We have five more EU countries covered by the end of the year to launch.
So we're really excited about FORDLiive.
What we've committed to so far is in the next couple of years, by 2025, we expect our digital and charging revenue in Ford Pro to be about $1 billion.
Today -- I wish we had more time to focus on this frankly, we have about just under 200,000 unique subscriptions for our telematics and data services.
We grew at about 20,000 units in the core, 20,000 subscriptions in the quarter.
And we feel like that digital telematics and selling data like fuel tank information plus adding the charging services like Electriphi for depot charging for our customers are high-growth area with the revenue to that level in the next couple of years.
The monetization of FORDLiive is really around our traditional parts business, which is very high margins and we have a very low share.
So the opportunity for us, upside, is tremendous.
Post-warranty, even in our commercial customers, we get very few of those customers.
And so the real payoff for this closed-loop is going to be much higher share post-warranty of that very profitable business.
"
2926,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"One particular area of modernization that doesn't -- I don't think get enough attention in where we're investing as a company is certainly $30 billion in electrification and the vertical integration of batteries and, of course, our investment in autonomy.
I think you all know about where we're spending our money in the general categories.
But the one I really want to highlight is the very significant investment in our embedded electrical architecture upgrade.
This is really a significant move by Ford to not just invest in electrification but move those products to fully digital, updatable in all modules, and go to a fully modern, zonal electric architecture.
I'm not going to go through the details, but this is a very expensive transition but it will enable a whole new capability for the always-on experience than even today's connected vehicles like Mustang Mach-E.
And I want to highlight that because it often gets lost in the other categories of investment and modernization.
"
2927,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Yes.
Yes.
So when we talk about upgrading our electric vehicles, it's much more fundamental than just the investment in the tooling and the engineering of the electric vehicle and its components and propulsion.
It also includes a completely new approach to an embedded software and hardware system.
"
2928,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Sure.
I mean, we'll have ground stock for sure in dealers, and we obviously have to keep the vehicle fresh.
More and more of that will be the digital freshness of the vehicle.
But I would say if you look at our 60-plus thousand unit order bank in North America, a lot of -- not all of those are Broncos and Mustang Mach-Es.
We're doing this for our whole brand.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question will come from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.
"
2929,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"And just remember, in Europe, just remembering Ford of Europe, the cross-border issue in Europe is not so small.
We have holding centers and lots of ways to manage the stock.
We don't plan to implement that system in the U.S.
It evolved over time and we have one country.
So I think we can -- our intention is -- as John said, is not to handle it that way.
In China, the team has made tremendous progress from a $1.5 billion loss, hovering around breakeven now or slightly below that.
And we're in a very important time for Ford in China.
Lincoln is now profitable, and we just localized those models.
We only launched Lincoln in 2015.
I was there.
So it's a recent phenomenon.
And we're just about to launch a whole plethora of brand-new vehicles like we're doing in North America today.
So we're on the eve of the Mustang Mach-E launch, localized.
And then we have all these new vehicles, the EVOS.
I can go on a long list.
And it will be just like what we're seeing in North America, full freshness, and that will play out over the next couple of years.
So China is very important for our profit plans.
I think the team has done a tremendous job in stabilizing our sales situation and improving our cost.
And now it's going to be a growth story in China.
We're just commercializing and industrializing the vehicles as we speak.
And Mustang Mach-E is kind of the first major one.
"
2930,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yes.
It's a good question.
Generally speaking, that certainly could happen.
We don't know how the demand will shift.
Obviously, our guess is 40% of our mix, 240-gigawatt capacity by 2030.
So we're busy making all that happen, as you say.
40% is a lot higher than today.
And I think we have -- well, I know we have the right strategy for the company.
But so much of this transition is going to depend on government support, infrastructure build-out.
And we need to be patient, and I think agility will become a very important skill for the company.
So far, the first inning would imply that Ford is No.
1 in sports cars, Mustang.
We're No.
1 in vans with Transit.
We're No.
1 in pickups with F-150.
We're electrifying all three of those in the next six months.
And so far, the demand is actually higher than we expected.
So I don't know what's going to happen.
We don't know what's going to happen.
The support in China, but especially in Europe, has accelerated the BEV adoption in those regions.
But as you say, we get into the next phase of expansion with a lot more product offering and all that capital pointed at BEVs.
It's hard to say and it's hard to handicap the government's policy at a government level over time.
I think the most important thing isn't how much money we're spending because that's enough.
It is our agility and the kind of execution of our BEVs and our management of the profitability of those vehicles, and that's where we're putting our energy, the agility of our industrial system, our manufacturing, our focus on the profitability improvement, and the vertical integration for key electric components and making our vehicles different and more competitive than others.
I know it's a very general answer, but I don't think we know enough to answer your question.
"

2932,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Great question.
Put simply, what we've learned about our very large order bank for Lightning is way over-indexed on the Coast.
Almost 80% are new to Ford.
What's interesting, two out of five are people who are going to trade in an ICE pickup, which is very important because it indicates a move a little bit faster to full-size truck BEV than maybe our optimistic assumptions.
And so I would say what we've learned so far is that the customers are largely new to Ford but they aren't new to this segment.
These are customers who really like these silhouetted vehicles.
What is really interesting for me is someone would portray the full-size truck industry as kind of a conservative customer.
That's not what we're seeing.
These very large order bank for F-150 Lightning, they're new to BEV and they are excited to move to BEV.
And they are -- more than half of them are pickup truck customers.
Operator
Thank you.
[Operator instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
"
2933,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Thank you, Rod.
Put simply, we're really committed to both going to an order-based system and keeping our inventories between 50 and 60 days supply.
I've been here at Ford for 13 years.
There were many years after the financial crisis where our days supply was 20, 30, 40 days.
And in those years, the maximum retail order bank we had in the U.S.
was 1,000 to 2,000 a month.
We are now at 70,000 units on our way to 80,000 units.
That gives you the order of magnitude difference in the way we're looking at this order bank change for the company.
A lot of people in our industry are making a big deal about the move online, sure.
But for Ford, we think there's massive benefit across all stakeholders for going to an order bank system.
You put pressure on our industrial system to deliver quickly.
It reduces our dealers' costs more than just low days supply as you mentioned.
It allows us to significantly reduce our incentives.
And I guarantee you -- I don't know how much money we're wasting.
I know we're wasting money on incentives.
I just don't know where.
With an order-based system, we will have much less risk of that.
It requires us to dramatically reduce our order complexity as well.
So there are a lot of enablers that have been put in place to move us to this new system and new go-to-market approach.
I'd love to talk to you more about it, but I've tried to give you the high hard ones.
"
2934,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Yes.
A really good question.
So the team has done a lot of work on this.
I'll try to answer it very simply.
Our target is 50 to 60 days supply.
That means trucks will be a little bit higher.
We have a lot -- about a third of our truck dealers in C and D county.
Five trucks to them could be 100 days supply but they need five trucks for the local community.
And for urban and suburban dealers, it will be less than that range.
Different segments will have different targets.
We actually did this post-financial crisis for a few years and then, over time, lost discipline.
And this is quite important for this management team.
We have a weekly and a monthly operations review, where we'll look at this very carefully by segment for each of the regions.
That's the kind of soft wiring or management judgment.
Going to an order bank, I would say, is a hardwired way of reducing the stock.
And I think it's going to take both for Ford to make this transition.
It can't be just relying on management keeping within that range.
We certainly will have an exception process to go beyond that, and there will be a pretty tough discussion with our operating teams.
But I think what I'm more excited about is the hardwiring of going to an order-to-delivery order system, which actually our new launches gave us that gift because for Bronco and Mach-E and some of the other high-demand vehicles, we moved the reservation system into an order bank system.
We then realized, ""My God, why don't we do this for all the vehicles, not just those vehicles?"" And that's when we had to put a series of incentives and more policy changes, like order complexity reduction in the system, to make it kind of the way we do things at Ford.
I think it's going to require both changes.
"
2935,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Sure.
It is.
"
2936,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"Really good questions.
So it depends on the region.
Of course, we're a dominant commercial brand in multiple regions like Western Europe and the U.S., even in China in certain segments.
And we're seeing, in Europe, a very dramatic order bank on our vans.
It is something I've never seen in my career.
We're talking months and months and months of backorders.
So the demand for our commercial vehicles in Europe is extremely strong.
The order bank is months and months.
In the U.S., we're very fortunate that our commercial business is heavily focused on Transit and Super Duty.
And of course, F-150 is kind of mixed.
And so for those vehicle lines, Transit and Super Duty is very easy to -- we don't have to prioritize between retail and commercial because those vehicle lines are almost 100% commercial.
The one that's challenging for us to balance is F-150.
And as you could see in this quarter, we're very carefully mix-managing, but we are very respectful of the needs of our commercial customers.
We know where our toast is buttered.
And those customers are really important for us.
In fact, we are in discussions with them right now about the trade-off between feature content and availability.
We have many commercial customers in the U.S.
that have been waiting for months and months for the vehicle.
And we are discussing with them, ""Would you be willing to take off feature content to get your vehicles now?"" And that's -- and you can expect us to be balanced about that discussion and negotiation and compromise.
And it's -- we'll make the right call for the company and for the customer, but they are pushing us for availability now even if it means lower feature content.
"
2937,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"We don't know -- we haven't seen any --
"
2938,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"OK.
"
2939,F,2021,2,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"Great question.
Well, we're going to have a couple of different population of dealers.
We're going to have our professional dealers, and the answer is a little different for them versus our retail dealers.
We'll have our rural dealers, and the answer is a little bit different for them than the suburban urban dealers.
I would say the message we're giving to our team, our dealers is, look, we're going to have to work really carefully together because the customers are going to have a lot of questions on Ford BlueCruise, for example.
So we want to make sure the dealers are very knowledgeable about these new OTA features that are really meaningful in the use of the customer's life.
That's one.
The second one is service, service, service.
That is the most important thing for us.
It's wiring a closed loop between the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle, the service capacity of the dealers, and the customer is going to be the most important ballet we're going to have to play together with the dealers.
This is especially true for Ford Pro.
And in fact, today, we already have 160 remote trucks doing service for our commercial customers at their business, warranty work.
That's a good example of the evolution of the business model where they're taking their service department from a fixed hub and going on the road with their service capacity.
And those trucks have to be cooked into the vehicle data and the prognostics, our parts legacy system to order parts, and the dealers on dispatch system.
That has to be a closed-loop.
So all I would say to you is the orchestration and our benefit, our chance to win just like maybe targets a chance to win versus the online retailers is that in-person service, especially in professional customers.

Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a good quarter.
Inventory levels, we've never seen them at these levels obviously before, and obviously, it's impacting your market share.
Any sense of how much of that you think you could recoup and how much may -- or you're concerned may switch to other brands if people might only wait for so long?

2944,F,2021,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"I just wanted to actually follow up quickly on that.
Jim, you mentioned getting back to 50 to 60 days supply.
That sounds closer to normal than not, but you're also -- the way you're describing your order bank, it looks -- it sounds like 20% to 25% of your sales would be built-to-order horseshoes and hand grenades.
So I'm just curious how you decide where that balance lands, how you keep the inventory tight, your partners' dealership happy and selling and creating value for you.
But then also a big part of the story is the tightness in the secondary market, in the used market is keeping receipts high, which is helping the new vehicle price and it's certainly helping out at Ford Motor Credit.
So, I mean, there's kind of a seesaw effect here to get the benefit on both sides.
I just -- how do you figure out where this should land and how you actually execute on it?

And just a follow-up on that.
On current state of affairs of retail versus fleet mix, I mean, it seems like when you talk to the dealers, there's an emphasis on retail, the dealers certainly at your level.

2949,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thank you, Jim.
So first, I want to reiterate that everything we do and every decision we are making, including capital allocation, is squarely focused on delivering our Ford+ plan.
And you'll see that as I share our key takeaways from the quarter, our full-year outlook, and describe how we are positioned for even a stronger performance heading into 2022.
And as Jim said, we delivered better-than-expected results, given the semiconductor constraints.
Year over year, our automotive business improved across several key financial metrics as we overlapped the industrywide COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns we saw in the second quarter of last year.
Now for a more accurate picture of our true trajectory in this present environment, we're focusing more on sequential comparisons, and we think those are more appropriate.
While wholesales were down 28% sequentially, our teams optimized for revenue and profit with disciplined incentive spending and mix management.
We allocated chips to customer orders, new launches, and our more profitable vehicles.
In addition, the strength of our sales order bank gives us confidence in our ability to drive a more balanced performance of wholesales, revenue, and profit in the second half of this year, including sequential improvement in wholesales and share.
So let's turn to our results.
On a consolidated basis, wholesales and revenue were up 18% and 38% year over year, respectively, and we delivered adjusted EBIT of $1.1 billion with adjusted margin of 4%.
Outside of North America, our underlying trajectory continues to improve despite the impact of the semiconductors, and that's driven by more focused product portfolios, geographic footprint as well as lower costs.
And Ford Credit continued to deliver strong performance with record quarterly EBT of $1.6 billion, and that's demonstrating why it's a strategic asset and critical to enabling Ford+.
And a prime example is through the launch of a new service like Ford Pro FinSimple, which provides bundled financing for commercial vehicles, services, and EV charging.
And so it's another example of Ford Credit being a strategic weapon for us.
Now turning to the regions.
North America posted a 40% sequential decline in wholesales due to the semiconductor shortage.
Now as we manage the chip constraints, we've focused our efforts on customer or customers ordering vehicles for future delivery.
We exited the second quarter with our U.S.
customer sold order bank up more than seven times compared to a year ago.
And with new models to come, we are clearly poised for a rebound in North America when the semiconductor supply stabilizes and aligns with demand.
On a year-over-year basis, EBIT was up $1.1 billion.
Outside of North America, the turnaround of our operations remains on track.
In aggregate, EBIT improved $800 million year over year but declined sequentially, mainly driven by Europe where the semiconductor shortage caused wholesale units to drop sequentially by nearly 35%.
The transformation in Europe continues as the region capitalizes on strength in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro and a more focused passenger portfolio, including key imports.
Europe has stepped up investments in electrification, including $1 billion for a new EV manufacturing center in Cologne, the launch of our E-Transit next spring, and a new, all-electric light commercial vehicle from Romania.
In South America, our restructuring is on track.
Our lean, derisked, and asset-light business model is focused on our strengths with Ranger, Transit, and key imported vehicles.
The region introduced Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach 1 in selected markets and is preparing now for the launch of the new Transit van in the second half of this year.
In China, we continued to see improvement in key areas of focus, including Lincoln, commercial vehicles, electric vehicles, and with our portfolio of near-premium Ford vehicles.
Lincoln attained its highest-ever quarterly sales, was profitable, and also captured the No.
1 spot in J.D.
Power's luxury sales satisfaction ranking, unseating Audi, which had held the position for 11 years.
In addition, 97% of Lincoln's volume is now produced locally, and commercial vehicles now account for 52% of overall sales mix in China.
And finally, we are readying for the launch of the localized Mustang Mach-E later this year.
Our International Markets Group, we delivered another solid quarter, leveraging its portfolio strengths with Ranger pickups and Everest SUV.
And we're continuing to assess our business in India, and we'll have more to say on this later this year.
Companywide, second-quarter adjusted free cash flow was negative $5.1 billion.
As expected, semiconductor-related volume losses had a greater impact on the free cash flow than EBIT because of adverse working capital and timing differences related to customer allowances for marketing incentives.
Ford Credit did provide a partial offset with distributions of $4 billion in the quarter.
Now we expect working capital and these timing differences to normalize over time as the semiconductor supply is restored.
Cash and liquidity remained very strong, ending the quarter at $25.1 billion and $41 billion, respectively.
The strength of our balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to navigate periods of stress while also continuing to invest in growth in our Ford+ plan.
So now let's turn to the outlook.
Based on the underlying strength of our business and present assessment of the semiconductor supplies through the second half, along with other factors, we have increased our outlook for full-year adjusted EBIT to between $9 billion to $10 billion.
Now, this assumes about a 30% sequential increase in volume in our second half versus our first half, which is supported by the anticipated improvement in the supply of semiconductors.
Our guidance implies we are -- we expect second-half adjusted EBIT to be lower than the first half of the year.
And so we provided a bridge to help with this, and we've included that on Page 19 of our earnings presentation.
So let me provide a little bit of color around this.
Relative to tailwinds, we expect about $3 billion to $4 billion in favorable market factors, net of an increase in volume-related production costs for the higher volumes.
Headwinds.
Right? We see headwinds coming through, and we see pressure on contribution margin.
We expect commodities to be up almost $2 billion half over half.
Warranty costs are expected to be higher in the second half, up about $500 million, though we still expect full-year warranty expense to be down year over year.
Relative to structural costs, about $1.5 billion in investments in modernization, consistent with what we laid out in May, including customer experiences, connectivity, IT, new product launches.
Looking at Ford Credit, based on current market dynamics, we expect Ford Credit to decline by about $1 billion as auction values begin to normalize, and we also have a non-repeat of reserve releases that we had in the first half.
And lastly, we also have the nonrecurrence of the $900 million non-cash gain on Rivian we booked in the first quarter.
And it's important to note that this gain also impacts our run rate heading into 2022.
We are also increasing our full-year adjusted free cash flow target to $4 billion to $5 billion, supported by expected favorable working capital in the second half as production increases from an anticipated improvement in chip availability.
Now as our operating results improve, so does our cash conversion, which we continue to target in the range of 50% to 60%.
And the strength in cash conversion and our balance sheet provides us ample financial flexibility to invest in growth, including in EVs, Ford Pro, our connected services, and mobility.
Now looking toward 2022, we are confident in the underlying trajectory of our business and excited to see the momentum continue as we leverage one of the strongest product lineups in our history and continue to implement our Ford+ plan.
We're on a new path at Ford.
We've got a plan, the resources, and the resolve to build a better business.
So now I'll hand it over to the operator to open it up for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays.
"
2950,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Brian, thanks.
Yes.
I think the way we see it is that we've got strength in the underlying performance of our business.
As we head into 2022, we also know that the product lineup is going to get stronger.
Right? We're just launching Bronco now.
We've got F-150 Lightning next year.
We have Maverick next year.
And we also expect that we should get to more of a full line rate on our manufacturing of all our other vehicles and new vehicles that we've had this year.
So we do see strength in the product lineup heading into next year.
But what we also see heading into next year, a few headwinds.
Ford Credit, we expect that to be more normalized to our run rate that we normally see.
And that's because we see auction values coming down, and then we should see our credit reserves and our credit losses normalize as well.
We also see that next year, as volumes increase and stocks increase across the industry, we should see some pricing moderation.
Again, we also see commodities being higher next year as well.
And we're going to continue to invest in our new product portfolios.
We've got the launches coming in next year.
We've got our Ford+ plan.
So we see that continuing as we head into next year as well.
So there are some headwinds but the underlying strength of the business continues to be positive.
And with that, we see that trajectory continuing into '22 and then on our way to the 8% EBIT margin for '23.
"
2951,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yes.
So, Dan, yes, I mean, I think my guess is as good as anybody's on this.
We do see the chip issue running through this year, and we could see it bleeding into the first part of next year.
But I think we won't really have a good feel for that until later in this year.
We know that -- as we've had discussions with the fab suppliers, they're telling us they're reallocating capital.
They're increasing supply for automotive, etc.
But I think this is one of those things where we need to see the relief coming through before we can really feel comfortable that we're out of the woods here.

2953,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"No.
That was planned.
That's coming in.
Part of that is due to the launches of the vehicles.
And with the launch costs comes advertising.
But we're also investing in connectivity, the IT we need to put in place for the connectivity as well as customer experiences, digital experiences, user experiences with the vehicle.
So we're continuing to invest to build out our Ford+ plan.
"
2954,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Rod, thanks.
So in the second half, we show the net number there for the volume, net of the manufacturing production costs, and other market factors.
So what we are assuming is that in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we start to see some moderation in pricing due to the fact that we should see volumes and inventories and stocks coming up a bit.
So that is something that we do have built into that number for the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter.
And then when it comes to 2022, Bronco is just getting up and running now, launched now.
As Jim said, we have a hefty order bank there.
And then F-150 Lightning, Maverick, they're launching next year.
So our product portfolio is strong today, is going to be even stronger next year.
And so we see that contributing to the run rate as well.
So I think coming out of Capital Markets Day, we talked about the trajectory of the business, 2022 being definitely stronger than '21 as we walk toward 2023 and the 8% EBIT margin that we plan to hit.
"
2955,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yes.
Thanks, Adam.
Actually, Mach-E is profitable, contribution margin positive, and profitable on the bottom line today.
So we've seen strong demand for that, yes.
So I think when we look at it, over time, as we've talked about at Capital Markets Day and we've talked about with you, we've got to ride that technology curve down.
We've got to get to the $80 per kilowatt-hour for the battery pack before the end of the decade.
We've got to scale the BEV content.
We have commonality in the top hats and other components that will help us as well.
And then, of course, we need to build on our services and such to really improve the profitability of the BEVs as we move forward.
But I can tell you that Mach-E is profitable today.
"
2956,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Colin, it's John.
So I think what we're seeing here from a market share drop, it's completely related to the fact that our stocks reduced so much.
We have the chip issue.
We lost the volumes that we lost in the second quarter.
We expect that as we work to improve the run rate and through the third quarter, we're very focused on maintaining this high turn rate, filling the orders that we have.
As Jim said, we're going to continue to work on retail orders and continue to bring our customers along that way as well.
So we think that we have a good chance to regain that share, especially with the strong lineup that we have.
And so we see this as a temporary issue related to the chip issue and the volume and production we had in the quarter.
"
2957,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Yes.
Thanks.
I think pricing is the majority of what was behind that growth.
We had a very strong quarter relative to pricing as we saw our inventory shrink, and we see the strength in the underlying demand of the products that we have.
And so I think I would think about it more as pricing, a little bit of mix in there but more of it is pricing.
"
2958,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yes.
That's a great question.
I think we've been working and unpacking this, as you'd expect.
Well, it's a combination of all of the above, right? We have strong products.
We see continued demand for those strong products.
Supply is well short of that.
It's allowed us to continue to keep the pricing strong and improve the pricing in the second quarter versus what we had expected.
And I think as long as you see this imbalance between supply and demand, you'll continue to have stronger pricing power, as we've seen through the first quarter and the second quarter.
As we go through the year and we start to see supply and demand normalize, we'll see some of this pricing come off a little bit in the fourth quarter, and then we have to see how that runs through next year.
But given the strength of our product lineup and the demand we see, we expect to have a relatively strong pricing power for the foreseeable future.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
"
2959,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Yes.
Thanks.
Of course, as we make our capital allocations and we make these investments, we expect that we're going to get a return on them.
And that's all part of our walk-up into 2023 and the 8% margin.
We're also continuing to work on cost reductions elsewhere.
Right? These are investments that we're making in our new products with the launches and connectivity and IT.
We've got advertising in there for these launches and then, of course, customer experiences, as I talked about earlier.
But we're also driving cost reductions elsewhere as we continue to improve the business toward that 8% margin in 2023.
So we'll invest in certain areas.
We'll see costs go up in certain areas, but we should also see costs coming down in other areas, particularly material cost, etc.
"
2960,F,2021,2,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yes.
So I'll take the working capital.
Now the way we see the order bank helping us is we actually see it simplifying the industrial system because we'll know exactly what we're going to build.
So we're actually working through that now and trying to use that to simplify and reduce things like working capital.
So I think if anything, it would have the opposite impact.
It would increase working capital.
We'd use it to drive down working capital.
Then on the days supply, what we've seen in the past is around a 75-days supply.
So 50 days, it's a 25-day reduction.
So we do see that as substantial.
And of course, that will be different across the different vehicle lines.
So we do see that as a substantial pullback in the days supply.
"
2961,F,2021,2,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Good evening.
Thanks.
Thank you for squeezing me in.
First, I wanted to just ask on the chip shortage.
And I fully recognize the situation is very fluid and your crystal ball is as good as anyone else's.
But do you have a sense for how long it might take until you're no longer supply constrained on production? Is this something that's fully resolved, by your best guess, by early next year? Or do you think that there might be still some supply constraint lasting much longer and deeper into 2022? So just the baseline expectations around that.
"
2962,F,2021,2,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"Great.
Understood.
And second question is just on ICE versus BEV.
And clearly, you're deemphasizing ICE.
And presumably, that means the investment is coming down.
I assume that part of that $30 billion headline number you gave includes some reallocation from ICE to EV.
But I think we also know right now that -- and maybe this is just a function of the market, but ICE sales are extremely strong in the U.S.
It could remain the case for a while.
So what should we expect on margin for ICE vehicles especially as some of that investment comes down? Is it possible that the outgoing margin on some of the ICE vehicles actually increases and you could potentially run into a negative mix issue as we -- as you start to pivot from ICE to the BEV?
"
2963,F,2021,2,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,2,"Understood.
That's helpful nevertheless.

2965,F,2021,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,0,"I've got a couple of questions.
First, a little bit of housekeeping.
But just thinking ahead to '22, if we take the second half at a good rate of $3.5 billion but also bear in mind that your first half is typically the stronger half of the year for Ford, is there any read-through for 2022?
"
2966,F,2021,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,1,"OK.
And just a follow-up.
The $1.5 billion 2H headwind from investments in modernization, is that something new that was planned for this year but maybe back-end-loaded due to management focusing on the chip shortage, or kind of how do you think about that?
"
2967,F,2021,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,2,"OK.
And a question for Jim.
As you look at the order book for the F-150 Lightning and what's shaping up for the Bronco and the Maverick, any sense of how many of those customers are -- as you mentioned, the F-150 may be new to Ford but also may be new to that segment.
So for example, SUV buyers migrating to the Lightning due to the storage or the bidirectional charging and other features.
"
2968,F,2021,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,3,
2969,F,2021,2,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Thanks for taking my question.
One thing that especially stood out in your results, I think, is on Slide 6 where it shows that units wholesaled in the quarter rose 18% year over year, but that revenue was up by more than twice as much by 38%.
So just a few questions around pricing and overall revenue per unit.
I can see from the global walk on Slide 9 that net pricing helped EBIT by $1.9 billion or kind of like 10% of last year's revenue, which seems to suggest of the idea that like half of the growth in revenue over unit volume in 2Q was driven by price and the other half by mix.
Is that roughly correct? And what do you think the outlook is for continuing to grow revenue in excess of the change in volume?
"
2970,F,2021,2,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,"OK.
Very helpful.
And then just as a follow-up, we saw some estimates that your incentive spending in June in the U.S., it may have fallen like 50% year over year, leading the decline in industrywide incentives.
I'm curious how much of the decline in incentives do you think may be driven by hot new products like the F-150, Bronco, Bronco Sport, Mach-E, etc., versus how much is a function of the low inventory environment or maybe just a general inflationary environment.
And to that end, it might be helpful to know if carryover pricing, which I think usually declines year-over-year, if that might also be tracking stronger and what your outlook is for incentive spending going forward maybe in light of some of the comments you made earlier on the call about inventories and order bank, etc.

2972,F,2021,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Thanks.
Good afternoon.
I wanted to get back to the investments in modernization and maybe frame that in the context of a 2023 view you laid out at the Capital Markets Day.
Like how does that investment trend through those years as you think about the margin targets you laid out? And is there an assumption that by the time you get to '23 or maybe a little bit later, there's a return on that investment such that it becomes a neutral or even positive to the margin?
"
2973,F,2021,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"OK.
So just to clarify, so the EV spend is included in that bucket that you mentioned?
"
2974,F,2021,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,2,"OK.
And just -- and going back to the order bank, which is clearly interesting, like that's -- it seems like an easier task, quite frankly, when you have great product like you do with the Bronco, the Mach-E, and the Lightning, which are -- seem well-received and also limited.
I guess what I'm wondering is, how are you going to sort of balance that with inventory as you sort of think about like an Edge or an Explorer in year four or five of its product life cycle? Like is the plan to still keep inventories of the older product or a more mature product tight such that you can still get some into the order bank? Or are there other plans to keep that product fresh throughout the life cycle that can lead people to order?

Operational excellence, especially in this crisis requires obviously the dedication, but also collaboration, partnership, and support from the entire enterprise, our suppliers, our dealers, employees, unions, our JV partners.
And our execution and this excellence demonstrated this early on in China, as Jim said.
I know we're going to come out of this a lot stronger, but we need to be agile, have a bias towards action and be very transparent with our employees, our customers and partners.
Early on in China, we focused on business continuity.
We mapped our suppliers for the liquidity in the supply chain.
We create unique logistics portal to track our supply chain.
We secured air freight capacity to deliver critical safety equipment to our team in China, importantly including our dealers and we used the same air capacity to ensure supply of critical parts to regions like North America outside of China.
We then partnered closely with our dealers.
We tracked in-store traffic, inventory, their financial liquidity and health.
And in the phase shuttering our dealerships, we turned together, –[Technical Issues], to drive demand and ensure quality service to our customers.
We provided those customers with a more robust app to order vehicles online.
In fact in China today over a third of our sales are now direct online.
We increased doorstep delivery of sanitized vehicles with what we called zero touch.
We quickly expanded to schedule remote service and vehicle pickup for maintenance, to make it easy for customers.
And our joint venture partners were up and running as early as February, 10.
In fact, as Jim said, one of them, JMC repurposed our 2 ton transit van to manufacture over 1500 Ford Transit ambulances in the first quarter.
From the start, we focused on a return to work protocol for our Chinese business and that involved governance like reworking manufacturing safety requirements and restructuring a lot of jobs inside our facilities to ensure we can protect distancing.
This protocol, is being extended to Europe.
And will also be used when we restart our operations around the world.
We call it our playbook.
In addition to those accomplishments, our China team also quickly honed in on costs.
In the face of significant demand disruption, Ford China delivered year-over-year improvements in both contribution and structural costs.
Actually, they got close to their initial EBIT target for the quarter, offsetting all the COVID impacts.
The actions we took in China became best practice for us, part of our playbook and we tackle -- as we tackle the virus globally, protecting our people and limiting the spread of the virus as Jim described.
I have been in this industry 30 years, I have been at Ford at 13, I've seen a lot of wonderful leadership even in '08 -- especially in '08 and '09.
But I have never seen what's happened at forward over the last weeks.
Countless acts of leadership throughout every level of the organization, replicated and added to the success we realized in China.
Power of Ford, it is in our DNA and we're proud to share that with that capability for many other people.
The stark reality of a protracted global shutdown of our sector and our vertical has forced laser focus on cost and liquidity.
And just as we did in China, we have ratcheted down spending across the board, both fixed and variable.
To ensure we come out of this stronger, we protected our cycle plan, our launches, and our technology roadmaps, including connectivity.
We believe this pandemic could affect our customers live and work for many years to come, with the zero touch now as an integral part of their lives going forward, perhaps spurring on even more interest in adoption of autonomy, especially goods delivery and micro mobility.
While the effects of the virus may cause some shifts in timing, we are really excited about our forthcoming launch of the redesigned F-150.
It's the anchor of our F-Series brand, it is America's best-selling vehicle for 43 years and the launch will feature the first ever hybrid electric F-150.
We are also revealing a new Bronco brands.
We're going to continue our launch of 30 market specific Ford and Lincoln vehicles in China over the next three years, 10 of which will be electric.
We're going to offer electrified versions of the Lincoln Corsair and the Ford Escape and Kuga, which is now in launch in China and in Europe.
We're going to continue preparations for the much anticipated return of the legendary Ford Bronco next year.
And shortly after I began my new role in February, I did a two day deep dive with the automotive leadership team.
Where we really were? And how we were going to address the task and opportunities ahead.
And from the start, I was not only impressed with the diversity of skills and knowledge of our team, but the look in their eye and the desire and accountability to take on those opportunities and move the company forward.
Together, we came up out of the simple frame.
We have a few things to fix and accelerate and we need a growth plan for the company.
The recent challenges presented by the virus, have just amplified our commitment to these three areas.
There is no grace period for transforming Ford.
Two weeks ago, we announced the reorganization that will allow us to better execute against those things that we need to fix and accelerate, and to establish our growth initiatives.
We empowered a talented and diverse group of leaders, from inside but also from outside of Ford to drive transformation into high growth, high margin businesses.
Among the changes, Kumar Galhotra, who has been President, North America will take on expanded role for South America and IMG markets as well.
Lisa Drake, a seasoned executive in our industrial system was named Chief Operating Officer for North America and remains Vice President of Global Purchasing.
She will be laser focused on our launches, our cost in our industrial system in North America.
Gil Gur Arie, who has a distinguished career in Israeli military intelligence core, has joined Ford as Chief Global Data Insights and Analytics.
And Ted Cannis, whose team developed the revolutionary Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 battery-electric, was appointed General Manager Commercial Vehicles.
Now these leadership changes were specifically aimed at sharpening our focus on product and launch execution, fully leveraging smart connected vehicles and big data to serve our customers and the company, to improve our quality, and lower our costs and creating a dedicated commercial vehicle business in the US and Canada.
I'm confident this new structure will facilitate a much faster enterprise decision making and further efficiencies.
I want to assure you that the same commitment and excellence, we displayed to overcome COVID-19 are what we are leveraging as we bring Ford's manufacturing and salary population back online and turn our attention toward launching those incredible new Fords and our winning portfolio.
Over to Tim.

2977,F,2020,1,"james-d.-farley,-jr. -- chief-operating-officer",none,False,1,"Thanks, Jim.
And hi, John.
So, in China we learned a lot, not only to start up the operation safely, we started in mid-February, we're now up to 90% of our salary workforce in all of our plants are up and running.
Actually GMC never shut down, they had their best quarter ever.
But they get after costs really quickly.
We will be able to offset all of the COVID impact in the first quarter and we learned a lot.
We learned that the mix coming out is very different than the mix going in and so our mix of product is quite different.
It's very favorable.
We went online for our sales.
About a third of our sales are now online in North America, it's north of 25% that's an efficiency and improvement in our fitness.
We did lower cost.
We expect that to -- some of that to flow obviously in North America.
Very focused on the recovery items on material cost and warranty cost, those are the kind of cost that flow into subsequent years.
In fact, we are more than committed ever in that 10% EBIT margin in North America.
And we're -- as Tim said, we're forecasting a lower SAAR so that must mean, obviously our costs are going down.
We do have some great launches coming up, which will be a tailwind in North America.
The other things we learned in China that we're exporting is the shift patterns.
As you come back, are very important.
So we're getting the launch teams in the facilities to work the launches, because we're, we're just in here in China launching Kuga and localizing some of our larger SUVs.
Those are very important for our profitability, very same kind of exercise we're doing in North America in third quarter and fourth quarter.
And the last one is supplier readiness.
What we learned in China was you got to make sure your supply base is ready.
So we surveyed almost 1500 suppliers in Western Europe and the US to make sure they're ready to come up and have the same playbook in terms of prioritization of safety.
So yeah, I mean, the bottom line is, it's a very difficult time, but the Ford team is at its best and we're going after costs that will flow.
Thanks.
Back to you Jim.

2978,F,2020,1,"james-d.-farley,-jr. -- chief-operating-officer",none,False,2,"Got it.
Thanks, Jim.
Hi, Rod.
Very quickly just want to emphasize that the EU and South America restructuring are no regrets move, we reduced the headcount in Europe by 12,000 people teammates, by the end of this year.
We closed facilities, Bridgend still to come.
We've cut costs, especially structural costs in South America, we have 40% less staff.
We've got now the Fiesta and Focus, we got out of the heavy truck business, consolidated Sao Bernardo.
So those are no regrets move, but the hangover COVID is obvious.
And everything's on the table.
Our team under -- owns the plan.
It's theirs to lock down and execute.
In North America, we see a lot of opportunity and we want to make sure we have the capital to invest in North America.
We do see a way to 10% EBIT in a lower industry, even with the flow-through of the cost actions we're taking plus, as Jim said, those great new products.
And really for my team, they want to make sure that we have room for growth, especially in North America.
And so that's why we're going to look at all the operations critically.
Thanks.

Hi Joe, how are you? So good observation.
So let me talk about what was in the quarter and what was not in the quarter and then talk about the forward quarter.
So in the quarter was credit loss reserve changes for the retail loan book and for our commercial lending, as well as credit loss estimates on the lease book, which actually flows through lease accounting, as well as a reduced valuation on those vehicles that were just off lease and awaiting sale at auction.
You correctly pointed out that in the period was not included any changes and outlook on future auction values of the portfolio.
Those changes in auction values will flow through the future periods according to lease accounting and we described this in great detail in some of our educational disclosures that we have on the topic.
We're not going to disclose today, we're giving guidance on what we think that will be in the future.
It's still too uncertain.
As Tim said, we don't know the depth of -- for how long the auction market will be disruptive, but we are very confident that the used vehicle market will return to normal.
And then on dividends, the only thing I would say is that they are function of net income and balance sheet size and leverage.
And it will be what it will be.
We're still continuing to target an eight to nine leverage.
Thank you, Jim.

Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's second quarter earnings call.
Consistent with social distancing, speakers today are connected from different locations.
So in advance, I appreciate your patience including any latency as we answer questions.
I also personally hope that you and all of your loved ones are safe.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; Jim Farley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer.
Also joining us is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our results and how we are putting people first through this pandemic, including our team members, customers, and partners.
Jim Farley will cover the operational excellence required to execute solutions while ensuring Ford comes out of this even stronger.
And Tim will talk about the prudent and proactive actions we are taking to enhance our cash position while preserving the financial flexibility to fund our redesign and growth initiatives, including critical launches.
Then we'll turn the call to Q&A and Jim will close with a few remarks.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations.
Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 23 of our deck.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.
Company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow, are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume weighted basis.
Now let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.

It's just over a year since I came to Ford.
The primary reason I joined was my belief the company has abundant opportunities to improve customer experience, enhance effectiveness, grow, and create superior value for stakeholders.
Being a part of this team, as we've tackled the crisis, has further strengthened my confidence in our team, and in Ford's future.
That's why throughout our comments on this call, even amid what we are doing to protect people from the virus and help stop its spread, our actions have been consistent with the priorities we've discussed with you for several quarters.
First, improving customer experience and operational execution.
Second, progressing our global redesign, making tough choices to lay the foundation for improvement in future automotive growth, free cash flow, profitability and returns on capital.
Third, enhancing fitness, including structural cost and capital efficiency and alliances that can drive durable scale benefit.
Fourth, prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable long-term growth in mobility.
And fifth, employing continued discipline to drive strong results from Ford Credit.
In the first quarter, lower industry volumes across all regions contributed to a 21% decline in wholesales and a 15% decrease in revenue.
These results largely drove an adjusted EBIT loss of $0.6 billion and a negative $2.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow.
Our results were constrained by the adverse impacts of the virus.
We estimate the unfavorable impact to adjusted EBIT was at least $2 billion.
In our Automotive business, lower volume accounted for $177 million loss in EBIT, as $346 million in positive EBIT from North America was more than offset by losses in other markets.
To be helpful, and inform on your input, Slide 10 of our deck includes additional color on the drivers of the year-over-year change in EBIT, including warranty, which was higher by $0.5 billion and structural costs, which were lower by $0.3 billion.
Looking at the business in more detail and provide some color on why.
Up until the middle of the quarter, we were on track to meet or exceed our initial EBIT guidance for the first quarter, supported by improved product mix and the benefits of our global redesign.
In North America, while top and bottom line metrics were negatively affected by the decline in units, both revenue and EBIT did benefit from better mix, especially F-Series and Explorer.
This improvement reflects a more disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is focused on investments around the globe on our franchise strengths.
This includes our upcoming launches of our all-new F-150 and three products that are new to the market, a small rugged off road utility, Mustang Mach-E and Bronco.
We will be able to update you on launch timing, once we have a better understanding of our operational readiness as we bring our manufacturing back up.
EBIT was also negatively affected year-over-year by increased warranty costs as we roll forward higher accrual rates from the second half of last year.
We also absorbed higher material costs for new models during the quarter.
In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 13% and 21% respectively.
In addition to the lower volume, revenue was also influenced by weaker currencies, which are only partially offset by higher net pricing.
Importantly, we narrowed our EBIT loss in the region to $0.1 billion, a 29% year-over-year improvement and our strongest performance since 2013.
EBIT results do favorably reflect benefits from our global redesign, including exiting heavy truck production, discontinuing certain passenger vehicles and reducing headcount as we migrate to a lower cost asset light footprint.
In Europe, wholesales and revenue were down 25% and 16% respectively.
In addition to the virus, wholesales were also weighed down by the timing of our all-new Kuga, which followed a normal launch curve.
We're also absorbing the effects of our decision to discontinue low-margin products as we focus our portfolio on industry leading commercial vehicles.
And more selective range of passenger vehicles and selected imports.
All new vehicles this year include Kuga, Puma, and Explorer SUVs, which should get -- which together will drive an increase in our mix of SUVs year-over-year.
The decline in volume also reduced EBIT, which was down $0.2 billion year-over-year.
As expected the region absorbed higher material costs to support compliance with new CO2 regulations.
The favorable shift in our European product portfolio, which we expect to continue once we restart production, supported higher net pricing and the benefits of global redesign actions continue to drive down structural costs.
We're on track to complete the balance of our headcount reductions, about 10,000 by year-end.
China was at the forefront of the crisis.
Our team did a great job mitigating the negative effects of the virus on our customers, other stakeholders and on our business results.
Both wholesales and revenue were down about 30%.
New product launches including Escape and Corsair, and faster improvement in sales relative to the market contributed to a 10 basis point improvement in share to 2.2%.
Explorer and Aviator are on track to launch this year.
It should be important additions to our China portfolio.
Our China EBIT loss of $0.2 billion, was down $0.1 billion year-over-year as lower volume and adverse exchange were partially offset by improvement in structural cost.
Losses on mobility continue to reflect strategic investments in future growth opportunities in mobility services and vehicle and business model development for our autonomous vehicle platform.
Ford Credit delivered EBT of $30 million in the quarter, down $771 million year-over-year.
Portfolio performance was strong in the first quarter and delinquencies and charge-offs remained at low levels.
However, the results include COVID-19 related accruals of about $700 million.
The most significant of which is for future credit losses as well as lower auction values for off-lease units awaiting sale at auction.
Lease share remain below industry average and off lease auction values performed better than expected, up 1% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially.
At present most vehicle auctions in the US are closed.
Sales volume is very low and prices are disruptive.
As vehicle auctions reopen, we expect market prices to be disruptive for some period and it's difficult to say how badly or for how many months.
However, do expect used vehicle markets to normalize over time.
Managed receivables of $147 billion at quarter-end were $9 billion lower year-over-year and $5 billion lower at year-end.
At the end of the first quarter, Ford Credit had $28 billion in liquidity, which remains above target.
And Ford Credit has access to diverse funding sources to continue providing financing in the future.
Ford Credit’s balance sheet is strong with ample liquidity.
And importantly funding structure is self-liquidating.
This means that Ford Credit generates liquidity, which reduces its fund requirements as balance sheet shrinks with lower automotive sales.
Ford Credit is an important source of support for customers and dealers during this crisis.
And Ford Credit remains an important strategic asset.
Now let me turn to Automotive liquidity, and provide a little more color on some of the strategic actions we've taken since March to provide additional flexibility during this challenging time.
In March, we suspended our regular dividend, which equates to $2.4 billion per year.
We also suspended our anti-dilutive share repurchase program, which is $0.2 billion last year.
At the same time, we drew down over $15 billion under our corporate and supplemental credit facilities to bring cash on the balance sheet and provide greater certainty.
Finally, last week we completed an $8 billion opportunistic unsecured issuance, to further improve our cash and liquidity profile while most of our global operations remains shutdown.
As of April 24, our cash balance was strong at $35 billion, an amount we believe is sufficient to take us through year-end, with no additional wholesales.
Our plan though, as we announced today about Europe, is to begin a phased restart in the second quarter as we plan to have wholesales much sooner than the end of the year.
Relative to working capital, just like most other OEMs, there are two phases of cash outflow after a halt in production.
For us, this began in late March.
The first phase is more severe and is driven by about a 45 day run off in supplier payables.
We have about $13 billion of production supplier payables after late March production suspension, which will run off by early May.
While this number can move around during the year depending on scheduled plant shutdowns and other factors, it's a good approximation of the production payable number.
The second phase is post run off, after production payables have been extinguished.
Once this happens, our cash outflow dropped substantially.
Our ongoing payments, which were fairly consistent, include structural cost and warranty and vehicle incentive payments.
Once production starts, there is an inherent cash flow leverage.
Once even modest wholesales resume, our cash flow dynamics will improve driven by the restoration of supplier payables and for the large part immediate payment of vehicles upon wholesale.
We’re also thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations and looking for opportunities to preserve cash, lower operating costs, improve fitness, and drive our business to amplify our long-term potential.
These include reductions in capital spending, deferring or eliminating non-essential expenditures across our business, and deferring executive compensation.
The incremental cash from these and other actions provide additional flexibility as we navigate this challenging environment.
For example, this year we expect capex to be $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, down by about $0.5 billion compared with our February guidance and $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion lower than last year.
Turning to our outlook.
In mid-March, we withdrew our financial guidance for 2020.
As a reminder, when we gave you our outlook in early February, we said it excluded impacts of COVID-19.
Today, unfortunately the economic environment remains too uncertain to provide updated guidance for the year.
However, assuming in the second quarter we restart production in a phased way, we believe we will see the largest impact in this crisis in the second quarter, as industry volumes continue to be down significantly in every region year-over-year.
As a result, we believe adjusted second quarter EBIT will be a loss of more than $5 billion.
The recovery actions we've taken and are working on are in the billions, but we know we will not be able to recover everything or make up all of the lost volume.
Lower industry volume will be our biggest headwind this year and any mix in net pricing benefit we may realize from our global focus on franchise strengths, including exiting lower margin products, full-year impact of Explorer launched in 2019 and new launches such as F-150 slated for later this year will be overshadowed by the negative impact of lower industry volume.
And relative to structural costs, we expect favorability year-over-year driven by actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and our ongoing fitness actions.
Before we turn it over to Q&A, let me close with, we remain committed to a strong balance sheet and doing what is right to preserve our future, which is why we've been proactive in charting our course and maximizing liquidity during this uniquely uncertain time.
Our recent actions provide flexibility to weather the present disruption caused by COVID-19 and the confidence to continue to invest in growth opportunities.
We have a strong bias for action, improve our customer experience, operational execution, and drive our financial performance, including free cash flow generation over time.
I'm optimistic, we'll be better positioned than ever on the other side of this to achieve our long-term potential.

Thank you.

And thanks Emmanuel.
So as it relates to the restructuring.
The charges and the cash for 2020 that we commented on of $0.7 billion to $1.2 billion are associated with the redesign actions that have been announced.
And cumulative of that will be $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion in charges on the way to up to $11 billion as we've talked about.
And the cash would be $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion cumulative all the way up to $7 billion over time.
So to the extent that we are thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations, identify as always opportunities to improve our fitness and redesign the business to amplify our long-term potential.
That's why we give the longer-term view of the $11 billion -- up to $11 billion EBIT and up to $7 billion cash, but specific amounts we're guiding to are related to actions we've announced thus far.

It's really great to hear from all of you.
It is going to be tough to stick to one question, but I will.
Typically out of a very tough time like this, you get a very good recovery, because a lot of the lessons learned in the tough times result in sort of real efficiency and focus.
I'm just curious, I mean, Jim, you were kind of talking to this and Tim you were talking about this on the balance sheet side.
Just curious if you can really kind of illustrate or kind of explain any of those opportunities you're seeing here in the near term specifically.
And because you're kind of going through this rolling restart with China, and in Europe, and North America, you're seeing some of these opportunities already.
If you can give us more details around that, so we can understand that because traditionally one to three years out, your margins are significantly higher and in some cases, you know in the past recession, they were at all time high three years after the -- we hit the skid in '09.
So just trying to understand what you're seeing right now and what the opportunities are in China, Europe, and ultimately in North America.

Maybe just one quick one on Ford Credit.
I understand you certainly took the writedown of vehicles awaiting auction.
I believe the way it works is, you've got to also take the supplemental depreciation for the remaining term for the rest of the book.
So how should we think about that over the course of the year? And then are you still expecting Ford Credit to dividend anything back to the Motor Company this year?

2991,F,2020,1,jim-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn and hello everyone.
And Lynn, let me thank you for doing an incredible job in putting this virtual call together.
In addition to Jim Farley, our Chief Operating Officer and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer, I'm proud to say that Rudy and Ozzy, my two beagles are joining me today in the call.
Well, you know, the nature of times brings to mind the notion of paradox.
And I'd like to think of the definition of a paradox as two truths that compete.
Let me explain.
The first truth is that safety is of the utmost concern in a pandemic, yours, your loved ones and the people you work with, the communities you live in, and amazingly all other humans you interact with.
Their safety guarantees your safety.
The second truth there is no future, if we don't have an economic system that is always on.
We didn't realize there was an off switch.
We knew it might go into a recession, more like a dimmer switch, but off.
Well, now as we bring these two truths together, they compete.
Turning the economy back on challenges the question whether it's safe enough.
My goal today is to provide an update on where Ford stands and hopefully illustrate that Ford is doing a great job of managing this paradox and confirm that we have control of the business in a very difficult time.
I am pleased to report to you that we have the foresight to move early, ahead of the shutdown.
We kicked off our coronavirus response taskforce led by about 30 senior leaders from across the company.
Independent of the virus, recall we had around the same time reorganized our top team enabled by a new Chief Operating Officer position held by Jim Farley.
Candidly, this now looks quite prescient as Jim, in his new role was able to quickly marshal our operating team to focus quickly on the most important actions.
Minutes that led to hours made a huge difference in our responsiveness.
We went from a 1,000 people who work remotely from home to more than 60,000.
And we've had terrific productivity in the face of this unforeseen challenge, including our team in China which preceded the economic closure around the world.
Jim will talk more about that in a moment.
Now as we approach this challenge, we laid out three clear priorities underpinned by what we would say are Ford values.
First, undeniably, we have to protect the safety of our people and do our part to limit the spread of the virus.
Second, to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to front line workers and patients while taking care of customers, dealers and communities in which we live.
And three, skillfully manage our business through the crisis, safeguarding what we believe is a very bright future for Ford Motor Company.
I have found it is true that Ford people are at their best in tough times.
It was true when Ford was building aircraft and arms that form the arsenal of democracy in World War II.
And it was true just a short decade ago when we rallied to avoid bankruptcy and a government bailout and we emerged from the Great Recession a stronger company.
I want to confirm, it's certainly been true today.
Let me take you through a bit more detail on those three priorities.
As I said, the first priority was to protect our people and do our part to limit the spread of this virus.
So in mid-March, we were among the earliest company -- the early companies in -- to instruct the vast majority of our employees to work remotely.
We also partnered with the UAW and other automakers to introduce new safety protections in our factories and warehouses and then to shutdown those facilities worldwide.
In an illustration of the arc of a global pandemic, these actions were taken even as we were cautiously restarting operations with our joint venture partners in China.
Sadly though, in the face of this, Ford has not been immune from the ravages of the virus.
We've lost 11 colleagues in the US and UK to this pandemic.
Our second priority was to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to frontline workers and patients.
I couldn't have been more proud of our organization.
The bottom line though is when society needs you, you answer the call.
In this case, we're doing that in many countries that Ford calls its home.
Ford has always been a family business, from the generations of leadership to the generations of the proud employees.
And with that, we believe comes a special responsibility to take care of each other and this pandemic of course is no different.
In fact it requires that in spades.
We know this devastating crisis will come to an end, but in the meanwhile, we're doing everything we can to help.
As we suspended, a large portion of our work on designing and building great vehicles, we rallied to begin producing vitally needed personal protection in medical equipment.
Around the globe, our people, including the UAW partners, as I said amaze me every day, as they engineer and produce hundreds of ambulances and up to 100,000 respirators for healthcare professionals with 3M, more than 8 million face shields so far, 50,000 patient ventilators with GE Healthcare and about one million face mask, more like surgical masks every day.
And up to now 100,000 washable isolation gowns per week with Joyson Safety Systems.
Putting people first also means though taking care of our customers.
We announced refined payments on new vehicles and a better online experience for customers.
No contact vehicle delivery and service including disinfected products and roadside and other services through the FordPass app.
We also worked quickly to take care of our dealers, with digital marketing, sales and service tools, and advice on managing liquidity, as you know the government instituted a program that dealers could qualify for to enable them to keep their organizations intact.
And taking care of our communities, with millions of dollars in contributions of vehicles in cash.
The third priority, which will be the bulk of our call today was to skillfully manage our business through the crisis.
One of the rallying cries for us through all of this, just as it was in a '08 and '09 is not that -- sorry, is that we must not only weather the crises, we need to emerge from it ready to build a brighter future.
So yes, even though we took measures to preserve cash, we are moving forward on our creating tomorrow together plan.
You can ask me about that and we're totally committed to it.
This is going to leverage fresh new portfolio of vehicles, a commitment to autonomy and electrification along with connectivity, global partnerships that are -- look prescient as well that they've started before this pandemic and they're going to serve -- service in the future, including Rivian because we've gotten questions about that.
And a better customer experience.
In a moment, Jim Farley will provide more detail on the progress we're making in our underlying business during the crisis.
I'm really proud of him and he is – he’s just worked around the clock, frankly.
And so to say, it's been a 24x7 effort is not an exaggeration.
At the same time, we're pulling every appropriate lever to protect our core business, strengthen the balance sheet.
Tim Stone, also working around the clock to make sure that the company led in this initiative and bolster our cash to optimize our financial flexibility.
I'm proud that we have that all in place, before the first quarter was over.
Part of skillfully managing through this crisis, is having a well thought out protocol though for back-to-work.
We did this for China and I'm pleased that earlier today we announced we will restart our European manufacturing production with enhanced employee protection protocols in place.
It’s taking a phased approach starting on May 4.
We will restart vehicle and the engine production at most of our sites in Continental Europe and there'll be a gradual ramp up over the next few months before full production is resumed globally.
But still, there is no denying the negative economic consequences of a pandemic.
In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow was negative by $2.2 billion.
Revenue, amazingly was still $34 billion and we incurred of course an EBIT loss of around $0.6 billion.
In fact, heading towards the middle of the quarter, listen to this, we were on track to meet or exceed our original guidance for adjusted EBIT in the quarter.
Well, as I said earlier, be assured that everyone at Ford is squarely focused on both today and our future.
We believe it remains bright and it's a great source of motivation for us as we serve that future and of course take care of all these immediate needs.
Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Farley.
Jim?
"
2992,F,2020,1,jim-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,1,"Thank you, John.
Jim Hackett, I'm going to, for all the questioners I will quarterback the call so that we don't have big lag here.
And John, just an observation that I agree with you.
This is my third crisis in business, this one is a unique one.
The other two were substantial and I observe that there is cost that comes, that’s added to income statement that comes from disruption.
For example, we were shipping product, expediting product from China to get to the factories here, parts I should say, so that we didn't have any disruption.
And as the virus spread like a water slick, the stuff that we are airfreighting was eventually going to get stopped in production.
So we have the cost of that and it's what Tim has talked about that we've been working to offset those kinds of increased costs.
And there is a lot of examples of that.
It's in the billions that we've worked to.
Also confirming with you that in this time of focus, you start to think of things that matter to the company.
I don't want you to think of -- you should have stopped them anyways.
These are things that there is no race is going on.
So some of the investments that you would have because the virus has diminished participation and things we don't have that cost.
So we have the savings there.
And then having the focus that Jim Farley talked about, we find that we can actually improve our leverage.
So I want to confirm with you that, yeah, we're thinking about this, the same way.
Now you asked for some specifics and I'd like to turn it over to Jim because I think China is a good example of where there was advantage as we came out of this.
Jim?
"
2993,F,2020,1,jim-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,2,"Yes, thank you.
Thank you callers.
I'd mentioned this represents the third meta-level crisis, I've been involved with as a CEO and yes this not -- this one not only tragically has had a larger human toll, it also represents a first where for all intents and purposes, the economy was turned off.
In the face of all these events, I have been able to pay witness to those who rise to be better and likely surprise you with their resourcefulness, selflessness, and ultimately resilience.
Companies too define themselves in the times of crisis.
We hope that we've been able to talk to you why we think you're seeing Ford at its best as we protected our people and we did all we can to serve our fellow man and we believe we safeguarded the bright future of Ford Motor Company.
We look forward to sharing more of our response and the idea that you've asked about and impact as it will be lingering effects of the virus until it's totally contained.
With that, we're all adjourned and thank you for joining us tonight.

Our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
"
2996,F,2020,1,jim-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,5,"Thank you, Rod.
It's Jim Hackett.
Let me start with saying to you that 26 years in the job like this, I never had a business plan that was called pandemic.
So, and I mean that in all, you know, sincerity because we just never imagined the economy turning off and the other two crisis that I was in, we had deep troughs of issues, but this was unique.
Secondly, Ford has been really diligent and working on a number of fronts, that I'm proud to tell you, as I look back at other companies, which I would admire in our industry that some of you reference, and I take the beginning point of when I guess they started and where they are now, I would say that our -- the effort to get all the new products in the portfolio are going to be extraordinarily beneficial to the company.
You just got to remember, we are going from one of the oldest product lines to the new and in the course of this a pandemic comes in and kind of interrupt and it's going to slide, the timing of that, but we've got a new F-150, we've got a new small rugged off-road SUV, we've got an all-new Bronco, we got the Mustang Mach-E.
So all the work on that before the pandemic is value that we're going to enjoy.
This is why we believed we thought last year was going to be the tunnel year and we had the problems in Chicago, we've totally fixed that, Explorer was doing really well.
And now we were waiting for this new product.
The second thing is we started on restructuring, particularly in Europe.
Just want to comment, again I'm not being cynical, but that was 40 years of problems that we took on in a very short time.
We actually sped up the commitment for restructuring, Bob Shanks and I had one plan, we turned up the vitality of it, we spent ahead, we actually borrowed money to match the kind of returns we were going to get and it all worked down.
We're not done there, I'll let Jim in a minute and explain what's going on.
We initiated a redesign and I don't know whether that's sunk in, but we took over 25% of the management out of the company in advance of what we didn't expect, which is a pandemic although we thought a recession was in the offing, many of you said this is the longest expansion.
Well we were getting ready for that.
So that's serving us well.
And in fact, the way the team is working now with the recent management change I made, it is moving much faster with much more clarity.
So I just want to confirm that the only thing that I would witness with you is I didn't expect China to be a problem in the last 2.5 years the way it turned out to be, but I now feel that there was more problems there than just what Ford enjoyed.
And now the work we did earlier to start getting things turned around, we actually are feeling confident that China is actually the picture there is going to improve, particularly with the emphasis that we put on to get the product right in that market.
It wasn't right, which is the gestation period for getting all that flipped around, is not the kind of thing that happens in the course of 90 days or six months, but that's not asking you to wait longer, it's just saying that, if you're inpatient about all the stuff we've done and why aren't we seeing the value, I'm trying to portray to you they are synchronous and they will yield that, but I didn't expect the pandemic.
So, Jim Farley, let me just tie this back to you and let you add virtue in terms of the way you see the restructuring in -- in Europe.
"
2997,F,2020,1,jim-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,6,"Yeah, Rod.
And just to confirm the -- there is not, there is that one truth, right, don't waste a crisis.
So I want to confirm to you that the attitude and the spirit is if we can speed things up or we can -- we can now have what I would say more productive discussions with social plans or governments, of course, all that's on the table in the kinds of things that we would be working on, but nothing to announce today.
"
2998,F,2020,1,jim-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,7,"Emmanuel, confirming I can hear you.
Thanks.
"
2999,F,2020,1,jim-hackett -- president-and-chief-executive-officer,none,False,8,"Yeah, well, I guess the -- the confirmation I want to make is, yes your instincts are that there can be more, that can be done.
We're talking about, I’d just – to draw the parallel to you, in 14 days we got a ventilator designed and built for the country.
So I know Ford can move really fast.
And the pandemic, we sent everybody home on March 13.
So I don't know if you're asking in that time, you would have expected a plan that would change the strategy of the company.
The way I think about the crisis is you got a priority first of stabilizing that you can operate and recover some of the costs that are just flying out the door and that's where we did a really great job.
In parallel, we have begun planning and discussions with the spirit of don't waste the crisis and I just confirm, there's nothing to announce to you today, but would not be fair for you to walk away and say Ford is not doing anything.
I don't think that would be right.
And I'd like to clear up what you just asked about the budgets.
I'm going to turn to Tim to make sure we're -- you are reading correctly, the way the cash flows are working given that we had the roll off of the payables and what we have committed to restructuring.

I was actually hoping to ask yet another follow-up on the restructuring plan.
So I hear you loud and clear, no grace period to fix Ford, don't waste a crisis.
That's only not just the right attitude, obviously it's very much needed, especially if the industry doesn't recover to previous levels anytime soon.
At the same time, I'm a little bit struggling with, I guess the budget set for restructuring that you have for this year, which remains pretty minimal, was actually tweaked down a little bit even versus the last update.
And I view it somewhat as inconsistent.
So what is -- why can't you do more, why can't you spend more? You've raised recently another $8 billion.
It feels like now would be the time to do faster action and to accelerate the process.
And it seems like it doesn't seem to be budgeted.
How do I reconcile that?

Just wanted to follow up on that question.
So look at this point if we back out working capital, it looks like the business, the auto business is running at around a $1.3 billion burn in the quarter.
And if you bring your capex down to the low-6s maybe that could even converge on breakeven.
At something it looks like it corresponds with a 15 million SAAR.
But you talked about coming out of this stronger.
So I was hoping maybe you could just tell us a little bit about some of the approaches that you're taking here, are there any opportunities to accelerate restructuring maybe in light of this crisis? And what do you think you might actually look like when we actually do recover to a 15 million SAAR?

So $22 billion is a pretty huge commitment to EVs.
I was hoping you can talk about the level of volumes you're aspiring toward.
It sounds kind of like a similar commitment to another company that's targeting about one million units.
Can you talk about your Ford's cost competitiveness and the trajectory of costs for EVs? Do you agree with these expectations of cost per kilowatt hour declining to the $55 to $80 range in five years? And then lastly, in the context of what you said earlier, Jim, about allocating capital toward businesses that have strong returns.
Do you think that by 2025, you can achieve similar profitability and returns in EVs that you achieve in ICE?

I miss it.
This thing is going to sell superfast, so bravo to the team.
My question is on cell supply.
What's your latest thinking on making your own cells or JVing with someone or pure outsourcing? And I ask this, Jim, because as you can understand, many of us on this call, right, can see a situation where we have a potentially dramatic misalignment between -- basically where demand massively exceeds supply of cells, and this really could threaten the commercial targets of an OEM's EV volumes unless you get this sorted out.

3016,F,2020,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,
3017,F,2020,4,philippe-houchois,jefferies,True,0,"Yes, good evening.
Thank you very much.
I've got two questions, one for Jim and one for John.
Jim, on this alliance with our relationship with Google is interesting, and we had Renault do a similar arrangement two weeks ago in Europe.
If I stepped back a few years ago, I remember Google being seen as the enemy and the company that carmakers had to stay away from the -- avoid seeing Google getting to the car.
What has changed? Is it just simply that you looked at the cost of developing software and you feel like it's too complicate too costly and then Google is a better solution to bring that connectivity to your customers? Or has the willingness to find commercial arrangements with Google improve in terms of revenue sharing, for example, that made working with Google maybe less threatening than it might have been a few years ago? And then for John, I was just wondering, if -- you're the first OEM to give us some guidance on the impact of semiconductor shortage on earnings, and thank you for that.
I'm just trying to understand, you guide for the impact -- what the impact could be in the first half.
Let's assume things normalize from the third quarter.
How much of that negative impact in the first half would you be able to make up in the second half? Or should we think there's a net loss that we should take into account into our earnings forecast based on what you've given in terms of guidance? Thank you.

3021,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thank you, Lynn, and thanks everyone for joining us today.
Last year was like no other, with COVID dramatically and often tragically affecting all of us.
But tough times can bring out the best in people.
And boy, was that true at Ford? I'm really proud of how our people mobilized with speed and resolve to respond to this crisis.
We harnessed our capabilities and we developed a lot of new ones.
Our team members put others above themselves in both returning to work, but also to make life-saving equipment.
And I'd like to share just a few highlights of our pandemic response, including our new Finish Strong initiative to help limit the spread of the virus and save as many lives as possible until this pandemic is under control.
To-date, Ford has manufactured 55 million medical-grade masks.
And by mid-year, we will have donated 100 million masks.
In partnership with UAW, we've also produced 20 million face shields, 50,000 patient ventilators, more than 32,000 powered respirators in collaboration with 3M and 1.4 million washable isolation gowns.
More to the point of today's call, we relied on the same grit and resourcefulness to deliver a very strong year financially under difficult circumstances.
We improved our execution, while putting in place a specific and compelling plan, backed by some important early actions that are transforming Ford into a far stronger company, a company that competes and wins on behalf of our customers and other stakeholders in this exciting new landscape, which will be defined by electrification and connected customer experiences.
After safely and smoothly restarting our manufacturing production in May, following last year's shutdown, we sharply rebounded in the second half of the year as we rebuilt our inventories to meet strong pent-up demand.
In fact, we more than doubled our second half adjusted EBIT from the year before, yielding a 7.3% adjusted EBIT margin.
In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched three incredibly important vehicles that exemplify our new Ford and our direction.
Our first all-electric Mustang Mach-E, which we and more importantly others believe is the first credible mass-marketed competitor to Tesla; and the F-150, the 2021 F-150, America's favorite vehicle, it's now connected, you can sleep in it, you can work in it, it's incredibly capable and it is such a fantastic product.
And the Bronco Sport, the first member of our reimagined legendary Bronco brand, which has generated as much excitement as anything to come out of Detroit in my career.
Now, as we recap last year's results and discuss expectations for this year and beyond, I want to underscore that everything we do is in service of our plan.
Simply put, we're seeing real improvements in our core automotive business and we are laser-focused on further progress this year.
Now, this includes growing the company, generating consistently strong free cash flow for our core automotive business as well as Ford Credit.
We will allocate that capital to its best and highest uses for creating sustained value.
To achieve that, we are competing like a challenger now, earning customers and must-have products and services and rewarding customer experiences.
We're moving with urgency to deliver leading quality, reducing our costs and restructuring underperforming businesses.
We will start to grow again, but most importantly in the right areas, allocating more capital, resources and talent to take advantage of our strength in pickups, commercial vehicles and utilities, being a leader in the electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strength, but also where we have scale, expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with a suite of software services that earns loyalty and generates reoccurring revenue, and incubating, then scaling, then integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by Argo AI's world-class self-driving system.
Today, I'll touch on a few of our plan highlights, with emphasis on capital allocation, electrification and connectivity.
Back in 2017, vehicle lines had accounted for just 60% of our company's revenue, generated a 150% of our EBIT and most of the vehicles generating that EBIT earned a multiple of the cost of capital.
This imbalance was simply not sustainable and we immediately began reshaping and rebalancing our business.
We allocated capital to our strengths.
We jettisoned underperforming assets.
We created a more focused portfolio, and built the financial flexibility to unleash significant untapped value at Ford.
We've already made a tremendous progress.
Through last year, we've invested $7.1 billion in EBIT and $1.6 billion in cash in our global redesign, reshaping our portfolio, our geographic footprint and our industry footprint.
In the first phase of our redesign in Europe, for example, we prioritized profitable growth in commercial vehicles, where Ford is the number one vehicle brand in the region, but also a smaller, more targeted portfolio of passenger cars in the strongest segments, and exciting imports like Mustang and Edge that built our brand and make a solid return.
We shrunk our manufacturing footprint in Europe, we reduced regional headcount by 20%, we lowered our annual structural cost by $1.1 billion through last year.
And in the fourth quarter, Europe delivered its strongest quarterly profit in more than four years, achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%.
Let's turn to South America.
We've lost more than $4.5 billion over the last decade in South America, not acceptable.
In 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region.
We discontinued Focus and Fiesta.
And we further reduced headcount, in fact, by more than 40% through the end of last year.
And with these actions, last year we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013.
And then in early January, we went further as Ford Brazil announced it would end production and close three facilities.
That decision will de-risk our business by concentrating it on a more profitable asset-light model on our industry-leading Ranger pickup trucks, our Transit commercial vehicles and key imports.
We remain committed to serving our customers in Brazil and South America, but now with the portfolio of exciting, connected and increasingly electrified SUVs, pickups, including this amazing new Ranger, and commercial vehicles sourced from Argentina and Uruguay and other markets.
Now, we didn't take these actions lightly, and Ford is working with all of our stakeholders in Brazil to mitigate the impacts of these decisions.
At the same time, we know they were right and necessary and we are optimistic about our new business model for South America.
Now, before John walks through the last year's results and how we see 2021, I want to update you on Ford's connectivity and electrification plans.
2021 is a strategic inflection point for Ford.
We have hundreds of thousands of fully networked vehicles now in the field.
And now, we're seeing the evolving institutional capability inside Ford to leverage that data streaming off those vehicles and also use our over-the-air updates to improve quality and revolutionize the Ford customer experience.
And importantly, that means commercial vehicles too and customers.
We have more than 100,000 subscribers to our telematics and commercial vehicle software business, we call Ford commercial services, and we are just starting.
Ford's development and delivery of connected vehicles will be enhanced by a new six-year partnership with Google that we announced earlier this week.
The two companies are establishing a collaborative group that we call Team Upshift to not only unlock personal consumer experiences, but to create and make the most of data-driven opportunities in our industrial system.
The partnership will greatly enhance the Ford team's ability to innovate and deliver a consistent world-class consumer experience and as well provide Ford with a powerful technology and tools to modernize our manufacturing, our supply chain management and speed of our implementation of the data-driven business models and innovation across our whole company.
Now, as I said a few minutes ago and many times before, Ford will be a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world.
We will do this in areas where we have strength and great scale.
It's early in the transition, but the trend is clear.
We watched one out of 10 vehicles sold in Europe in December be pure electric.
EV sales in China continue to grow and the reality is the customers, including in the US, are increasingly giving E-mobility greater consideration.
We have no intention to cede ground to others in vehicle segments, where Ford is the established leader.
We are rapidly building on our electric vehicle plans and building out our manufacturing and our R&D capabilities.
We're also increasing financial flexibility, so we can accelerate and flex to keep pace with the evolving EV needs of our customers.
Now, the Mustang Mach-E, our first dedicated BEV platform, which last month was named North America Utility of the Year embodies how we lead in electric vehicles.
It's on sale now, it has stunning design, is fully connected and ready for the over-the-air updates with a tremendous technology experience.
It's delivering high-quality exceptional performance at a price in the mid-30s.
It's a fantastic vehicle, which also happens to be a full battery electric, and there are many more dedicated BEVs like this one that are coming.
As you know, Ford is a global leader in commercial vehicles and we're on the leading edge of the electric revolution there too.
We are the first company to announce plans for an all-electric van and an all-electric pickup truck.
With the E-Transit coming later this year, it has three different lengths, three different heights, we have a van, a strip chassis and a cutaway and there's more coming on E-Transit.
And then we're going to launch the BEV F-150 in the middle part of next year.
In a recent study by Cox Automotive, we -- they showed that the all-electric F-150 was the highest consideration rate and is the most appealing among major EV pickups that are coming to the market.
Our successful Ford Transit franchise is a critical pillar of our electrification plan.
We understand the needs of these customers, we're going to offer a wide variety of configurations dimension and we are developing not just the vehicles, but a whole suite of connected vehicles to serve them -- connected services.
For instance, we know from our leadership position that the average daily route driven in a transit is 74 miles, and they do not overbuy batteries.
We've validated that with over 30 million miles of telemetry data from our Ford customers.
Now with that data, we can forecast and optimize the battery life and provide over-the-air alerts, so when the vehicle needs service before anything fails for a 100% uptime, we can do that.
That van stays on the road, working, where it belongs.
Those are just two of dozens of examples of how we're employing and using data to help our commercial customers be safe and more efficient and to make more money, while at the same time creating an incredibly competitive advantage for Ford.
The value proposition for our customers extends to customizing vehicles' interiors, digital experiences, E-service networks to maximize uptime and lower their operating cost.
These are very sticky annuity-like capabilities that remove pain-points and create opportunities for our customers.
No commercial vehicle provider is better positioned than Ford to innovate and introduce services like these at scale.
We are accelerating our plans right now, breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving our costs and getting more battery electrics into our cycle plan.
We are now planned to invest at least $22 billion in electrification in the next few years through 2025.
And that's just electrification.
When you include the spending on our autonomous driving, our total commitment is at least $29 billion.
The majority of our investment in electrification supports a widening portfolio of BEVs on platforms from both Ford and alliance partners.
This electrification number does not even include the potential, of course, for vertical integration of battery production whether alone or in a JV.
As the size of our ICE manufacturing footprint decreases, the scope of our dedicated global BEV manufacturing capacity is now growing.
So far, we're busy and we have included a whole new facility in Dearborn at the Rouge to make the electric F-150, we're building the Kansas City facility for the E-Transit, Oakville, Canada for several battery electric SUVs and in China and Cuautitlan, Mexico for the Mach-E and there's a lot more to come.
Our team is busy.
Thanks for your time and attention.
And as you can hear, I'm very excited about our future.
John will now talk about our results in more detail and outlook for the year.
Over to you, John.
"
3022,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"So to be really direct about your question, probably three things really changed our mind -- or not changed our mind but got us to where we were.
First of all, it's not an exclusive relationship.
So we want CarPlay to work great in all of the vehicles.
We want Amazon Voice products to work great in our vehicles.
But the Google, three things really changed to answer your question or evolved.
The first one was, we just -- the money we were spending to keep competitive on a generic experience in the vehicle versus what they could offer in a stable, robust platform, the economics just work better.
And we could take our team and instead of doing generic capabilities, we could put them on really differentiation.
And we found that in Mach-E.
If you use the Mach-E, we call it the Menlo systems, we really started to understand that if we had a stable digital platform inside the vehicle, we could really out co-create and create better, deeper experiences for a Bronco customer or Mach-E or a commercial customer.
So basically, it was their commitment to build and to dedicate resources to a really good digital ecosystem in the vehicle.
The second one is that we really started to feel a lot more comfortable with our customers' data and how that would be protected.
And that's really important.
Ford is a very trusted brand.
All the data will be held and managed by Ford, Google won't have access to the Ford customer data in the cloud.
The third thing was their cloud.
We're trying to move our enterprise and a lot of our compute into the cloud very quickly for cost and capability.
And we think their cloud is really competitive, but so is Amazon's, those Microsoft's.
But we also saw that they were willing to make a commitment on AI and ML, I mean we are already using AI and ML throughout our company, but we need to really accelerate that.
And they have real resources, and we're willing to make the commitment.
So those are kind of the things that really swayed us.
I hope that makes sense.
But it's not necessarily exclusive.
And we really are excited about the subscription business and the digital experience that could come off of this and all the other bets we're making with the technology companies.
John?
"
3023,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,
3024,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Thanks for your question.
Just really quick on the F-150, some of the metrics -- objective metrics, we see it give us encouragement is, obviously, we're starting the year at a day supply level that we haven't seen for a long time.
That's one thing.
So a lot of opportunity to build wholesale and dealer inventory into the year.
We're starting the year with 53 days supply.
The mix of high series, which is always a big indicator of demand for the vehicle, is about 20 points higher than we normally see in the outgoing model.
So Lariat plus mix is extremely strong.
You also look at the super duty demand.
Super duty was up 14%.
It had a great improved vehicle, but I think the F-150 improvement is even bigger.
And even during the sell-down and the start-up of the new truck, that demand is -- we're turning vehicles in six days, the F-150.
If you turn to the Mach-E, really good demand so far.
We have about 70% of the customers are new to Ford.
So we have new to Ford being they haven't owned a Ford for 15 years.
The cross-shop vehicles are Porsche Boxster, Porsche 911, Mercedes E Class.
We're also seeing in the reservations as we turn them into orders.
High all-wheel drive mix more than we thought.
The extended battery is much more popular than we expected.
And don't forget, we have 127,000 federal tax credits that are each worth $7,500 each, and that is a big advantage on the pricing side.
So really strong demand, early orders for Mach-E.
On Bronco, obviously, the Bronco Sport is turning, I think, in like six days.
We sold every one we wholesale to dealers in the fourth quarter.
I think we sold over 5,000.
It's just like the F-Series turning incredibly fast, Ryan.
And I would say the Bronco, we're now just shy of 200,000 reservations, and we're now starting -- in a little bit, we'll turn those into orders.
The encouraging thing about Bronco is just the interest.
Not only do we have a lot of orders and confident in reservation, but the mix is stronger than we thought.
It's encouraging to see the two-door B3 a third but the Ford orders, very, very strong mix.
And the demand is at the dealership levels or even our reservation system are really, really strong.
And I think we could pass some Bronco Sport in January.
I think we passed 8,000 units.
So I mean -- and that's a brand-new model to our lineup.
So that gives you a picture for the demand side.
And maybe, John, any comments about the rest of performance?
"
3025,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Thank you for your question.
It's stunning how fast the industry is changing.
I watch the market really carefully in Europe and 10% in December.
Pure battery electric is amazing.
Our time is now at Ford.
We're not talking about aspirations.
We committed to California and Paris Accord and carbon neutrality a long time ago when it wasn't easy, and I'm very proud of that.
This year, as you mentioned, we're launching Mach-Es in the market now.
We think it's a real competitor to Tesla and their stronghold part of their price market.
The F-150 electric is a lot of inbound interest from our loyal customers.
We sold 780,000 F-150s last year.
We are going to find, and we are finding, within that, a duty cycle that matches electric for some of those customers.
It's such a large scale.
In transit electric, the inbounds on that vehicle are really high.
This is our turf.
And we're not just going to have one delivery vehicle.
We're going to have three lengths, two-wheel bases, three roof heights, a cut through, a cabin chassis and a van and we're not done.
So we are the leader in the Transit business.
We have the body builder connections.
100% of our transits get updated.
And we know every one of those of updaters.
So -- and we are getting more inbound for that.
So how do we manage the move? I think it's a really good question.
I don't know if any of us have the answer.
The costs are coming down quickly.
But for me and the team, the move to electric is not about batteries and motors.
It's about digital vehicle and a new customer experience.
And that is universal, whether it's F-150, ICE or a battery electric, that digital experience that we're talking about, we have 130,000 commercial solution customers now.
We have 9 million Ford Pass customers, that is universal.
So that's goodness that we'll get back in all of our business.
We just have to be very flexible, which we have those large commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities that are very flexible.
And we'll invest in both.
And we'll flex with the customers.
So I think we're ready.
This is our year.
We're going to have great offers.
And I think it's really on us.
The real proof point to me is not going to be how many we sell in the first year.
It will be how much better the vehicle is a year or two after we launch it with the same customer.
Operator
Thank you.
And our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
"
3026,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"And Rod, I think just a compliment, John, expect us to be a lot more specific in spring as we move on.
It's just -- this is not the right venue to go over specifics.
But please rest assured, we are really excited to share all the specifics of our BEV plan.
We just want to give you an idea of how we're allocating the capital.
"
3027,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Thank you so much for your question.
This is a fundamental approach that we all committed to and continue to be committed to.
We love what RJ is doing at Rivian.
It's a strategic investment.
It's not a transactional investment for this or that.
And so we'll keep you updated.
But that's a very fundamental bet and it looks like the market is liking what he's doing, too, which is good for Ford.
The partnership with Google is very fundamental.
It goes far beyond -- we want our team working on things that will differentiate us.
Google has got a great platform for navigation and content delivery, and we can co-create on top of that.
And their -- the system is great, but we're going to use Amazon Voice, and we're going to work hard with Apple on CarPlay.
And we're going to have a great relationship with Microsoft on commercial vehicles, which we will tell you about some other day.
But our partnerships in the technology area, including the Chinese partner -- technology firms, is just going to get deeper and deeper and deeper.
And as far as our relationships, our partnerships, they will change with electrification.
And you should expect more work in that regard.
Anyways, I don't think you're going to have to wait too long to hear more about that actually.
So it's a fundamental approach.
The technology partners are becoming more and more important for us to deliver that digital experience, but also to build the capability inside the company for large-scale AI/ML deployment to our industrial system, the customer experience, using that data off the vehicles for quality improvement.
And we don't have all the answers.
And these companies can really help us, and we can help them.
I hope that makes sense to you.
"
3028,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Hi, Emmanuel.
"
3029,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"So thank you for your question.
The answer is absolutely.
This accelerated spending on products and industrializing those products.
And we recognize in the guidance for explaining that, that there's more spending to come on our battery vertical integration decisions.
We just don't have anything announced today.
We have -- I'm not going to get into it, but we have two battery electric dedicated platforms.
They will include high-volume passenger cars.
But as we've always said, we're going to invest in the segments where we're the strongest.
And you can imagine what those nameplates are and what those segments are.
And we will have a great lineup of commercial battery electric vehicles.
And as well, importantly for me, is the investment in the digital experiences and the physical services to make that work.
We've learned over all these years that Ford's strength in commercial is far beyond the product.
In fact, the product is often regulated to be defined as it is.
Our strength is our distribution network.
Our ability to keep vehicles on the road.
Our upfitters, our bailment policies, and all of those strengths will come to bear as we electrify those lineup.
And we have more ambitions, as you can see with the FCS software business.
That business is growing very fast.
It's a telematics and commercial services business.
And that's a good example of the kind of investments we're making beyond the four-walls of the product.
So as we electrify, we're not just going to bring more products, we're going to get more digital and we're going to get into physical services and digital services as well.
But they'll be in the nameplates in the segments that we have a great reputation.
As John said, we have a good owner base.
Operator
And our next question is going to come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
"
3030,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"All right.
Thank you.
Appreciate the feedback on the product.
And to me, the real test for our fitness on Mach-E will be, as I said, how that product performs, its range, its capability, its quality, a year or two from now for that same customer.
"
3031,F,2020,4,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"That's the key.
I was just going to say where do you see the GT.
Look, our first inning -- if this is a nine-inning ball game, our first inning, I think we played it about right, which is to buy the best technology at the lowest price out there during what you could argue in this first inning was an excess supply batteries.
But now the game is changing.
And the next step is going to be a much more aggressive electrification plan and the subsequent impact on our battery strategy, and we cannot afford to be in the situation we are with semiconductors right now, which is a good metaphor for what you're bringing up.
So you can expect from Ford, follow-on this battery electric commitment, more news on our vertical integration plans.
And there are options.
We could do it ourselves.
We can go to a JV and as well out there, not too far away, it's a solid-state technology moving very quickly.
There's a lot of bets to be made.
This company -- this team is in the midst of making those.
And we'll let you know as soon as we can.
But we get it.
We want to lock it up.
We want to make sure it's not a constraint.
And we also want to pick the right technologies and the right partners at the time and have the flexibility as well as the technology changes, like solid state.
I don't know -- we can't give you a date right now, whether that will be the spring or tomorrow.
But please understand, we totally get the issue and the opportunity.
"
3032,F,2020,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, guys.
I just wanted to ask a question, Jim, just around the transition to EVs and maybe using F-150 as an example, to maybe talk around.
I mean, when do you think sort of the tipping point is for the consumers, where they see enough EVs on the road that your ICE vehicles become somewhat obsolete and depresses rigids.
And how do you kind of work through that transition? And specifically also around the F-150, I mean, can you position this as a performance enhancement, particularly around torque for trucks that you can actually get paid a tremendous amount of money for kind of like you did with EcoBoost, I mean you can joke on an EcoBoost, it wasn't really fuel economy that people love, it was a low end torque, right? I mean -- so I mean, just what's the tipping point where you kind of get hit a little bit on your rigids, on your outgoing ICE vehicles? How do you manage that transition? And how do you think about your position in EVs?
"
3033,F,2020,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,
3034,F,2020,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Jim.
So when you analyze our fourth-quarter results or even our second half performance last year, it's important to key in on the durable changes we've made to our underlying earnings power, including in automotive business increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flow.
Right now, our year-end liquidity of nearly $47 billion provides the financial flexibility to opportunistically invest and grow and even accelerate investments if we choose to in key areas like electrification, in connected services and in our 8% company-adjusted EBIT margin, the target that we're aiming for, we believe we can generate healthy annual free cash flow to fuel our growth.
When we initially set our 8% target, the secular forces accelerating today were still in their infancy.
EV penetration at scale was years out, connectivity and digital services were still nascent, and autonomous vehicles, well, they were still largely in labs.
So you fast forward to 2021 and the landscape is vastly different and so are the calls on our capital.
Our goal remains to hit the 8% margin and, in doing So to reallocate profit and capital from a far healthier core business to exciting growth opportunities that will unlock long-term value.
Let's take a look at the fourth-quarter performance.
In automotive, both wholesales and revenue declined by 9%, while a lower industry influenced both of these metrics, so did the planned changeover in North America to launch our all-new 2021 F-150.
Our initial estimate was for a decline of 100,000 units, and we came in right on that number.
Fourth-quarter revenue benefited from broad-based gains in net pricing and product and series mix, especially in North America and Europe.
Let's take a look at our individual regions in a bit more detail, starting with North America.
The North America business offset some of its decline in top-line metrics with continued growth and an increase in mix of commercial vehicles.
Together, volume and revenue of Transit and Super Duty vehicles were up 14% and 24%, respectively.
With the launch of the new F-150 now complete, we're building every vehicle we can.
EBIT was $1.1 billion, up 53% with a margin of 4.9%.
This growth was driven by excellent yield management and the non-reoccurrence of the UAW contract cost of fourth quarter of last year, all of which was partially offset by the lower F-150 volume I mentioned.
In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 15% and 10%, respectively, reflecting industry softness and Ford share losses as we refocused our portfolio on strengths in Ranger pickups, Transit van and key imports.
On a full-year basis, Ranger gained 1.8 points of share to 15.6%.
Revenue performance in South America was better than wholesale as we took aggressive price actions to offset inflation and currency pressures.
As Jim mentioned in 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region, discontinued the Focus and Fiesta and further reduced headcount in total by more than 40% through the end of 2020.
These actions and other actions that we've been taking contributed to the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in regional EBIT, and we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013.
With our recent announcement to exit manufacturing in Brazil, we have fundamentally de-risked this portion of our business and delivered another significant milestone in our global redesign.
Shifting to Europe.
Europe wholesales and revenues were both negatively affected by lower industry volumes.
However, Ford's revenue in the region was up modestly aided by higher net pricing and improved mix.
Our commercial business in Europe strengthened its number one position to a 14.3% share, which is a gain of 70 basis points.
Ford has the broadest network of commercial vehicle dealers in Europe, including close to 800 dedicated transit centers.
And during the quarter, the commercial, passenger and import vehicle businesses were all profitable.
And the reduced manufacturing footprint that Jim had referenced along with the $1 billion decline in structural costs over the last two years allowed Europe to deliver its strongest quarterly profit in four years, with an EBIT of $400 million and achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%.
Now, turning to China.
China delivered a 27% increase in wholesales.
Retail sales grew 30%, outpacing the overall industry sales growth of 12%.
Ford's share in China grew by 40 basis points to 2.4% with a 12 point increase in the mix of utilities to 36%.
The mix of commercial vehicles reached 45% in the quarter supported by strength in light trucks, pickups and other vehicles.
Importantly, our dealer network return on sales remains positive.
Now, while it's still a modest EBIT loss, this was China's third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit improvement aided by an enhanced mix of vehicles, including locally built Lincoln products.
The China-specific Lincoln models accounted for 76% of the brand's in-country retail sales, that's up from just 2% last year.
Wholesales and revenue results for the international market group varied, but its retail sales increase of 1.8% countered an industry decline of 3%.
IMG continues to capitalize on its strengths in Ranger pickups and Everest SUVs, and Ranger was the best-selling 4×4 pickup in Australia.
And just this week, we announced a $1 billion investment to modernize and upgrade our Ranger pickup plant in South Africa, an important low-cost export hub that supplies 100 markets, including Europe.
This paves the way to significantly expand production for the next-generation Ranger starting in 2022 and profitably grow this important business for us.
Excluding the impact of India, IMG was profitable in the quarter led by Australia and Vietnam.
In December, Ford and Mahindra jointly decided not to complete a previously announced joint venture.
This outcome was driven by the fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions caused in part by the global pandemic.
While we continue our independent operations in India, we are actively evaluating alternatives and reassessing capital allocation for India.
Turning to mobility.
We now plan to invest at least $7 billion in autonomous vehicles through 2025, including the $2 billion we spent through 2020.
Our plans include standing up our commercial AV business by 2022 to move both people and goods, and we also believe that Argo AI's self-driving system remains on a shortlist of leaders in the autonomous technology.
With improving unit economics, we continue to grow our Spin scooter network, which has become more relevant in a COVID world as people explore alternative modes of transportation.
In fact, indicative of the strength of our city relationships, Spin won the overwhelming majority of all scooter permits it applied for in the US in the municipalities last year.
Now, let's turn to Ford Credit.
Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBIT up almost $300 million to $900 million, a record fourth quarter.
Improved auction values drove the performance and we continue to experience strong credit performance with a low loss to receivables ratio.
All told, we delivered $1.7 billion in adjusted EBIT in the quarter, up $1.2 billion with an adjusted EBIT margin of 4.8%, which was up 3.6 points.
Considering how the first half of 2020 unfolded, I'm incredibly proud of how the Ford team came together to finish the year with such strength, setting a firm foundation for this year.
Let's turn to 2021.
The global semiconductor shortage situation is fluid and we're evaluating and updating the potential effects on our business in real-time.
We want to be transparent and also prudent.
Therefore, we think it's premature to size what the ultimate impact will be on our full-year results.
That said, we ended 2020 having achieved positive lasting change in the underlying trajectory of our earnings power, including the ability of our automotive business to generate consistent levels of strong free cash flow over time.
For 2021, we were on a course to earn between $8 billion and $9 billion in adjusted EBIT, including a $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian.
That scenario anticipated continued EBIT improvement in each of our regional businesses, except for South America, which we expect to be flat through their transition this year.
We anticipate mobility to be flat and Ford Credit EBT to improve.
We also expect to generate between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow.
However, the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence our operating results this year.
The situation is changing constantly, so it's premature to size what the shortage will mean for our full-year results.
However, right now, our current estimates from suppliers support a scenario, where we could lose 10% to 20% of our planned first-quarter production.
If that scenario is extended through the first half, this could adversely impact our full-year adjusted EBIT by between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of reasonable cost recoveries and some production makeup in the second half of the year.
So we should expect full-year cash and EBIT effects to be about equal with quarterly cash implications more volatile given the mechanics of the company's working capital.
So our team is working with our suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply, minimize the profit impact, while also prioritizing customer orders, new vehicle launches and compliance with our CO2 emissions regulations.
For example, similar to other actions we've already taken, we are adjusting shifts next week at our Dearborn Truck Plant and Kansas City Assembly Plant.
These actions are contemplated in the 10% to 20% scenario for the first-quarter volume that I just mentioned.
We will provide you with an update on the semiconductor issue when we report our first-quarter 2021 financial results, and that's on April 28.
So, before we open the call for Q&A, I will end where Jim began.
It cannot be overstated, 2020 was a year like no other, no other in our life times.
The Ford team responded exceptionally both personally and professionally.
We're exceedingly proud of all of our colleagues around the world.
We made tough, strategically sound decisions in 2020 that have created durable beneficial changes to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business that is increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flows.
And that financial flexibility will allow us to make the right investments for long-term profitable growth and value creation.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with J.P.
Morgan.
"
3035,F,2020,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
I'd just say, Ryan, that when you look at it, Jim went through the portfolio transformation, but the global redesign is really starting to take hold in derisking the business.
We're starting to see some strength in China.
The localization of key project -- of products there, Lincoln, for sure, improving our cost structure there by localizing.
We're leveraging capacity at the JVs to build Lincolns and commercial vehicles.
Our partnering to share investments and improve scale, you saw that with the South Africa announcement we had building the Ranger and a VW pickup now in that facility.
So I think we're starting to see strength across all the areas we've been talking about.
But we're also focusing on the basics of the business, right? We've renewed our focus on our quality improvement.
We're leveraging all of our connected vehicles to identify issues faster, improve our warranty expense, improve our ownership experiences.
We're also leaning into electrification now, as Jim said, with Mach-E being on the road, the E-Transit coming, the F-150 BEV next year.
And we're really transforming the team as well.
We're bringing in new talent.
We're organizing ourselves to grow our core businesses and expand that through connectivity and digital services.
And so when you look at all of that across the business and you start to see some of the strength take hold, it gives us confidence in the year, and it allows us to move forward with the confidence we're projecting.
So I think there's a lot of good things going on here.
Operator
And our next question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.
"
3036,F,2020,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Hi, Rod.
Well, clearly, we need to see improvements in cost structure, similar to what you've been talking about in that 55 to 80 kilowatt hour for the pack.
And that's going to happen over time, and we definitely are pushing in that direction.
And that's going to be required.
We're going to see the ICE and the BEV converge as they transition.
And yes, we do see them being profitable.
In fact, Mustang is profitable today, the Mach-E.
So it's going to transition over time.
We're deeply focused on driving that cost structure down on our BEV vehicles.
We're leaning into our strengths where we see some synergies and taking advantage of that.
So it's definitely a focus we have.
From a standpoint of the $22 billion commitment to EV, as Jim said, as we lean into our strengths, we're focused on BEV.
We're focused on expanding that growth.
We're focused on the digital experience and the customer experience with those vehicles.
And as that transition takes hold, over time, we're going after the larger segments, right? These are segments that we lead in.
There's a strong customer base.
And with that, as Jim said, there's duty cycles.
There's specific needs for these customers with these vehicles.
And we're going to continue to work with them to give them the solutions they need from a battery electric standpoint.
But at this point, we're not going to guide on a number of volume and by when at this point.
"
3037,F,2020,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
What I can say is that we are continuously putting pressure on ourselves to pull that timeline ahead as quickly as possible.
And so it is shifting.
We're focused on it.
We're focused on improving the business as quickly as we can and continuing to invest in our growth areas.
We see a stepped-up improvement in 2021.
You saw that in the guidance and outside of the chip issue.
And we're going to continue to work that.
And as we do move closer to that 8%, we achieve those targets, we're generating good healthy free cash flows that we're going to invest in the business.
So yes, we are putting tremendous pressure on the team to move that forward and achieve that as quickly as we can.
"
3038,F,2020,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Hi, Emmanuel.
"
3039,F,2020,4,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Thanks.
So the scenario we laid out is based on the discussions we've been having with the supply base over the last couple of weeks, and it's very fluid.
And we know that it's an industry impact.
And what we see is that we could lose between 10% and 20% of the planned first half production.
And so when you take that on an annual basis, the impact of that full year could be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion.
And like we do, and we did -- like we do and like we did with COVID, we've assumed in there some reasonable cost recoveries and our ability to recover some of the production in the second half.
And so the net impact on the year would be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, depending on where this falls out, relative to the production disruption in the first half.
And that's why we tried to frame it up to give a scenario around what it could be because it's very fluid right now.
And as we get through this quarter, in April, we'll be able to share more details.
We think we'll have a lot more understanding of exactly how this is going to fall out.

Good evening.
Thank you for taking the question.
Jim, I'd like to ask a question on partnership because if we think about the tenure of Jim Hackett, it seems like one of the core focus is really on building out partnerships, and I think we saw with VW, Mahindra and Zotye, Rivian.
But when we look at how things have played out in recent months, I know we've seen you terminate plans with Mahindra and Zotye.
It seems like vehicle with Rivian has sort of been deemphasized.
But on the flip side, we also see you forming this partnership with Google.
So all in, wondering how you expect to use partnership as you're setting your agenda? And specifically, I'd be curious for that view as it relates to EV? Thank you.

3046,F,2020,4,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
It looks like even after adjusting for the Rivian gain, you're guiding to 2021 profits well above consensus, presumably helped by the volume, pricing and mix benefits of a number of highly anticipated new products, including the new F-150, the Bronco, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E.
I know you have a lot of confidence in these vehicles.
But are there any objective measures that you can share with investors as to why they should also be confident in the profit contribution of these models? So I know it's early days.
But do you have any anecdotes about how quickly the vehicles are turning on dealer lots? How the pricing has been trending for the new F-150, what the earlier customer reaction has been to the Mach-E or you're doing a lot of test drives? And I realize the Bronco still has yet to even launch.
So maybe there are fewer metrics there.
But maybe you could tell us a bit more about the waitlist, for example, whether it continues to grow or how trim levels or options have been tracking relative to expectation or what the general community response has been?

Just one question.
You mentioned a couple of times the landscape is quite different now than when you first laid out that timeline for 8% EBIT margins.
And now you're significantly stepping up investment, which is objectively a good thing.
So I know you're still targeting that level.
But is the timeline shifting?

I understand you're not prepared to give specifics, But directionally speaking, I'm curious if you can give us color on what you were trying to achieve with it? I guess, how will this be spent? And what is the goal here? Are you developing a dedicated, flexible architecture for all your electric vehicles? Are you accelerating the rollout of electric vehicles? I guess, I'm just curious how this will be used? And a point of clarification on this as well.
So your slide into -- and your presentation implies that you will focus on the areas that where you lead all these pickups, your sales from commercial vehicle seem to have some sort of commercial angle to it.
Will your electrification strategy be mostly aimed at commercial customers? Or will you have also high-volume passenger vehicles?

3054,F,2020,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi everybody.
Congratulations on the performance in the quarter.
I hope it is a sign of things to come.
I had three questions for you.
No.
1, Jim, you've talked about 10% margin target for North America for some time, and now you've shown that you can get there.
Obviously, Q4, this launch phase will be a bit challenging.
But could you talk a little bit about what you're thinking about as the time line for getting to that kind of a target more sustainably? Secondly, I noticed that the warranty costs moderated a bit, at least the cost inflation moderated.
Is that a sign that things are finally peaking? And then lastly, the drumbeat of activity in electrification obviously is something everyone's hearing, and companies are laying out some pretty aggressive targets for cost reduction in volumes.
The Mach-E looks great but it's still a relatively low-volume product.
Can you just talk a little bit about what you are thinking is and how your thinking has evolved on what kind of volumes you're anticipating or how aggressively you intend to move into electrification on some of those commercial products?
"
3055,F,2020,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"Yes.
The warranty cost, is this a sign that you're starting to get your arms around that and that it's going to start -- that there's visibility on when that's going to start coming back down?
"
3056,F,2020,3,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"OK.
And just to clarify, Jim, you didn't really provide a time line on getting to sustainably -- a sustainable 10% or better margin.
You said that you've got visibility on the revenue side and you still have work to do on the cost side.
So is there line of sight for you on that? It seems like the product side and the revenue side for North America looks pretty powerful as you look out to next year.

3059,F,2020,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks everyone.
Jim, I got a few questions for you.
I think you mentioned the phrase that EVs look great financially, I think, when you're looking out, that they seem to line up well financially.
Could you elaborate on that? My understanding is that EVs present a really great opportunity to decomplexify the vehicle, even allowing for the expensive battery costs, the things that you can remove from an EV and the way you can design a lot more efficiently relative to the spider web of complexity of the internal combustion mechanism, that -- and it's a great opportunity.
Am I correct in that assumption? And I just didn't know if -- I wanted to hear if you could add some color to that hypothesis.
"
3060,F,2020,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Yes, it does.
And you seem to have for -- even before you became CEO, express a lot of enthusiasm toward the software, services, the data opportunity for the company.

And our next question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan.
"
3062,F,2020,3,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,
3063,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn, and hi, everyone.
First, let me say how humbled I am and what a privilege it is to be the CEO of Ford.
My family's been with Ford since 1916 when my grandfather started at Highland Park here in Michigan.
And in that moment, our family story really started to change for the better, and countless people all over have similar stories about Ford.
We're a family company from the leadership of Bill Ford all the way to the members on our factory floor.
I'm extremely motivated to help build a vibrant and growing Ford that will have a positive effect for generations to come, benefiting all of our stakeholders.
Now we've assembled a very talented leadership team to get this done, a combination of strong lifetime and longtime Ford people who truly know our business.
But we also have new colleagues, bringing very different experiences and know-how and talent to the company to execute our plan.
And we plan to continue to add to this bench with key capabilities in marketing, in technology and many other areas.
Over the past several months, I've spoken to many of you, and I believe the plan we now have and have developed and are now executing on aligns well with many of your expectations.
We're committed to creating a Ford that grows profitably and generates sustainable free cash flow, led by our automotive business.
And we're going to allocate capital to the best and highest usage to drive sustainable value creation.
Now that plan, which was introduced to the Ford team and many stakeholders on October 1, is very straightforward.
Among other things, No.
1, we will compete like a challenger, earning each customer with great products but as well services with rewarding ownership experiences.
Number two, we're moving with urgency to turn around our automotive operations, improve our quality, reduce our cost and accelerate the restructuring of underperforming businesses.
And third, we're going to grow again but in the right areas, allocating more capital, more resources, more talent to our very strongest businesses and vehicle franchises; incubating, scaling and integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by new technology like Argo's world-class self-driving system; and expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with great margins but now with the suite of software services that drive loyalty and generate reoccurring annuity-like revenue streams; and being a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world where we have strength and scale.
So now speaking about EVs.
To start with, we're developing all-new electric versions of the F-150 in the Transit, the two most important, highest-volume commercial vehicles in our industry.
These leading vehicles really drive the commercial vehicle business at Ford, and we're electrifying them.
We own work at Ford.
And these electric vehicles will be true work vehicles, extremely capable and with unique digital services and over-the-air capabilities to improve the productivity and uptime of our important commercial customers.
The electric Transit, by the way, will be revealed next month, and you heard about it here first, for all of our global markets.
We believe the addressable market for a fully electric commercial van and pickup, the two largest addressable profit pools in commercial, are going to be massive.
And we're going straight at this opportunity.
Together, we think the accessible price points of these vehicles, the productivity, the capability, the cost of ownership will be very compelling for some of our customers.
And frankly, Ford is not only in front of developing the electric Transit F-150.
We also have an unmatched dealer base to provide that anywhere service or great uptime for our customers.
We have a great customer base with deep know-how on their usage and expertise in the commercial vehicle business such as the largest up-bidder community there is, period.
Also in the coming weeks, we will deliver the first Mustang Mach-E to customers in the U.S.
and Europe.
The reservations have been very strong for this vehicle, and soon after, it will go on sale even in China.
Now in 30 years of being in this wonderful business, I have never been so pumped up about one of the retail vehicles.
I recently had a chance to put 1,000 miles on a Mach-E, and that Mustang and that engineering team had to pry that vehicle out of my hands.
It just elevated experience the way it drives, the connected technology in the cabin, the ingenious cloud-enabled services.
It's all in the heart of the market from a price point.
Such a large addressable market, the two-row crossover business.
And we have a real advantage, especially in the U.S.
with the EV tax credit.
Now you're going to see our strategy of electrifying our leading commercial vehicles and our iconic high-volume products expand very quickly at Ford.
It's also important to note that we're building out our electric vehicle manufacturing footprint around the world.
And we now have four plants in North America alone, including an all-new carbon-neutral factory going up at the Rouge plant as we speak a few miles from here.
We also recently finalized an agreement with the Canadian auto workers union, Unifor, that paves the way for future electric SUVs to be built by our team in Oakville, Canada.
Now as we execute our plan, my commitment to each of you is transparency, including purposeful, measurable key performance indicators, so you can objectively track our progress.
We plan to provide you with more details about our plan, including financial targets in the spring.
With that, let me briefly touch on the robust third quarter and what we have on tap for the fourth quarter.
When you look at our results, they reflect the benefit of our decision two years ago to allocate capital to our strongest franchise, namely: pickups, a whole range of utilities across the world, commercial vehicles and iconic passenger vehicles.
Additionally, we saw higher-than-expected demand for our new vehicles in the quarter.
At a time when inventories are really low following the virus-related first half factory shutdowns.
Now this contributed to a very favorable pricing environment and mix.
Together, these factors, plus the strongest performance from Ford Credit in 15 years, led to a total company adjusted EBIT margin of 9.7%.
That's 490 basis points higher than last year.
As an outcome of all this, we generated $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow.
Throughout 2020, even during the industrywide shutdown of COVID and as we prioritized the safety of our team, we've been disciplined in preparing for a high-quality fourth quarter launch: first of the 2021 F-150, you can live in it, you can work in it, you can sleep in it; the Bronco Sport, the first of many Broncos to come; and my favorite, the all-new all-electric Mustang Mach-E.
In fact, we used the unanticipated downtime to continue to validate the preparations for these important launch vehicles, and in the case of the F-150, a methodical sell-down and the changeover for our current model.
While I'm proud of our team, I'm delighted to say that we're in good shape in important areas of readiness for these launches.
Software, the hardware engineering is done.
Supplier manufacturing readiness looks great.
In fact, right now, our all-new F-150s are rolling off the line in Dearborn as we speak, and production will soon start in Kansas City.
And we're starting to build the Mustang Mach-E and the Bronco Sport actually early this week.
Before I turn it over to John, I want to thank each of you for joining us today.
Despite the strong numbers in the third quarter, we know we haven't fixed the issues that have held us back in our automotive business.
They include warranty costs, which remain unacceptably high.
I plan to be transparent and focused on both customer and shareholder value, proving out this business and our plan quarter after quarter, year after year.
And now John, let's take everyone through details.
"
3064,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Yes.
Thanks, Rod.
On North America, I think it's really important for us to be clear, turn around our automotive operations and North America needs to absolutely be at 10-plus percent.
As you can see from the pricing and the mix, I think Ford is the strongest brand in the U.S.
industry, mainstream brand on pricing and mix.
Our issue in North America is cost and growth.
On cost, it's really isolated to material cost, which is tied to that higher pricing, of course, and warranty.
Warranty in the last few years, coverage is up $1 billion to $2 billion depending on the year, and that is not OK.
So although it moderated in the quarter and we have taken a lot of actions on craftsmanship, long-term durability, we have a much bigger ambition to improve the quality of our vehicles.
We have taken a lot of countermeasures.
They will take time.
I'm happy to go into those, if you'd like.
But I would say our North America 10% is really a cost journey for us because on the growth side, we have a whole new Bronco lineup coming, a brand-new F-Series coming.
These are fantastic opportunities for us on the top line for the next many years to come.
So our journey to get to 10% is a cost.
On electrification, I want to cover that one next because it's quite important.
There's been a lot written about the electrification of our industry.
And Ford's bet is different.
We're betting on a full lineup of commercial electrified vehicles.
We're building a plant at the Rouge.
We are the No.
1 nameplate in the U.S.
industry.
We sell over one million F-Series.
We have an enormous customer base who are looking to reduce their costs.
And so I'm not going to get into forecasting the volumes, but we really see in this first inning of electrification, and it will be a long game that plays out over many years, that we have tremendous volume opportunity.
We are not going after the $100,000-plus market.
These are affordable vehicles.
They're in the key price points in the U.S., the Mach-E between $45,000 and $70,000 two-row crossovers, huge addressable market here in Western Europe.
And in commercial, we're not planning a very exclusive, small 1% of the addressable U.S.
industry.
We're talking about these vehicles being 10-plus percent of the revenue pool in North America at their price.
So they look great financially for us.
But I guess we aren't looking at electrification for the propulsion.
We think the real change here is the connectivity and to run a business based on the data.
So the upgraded electric architectures in the Mach-E and the F-150 electric, to me, is the most important because it allows us to reduce our costs inside the company and give customers a totally different experience.
And your middle question?
"
3065,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Very specific question, so thank you.
First of all, we have a great plan for Europe.
We were on track for our CO2 target this year until the Kuga PHEV situation came up with a supplier late in the year.
As I mentioned today, it's a bit new news, maybe not as dramatic as $100,000 retail offroader, but the electric Transit is a really big deal for Ford Motor Company.
We're No.
1 in the U.S.
We're No.
1 in Western Europe.
And we think electrifying this product is going to be really key, and that will be a key part of our CO2 compliance, that announcement.
So we continue to see in Europe more city restrictions.
Many, many of our small and medium-sized business owners are now asking for all-electric solution.
And we also think the quality of the product will be a benefit for our European customers as well.
The Mach-E will be sold in Europe next year in volume.
And so we have a great plan next year with the Mach-E.
And we have a number of hybrids coming out next year in Europe in mild hybrids.
I can't be specific.
But we really have a great lineup in Europe, over 20 models.
But what gets the leadership team really excited about Europe is the commercial vehicle business and the electrification of our high-volume van.
"
3066,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"I think the flexibility between battery electrics, plug ins is not very high.
So we're really locked in as we should be.
So I wouldn't -- this is not like vehicle mix or something like that.
All the battery supplies are slightly different.
And also the lead time for changing battery capacity is a lot longer than most other major components in the vehicle.
So I would think about those capacities in terms of flexibility very different than I would a traditional ICE powertrain.
"
3067,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"We're not going to do that today.
"
3068,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"Well, first of all, for Ford, our plan is very simple, turn around automotive operations, modernize the company and, in a way, disrupt ourselves, launch high-growth businesses like our CV services business or a go-to-market customer-facing AV business.
And so our calls on capital are much more complicated than just EV and vehicles.
We have 15,000 software engineers at Ford right now and that will grow.
So our calls on capital are software, the credit company, obviously.
But increasingly, it's these services businesses.
And we need talent.
We need cash and capital to support them.
It's all funded essentially by our core automotive operations.
And so the turnaround of automotive operations is not just a share -- a stakeholder journey.
It's actually the lifeblood of our future because it funds everything.
And so how we look at it is getting our automotive operations overseas to profit and then a solid sustainable return, dealing with the issues of passenger cars in Europe and South America and India, the three problem kind of areas we've had in automotive, and getting our North America operations 10-plus percent is an absolute minimum for the company to fund not just the electrification journey but as well our move to services, data and software.
"
3069,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"These are great questions.
If you don't mind, I think it's best if we take a pass and we talk about this next spring.
It is such a fundamental question you're asking.
It is such an important question for Ford.
I don't think the third quarter earnings is the right venue.
We need to take our time and go through this with you and all of the key stakeholders at Ford.
And I think you'll be -- I think you'll find it for all of us to be a lot wiser if we just take more time and we have specifics for you.
"
3070,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Well, thank you for your question.
It's a very important one for us.
After several years of making really tough choices, we now have the opportunity in North America to grow.
And I'll emphasize again something I put in my speech, and I think it's quite important for everyone to understand our ambition.
As John mentioned, our share of F-Series grew.
Our mix of SUV grew.
Our car share is declining almost below 10% now.
And our North America share increased one full point in the quarter.
And we have Bronco we've never had before.
We have Mach-E that we've never had before.
And we're really excited about the profit potential for all those vehicles.
So here we are on the eve of Ford Motor Company being able to execute well and grow in North America.
When you look outside of North America, the growth that matters for us is commercial vehicles in Europe, a key growth metric for us.
In China, we have an opportunity to grow.
Again, we just localized the Explorer and the whole Lincoln lineup.
We haven't sold as many Lincolns as we did in September in 25 years and it's because of China.
So we have a huge opportunity to grow in China.
And we have an opportunity to grow with export models coming from Mahindra.
And I have to say, we haven't talked a lot about this but I'll leak it out.
And that is we have some really exciting, affordable products for North America.
They're going to help us grow profitably.
So I think what you'll see is China and North America growth opportunities, and the rest of the world, we're really focused on where we can win with Ranger or the commercial vehicles in Europe.
And you'll see us continue to grow these services businesses along the way.
I hope if there's one message you would get from Ford, from this leadership team is that we're really trying to think, asking everyone to think about growth at Ford is more than unit volume growth.
We want to grow our software business, our services business.
I hope that made sense.
"
3071,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,
3072,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"We have more work to do, that's all I'll say.
We are not satisfied with the quality run rate.
It may be coming down but that's not what we're targeting.
We're targeting a fully competitive level of warranty spend on coverages, and that's got lots of zeros next to it.
To do that, Rod, there's a couple of things the team has decided to double down on.
For suppliers who ship us bad parts, we're going to have punitive financial.
I mean if they're bad shippers for multiple times.
We put more resources in our plants for supplier quality.
We have a lot more resources dedicated and a ton of transparency on quality issues that are open for more than 30 days in the company.
It's a key metric that we drive our management team to.
So those are the kind of changes we made.
And I wouldn't say this quarter is anything that we're proud of.
"
3073,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Yes.
"
3074,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"So thanks for your question.
On the material cost side, it's kind of everywhere.
A good example would be we have a proximity key in your pocket to unlock the door in all four doors of the F-150.
When we look at the vehicle usage data, we found that people use the proximity sensor for the front two doors.
We do not need a proximity sensor in the rear two doors.
Our jack on the F-150 looks like it will last about 50 years.
That's not the case for our competitors.
So it's everything from the way we package our features, the actual bill of material, and the team has been working through all these opportunities since February.
We made progress but we need to make a lot more progress, especially with the more expensive launch vehicles.
And I think the real enabler is going to be complexity reduction.
We've been talking about complexity reduction for -- as a company for quite some time as a key fitness for the leadership team, but we have a lot more work to do on complexity reduction.
And that will be a huge enabler for not only our manufacturing operations but also our material cost.
"
3075,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"Sure.
Thank you.
I guess the three key messages for our electrification strategy of the company is we're going after very large addressable markets and profit pools and we're playing to our strengths.
I'll come back to your question.
The second is to turn battery electrics into a digital kind of service model, not just a propulsion system, and that we're in the first inning.
And the second inning is going to be quite important for the company to transition as well.
Related to the cost, initially, several years ago when we made these investments and decisions, the cost of the battery, the profitability of the vehicles is really challenging.
What we found since then, once we started to look at the real cost of CO2 of our internal combustion engine, when we started to look at -- in commercial terms, offering bidirectional charging, bringing charging to the job site and electricity job site, we started to realize that there's a lot more revenue opportunity, a lot lower cost than marketing because of the connected services.
And of course, the cost, the way Hau and the team looked at the cost of our battery, we used kind of a temporary overcapacity situation to get very competitive cost and also cherry-picked the best chemistry out there.
All that kind of came together with much more compelling financial picture for these first cycle products.
I think that's what I was referring to when you look at the all-in comparison to ICE, also the revenue opportunity.
We had never really -- when we got into the commercial world of electrification, I think we -- our eyes were very open and very informed by the aluminum investment in F-150, that people are willing to pay, in the case of lightweighting, more than just the lightweighting, fuel economy.
It's a commercial vehicle for towing and payload.
When you think about bringing energy to the job site or bidirectional charging for small, medium-sized business, it's kind of a game-changer for them in terms of -- and for us for revenue.
I hope that makes sense.
"
3076,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,"Yes.
Great question.
So first of all, it starts with the talent.
We attracted Alex Purdy from Deere, who went through the whole Deere journey, moving to software and data.
We attracted Gil, who's now our data analytics lead.
We now have -- we've had the talent on board for enough time.
We really understand the opportunity.
I think the opportunity first came, Adam, with internal, the company.
You can imagine with our warranty -- the data codes off the vehicle instantaneously having AI models, analyzing all those data codes, how exciting that is to our frontline engineers, how exciting it is to have that data be available to all of our engineers on actually the bill of material and its usefulness for a company that has very expensive bill of material.
But then it became very quick for us, especially when we got outside of Dearborn and listened to the opportunity on services that over-the-air updates that are really relevant to the customer.
In the case of commercial, they run their businesses off these vehicles.
So dynamic routing, telematics, driver coaching to drive more economically.
The people that have our small fleets, they just love this because they haven't had that data before.
And we can see a day, not too distant future, with a full lineup of pure battery electric commercials, where we have a whole service business.
And that service business is charging.
It's small -- enterprise solutions for small, medium-sized businesses.
It's repair -- a more affordable repair and upgrade of the physical vehicle.
And that's what we're busy doing.
That's our double transformation.
One is to transform our automotive operations.
The other one is, in a way, to kind of disrupt ourselves.
"
3077,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"And as far as the launch, to complement John, we are so excited about this new F-150, all-new powertrains, best towing, best payload.
It's the best F-150 we've ever had.
And wait until you see the inside.
It's incredible, the technology.
And customers are asking us for that.
Look, we've completed the design phase, the engineering phase.
Hau and the team did a great job.
And we then finished the supplier readiness and manufacturing readiness.
My whole leadership team and myself went to both plants personally to review the launches a couple of times.
And we're now in high production, starting the ramp-up curve at Dearborn and Kansas City.
We expect to start soon.
I think we don't know until we start getting up that ramp curve what we're going to see.
But I'd say one of the things I would complement the Ford team, Hau, Linda Cash, the whole team, was the way we used COVID.
During the COVID shutdown, we didn't stop with the quality assessment of the launch.
And there was a lot of work done on the software especially.
This is an all-new electrical architecture for us.
There's a ton of new software.
And we used that downtime to really prove out our capability.
And so we're a long way from declaring victory.
It's a daily huge global team working on the F-150 launch.
But we've worked through the launch so far.
We've made a lot of progress as a team and now we're into mass production.
So stay tuned.
"
3078,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Thanks.
I think the simple way to look at it is we're kind of in the first inning of this transition of the industry to a battery electric future, and we're deep into the planning for the second cycle of those products.
Competitive reasons, we're not going to share the cycle plan with you, but you can imagine that we're getting more and more excited about an electric future.
Now we have some great ICE products.
And we think that, that market will still be robust.
But we're making our bets on iconic retail vehicles.
And electric is definitely something that we're more and more excited about and our capital is following.
We don't want to just be one of the many OEMs to transition to electric.
We want to lead the electric change.
That's why we've committed to Paris.
That's why we're standing with California.
And that's in our capital.
And we feel that the way we're doing it at Ford is the most important message, which is commercial and work.
Those customers run their business on these vehicles.
They're more attentive to cost of ownership.
The vehicles have higher utilization, and therefore, the lower cost of ownership of operation is more important to them.
And they're especially interested in the data.
And so I think although we could talk about general investment levels, the key message for Ford is more of the segments that we're investing in and that this is not a propulsion story.
This is an investment in the digitization of our business.
"
3079,F,2020,3,jim-farley,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"And the battery that is used in the Kuga PHEV is not [inaudible] so it's a supply [inaudible].
"
3080,F,2020,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening guys.
Thanks for all the info and congrats, Jim, for leading the call here.
Interesting stuff, early days.
Just a first question.
As you look at the strength in the third quarter, obviously, there was great execution and some strategy around volume, mix and price that was helped by good industry dynamics.
I'm just curious if you think about those three key factors once we get through the changeover of the F-150 in the fourth quarter and might bleed into the first quarter of next year.
How much of that do you think will reverse? And as you look at what you're producing at the moment and your focused shift in mix to a richer mix, how much of these beneficial factors can be maintained going into 2021 or maybe just even on a run rate basis getting into '21 specifically?
"
3081,F,2020,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"Maybe a follow up on that.
I mean how much of this you think is somewhat transitory for market factors? Because you could argue right now that the industry volume is pretty -- it's relatively strong relative to peers but is not really, in absolute terms, quite that amazing.
So it seems like there's an underlying demand for stronger mix than we all may have thought six, 12, 18, 24 months ago.
So I mean as you're going after this mix with this improved product, I mean, is there something that you're kind of seeing in the market, maybe just specifically even in the third quarter? Because I mean this is really heady stuff that you're running into and it's a real positive.
"
3082,F,2020,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"OK.
And then maybe just one last question.
On lease deferrals, I mean, how many leases did you defer in the second quarter that came back in the third quarter or might come back in the coming quarters? And sort of in addition to that, when you see auction volumes or auction values, I should say, being very strong, how long do you expect that to continue? Because it just seems like there's a lot of positive news on these lease deferrals as well as what's going on in the used vehicle market that's helping out not just Ford Motor Credit but the core new vehicle business as well.
"
3083,F,2020,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,"OK.
So as far as what you're selling in the auctions right now, it's normal run rate of lease returns flowing directly into auctions and no edge or flows or flows or tugs or pulls by you?
"
3084,F,2020,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,4,"Thank you very much.

3086,F,2020,3,joe-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Thanks for squeezing me here at the end.
Maybe just two quick ones since we touched on a lot.
I realize you are not talking about free cash flow for the fourth quarter.
But the Ford Credit EBT year-to-date is $1.7 billion.
The distribution is only $1.1 billion.
And I think you've committed in the past to dividending all that out.
So should we expect a catch-up in the fourth quarter?
"
3087,F,2020,3,joe-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"OK.
And then just lastly, John.
I saw in the media, I think you made a comment about how it's too early to talk about the dividend reinstatement.
I realize ultimately, it's a Board decision.
But I'll open this up, I guess, to Jim and John.
In each of your opinion, should Ford be paying a dividend over the coming years given the transformation you're talking about? And if so, what are really the parameters you're looking for, for reinstating that dividend?

3090,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Jim.
First, let me say what an honor it is to be the CFO of this great company.
And I really can't remember a time when we've had this much opportunity to transform and grow our business.
And so it's incredibly exciting, and delivering on that potential, it's an important responsibility all of us have to our customers and to our stakeholders.
Now to be clear, our transformation and growth plan is predicated on delivering an 8% or better adjusted company EBIT margin and consistently generating free cash flow so we can invest in accretive, high-return products and services.
And so my initial priorities to help drive this are: one, help our team fix or dispose of underperforming parts of our business so we can allocate capital to its best and highest use; and two, further strengthen our balance sheet.
We will make the tough decisions to improve our financial flexibility and ensure that we have the resources to build and grow our business.
Now let me summarize the third quarter.
As Jim mentioned, we had a strong quarter, delivering a 9.7% company adjusted EBIT margin.
Now that margin was driven largely by higher-than-expected vehicle demand, positive net pricing and favorable mix as inventories were limited because of the virus-related shutdowns in the first half of the year.
North America and China benefited from growth in both wholesales and revenue, while Europe, South America and our Internationals Market Group were still affected by COVID-related industry declines.
In addition, our performance continues to benefit from our portfolio refresh as we reallocate capital to our franchise strengths.
Ford Credit also contributed, turning in its strongest performance since 2005, generating $1.1 billion in earnings before taxes with help from strong auction values.
Now before I talk about the rest of our business, let me put our record $6.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow in perspective.
Not only does it reflect the strength of our EBIT in the quarter, but as we indicated last quarter, working capital recovered sharply as we rebuild production to full capacity after a shutdown, largely driven by supplier payables.
In the third quarter, the payable build was completed and this was worth about $4 billion.
The strong cash flow in the quarter gave us the confidence and the ability to make a second payment on our corporate revolver, which we did on September 24.
So now we have fully repaid the entire $15 billion facility, and we ended the third quarter with a strong balance sheet, including nearly $30 billion in cash and more than $45 billion of liquidity, which provides us with the vital financial flexibility we need.
Looking at North America.
Despite the difficult backdrop of COVID, the Ford team executed well operationally.
We optimized incentives for lower dealer stock levels.
We maximized production and skillfully managed supply chains to meet stronger-than-expected customer demand.
The region delivered an EBIT margin of 12.5% as it benefited from top line growth of 8%.
EBIT improved by $1.2 billion, supported by $900 million in net pricing and $400 million in favorable volume and mix.
The improvement in volume and mix reflects the effectiveness of our team in focusing on Ford's franchise strengths.
A few examples include F-Series.
F-Series gained 1.7 points to a share of more than 35% in the U.S.
Our mix of trucks and vans increased one point to 57%.
Our utility mix increased three points to 35%, with a very strong showing from Explorer.
And the mix of cars declined four points to just under 8%.
So in total, North America share increased one point to 13.6%.
In Europe, EBIT declined $300 million in the quarter, but that was driven by lower volume and about $400 million in costs related to a Kuga PHEV battery supplier issue.
Those expenses included pooling costs that are required to comply with the EU's new CO2 emission standard this year.
Now we said earlier that we anticipated meeting those new standards based on our product road map, and the Kuga PHEV was a big part of that expectation.
So we're working closely with our supplier to remediate the situation and minimize any inconveniences to our customers.
We plan to notify our customers in the coming days on how and when we will repair their vehicles.
And had it not been for the Kuga issue, Europe would have been profitable for the third quarter.
Now since Europe began its sweeping redesign of the regional business in 2018, the European team successfully rationalized the manufacturing footprint, shifted resources to our leading position in commercial vehicles and dramatically lowered structural cost.
This year, the Europe team is on track to deliver $1 billion of annual structural cost reductions.
Now relative to mix, our commercial vehicle mix share increased by 50 basis points to 15.1% for the quarter, and SUVs accounted for more than 30% of our vehicle mix in Europe, nearly nine points higher than a year ago.
Turning to China.
Wholesale shipments in China were up 22%, and that's the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.
That reflects strong sales of SUVs and commercial vehicles.
Our mix of SUVs increased 13 percentage points to 36%, and that was driven by locally built Ford Explorer, Escape and Lincoln Aviator and Corsair, with Lincoln delivering its best-ever quarterly sales in China.
And as planned, over 65% of Lincoln vehicles are now produced locally, following the introduction of the Corsair and the Aviator in the first half of 2020.
Commercial vehicle sale mix increased five percentage points to 45%, and that reflects strong JMC sales, up 38% versus prior year.
And that reflects the continued strong demand for light trucks, vans and pickups.
So overall, the team delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains and marked the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBIT, the best performance in three years.
In South America, we continued to focus on derisking the business.
The team there delivered its fourth quarter in a row of year-over-year EBIT improvement, with aggressive pricing and structural cost reductions mitigating the ongoing pressure from inflation, currency and the industry structural challenges.
And in IMG, IMG delivered a profit despite COVID-related industry declines in wholesales, which adversely affected their revenue.
F-Series gained share, and our share with the Ranger pickup in Australia increased six points to 27%.
Profitability in IMG also benefited from the work the team has done to lower structural costs.
And finally, Ford Mobility, which is building fourth generation autonomous test vehicles with the latest self-driving technology, generated its first AV-related revenue from a fleet operations pilot in Austin, Texas.
And at the same time, we are strategically expanding our Spin scooter business in the U.S., the U.K.
and Germany and generating strong revenue growth.
Now before taking your questions, I'll make a few comments about the fourth quarter, which assumes no meaningful change to the current economic environment, continued steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or disruptions since the third quarter.
Our guidance for adjusted company EBIT for the fourth quarter is between a loss of $500 million and breakeven.
Now we recognize this is a big change both sequentially and year over year, so I want to step through the key sequential drivers.
First, we expect a reduction in wholesales of about 100,000 units associated with the F-150 changeover.
Now this volume effect is a result of our measured production ramp-up plan to ensure that every vehicle we wholesale is gate released with the highest possible quality for our customers.
Now to put this in context, the approximate 100,000-unit impact in the fourth quarter will far outweigh the effect of our UAW ratification bonus in Q4 of last year, which was worth about $600 million.
Second, we also expect higher structural and other costs from the manufacturing launch activities for the Mustang Mach-E and the Bronco Sport as well as advertising launch activities for the new products, including the all-new Bronco brand and higher material and other costs.
And we expect EBT from Ford Credit to be lower sequentially, driven by strong but lower auction values and lower disposals at auction.
With this fourth quarter guidance, we now expect full-year adjusted company EBIT to be profitable for the year.
Other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged with the exception of capital expenditures.
We now expect a lower level for this year, down between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion versus $7.6 billion in 2019, and that reflects continued efficiencies.
Before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with my key takeaways from the quarter.
We had better execution, choosing where to play and our restructuring is paying off.
These things intersected very nicely with the stronger-than-expected demand.
We know there's more to fix and we're carrying on a clear plan to do that, as Jim mentioned.
And our balance sheet is solid, with nearly $30 billion of cash and over $45 billion of liquidity.
Now operator, let's open the line for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you.
[Operator instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America.
"
3091,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Hi John, thanks.
So when you look at that and we look at the business this year, really getting to the core of the run rate is a bit difficult, as you can expect, given going down in the first half and then coming back up and then the launches we have for the quarter.
And so from a cost standpoint, we are going to continue to focus, as we said, on making sure that we can really lean into what we need to do to improve the business, improve the underperforming parts of the business.
And then when it comes to the mix and the top line, we saw some strength there.
We had some wind at our back due to the strong demand with the short supply.
So seeing that going forward, we've been seeing our mix improve into our strengths of trucks, SUVs, in our iconic nameplates, and we continue to expect to push that.
But as far as a run rate and what we see into 2021, we're not ready to talk about that at this point.
And we'll come back and we'll have more to say on that early 2021.
We'll give you a read on the business then.
"
3092,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,2,
3093,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yes, it is a positive.
You see strength there.
The question is there was an imbalance in supply and demand, and that gave us some of the tailwind.
But we also are seeing, over time, as we've, over the last two years, made the concerted effort to shift into our strength of commercial vehicles and trucks.
And you see that in Europe, you see that here and you see that around the world.
So we do see strength there.
As far as how far that extends and what that looks like, we're not ready to comment on that now but we do see strength there.
"
3094,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yes.
Emmanuel, thank you.
When you look at that, when you look at the cost performance for the quarter, you really look at what we talked about with Europe is all the restructuring they've done, the headcount that they've taken out, they're now approaching and they will approach this year that $1 billion of structural cost reductions.
And so we saw that flow through, that's coming through and that's going to continue to come through.
What the team has done in South America in restructuring the business down there, getting out of low profitable vehicles, selling the São Bernardo plant and all the actions they've taken on their structure and headcount, that's going to continue to flow through.
And then we saw good performance out of International Markets Group this quarter.
They were profitable, and most of that was driven on the back of structural cost reductions.
As far as what we saw here in North America, I think with the strength that we had in demand, the short supply, we saw some good news come through in areas that you'd expect like advertising, etc.
So we have to see how demand and supply balance out and what happens there.
And as Jim said, we have a lot of work to do on our cost structure here in North America.
And that's going to be one of our key focuses.
"
3095,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Standpoint -- in the quarter, we got payables back to what we would say is a normal run rate.
And so from a standpoint of the guidance on the cash flow for the quarter, for the fourth quarter, it's going to -- like we had said with EBIT, it's going to be driven by EBIT.
So we haven't given a specific number on that.
And at this point, I'm not sure we're going to do that today.
"
3096,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Coming in, I'll answer the last question first on the product launch.
We've spent a lot of time on these launches as they're very important, as you understand, and making sure we have all the design and engineering ready to go.
We've made all the checkpoints.
The suppliers are ready, manufacturing is ready, and we started that production.
We haven't discussed what we expect from a pricing standpoint or what we expect from a margin standpoint on a new truck, and I don't think we want to talk about that today.
But what we did talk about is the fact that we are taking a very pragmatic ramp-up plan to make sure that we deliver these with quality.
And that's leading us to have wholesales, on a sequential basis, down about 100,000 units, and that's what's impacting the fourth quarter.
But getting any deeper than that, I'm not sure we're going to get into that today as far as the pricing and the cost impact of the vehicle.
"
3097,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yes.
So let's just unpack that a little bit.
If you look at Europe, we've had a strong shift into our SUVs, as we talked about earlier.
And with that has come pricing power relative to the other vehicle lines, and we expect that to continue in Europe.
Down in South America, the team is being aggressive.
And you're seeing product shift there that's driving some of the net pricing as well, the strength in pricing because we're getting out of low-profit lower-end vehicles, and we're being very focused on driving toward higher-margin products like Ranger and some of the other strengths that we have in the region.
So we're going to see that continue through.
And then we're -- in Europe, they're managing through revenue management and looking at everything.
We're doing the same thing here in North America.
It's a focus we have, but a lot of it's being driven by our strong mix.
We are seeing some pricing for product as new products coming out, and that's flowing through as well.
So we're very focused on driving the top line as best we can but equally and more focused on the cost, as Jim's talked about and as we've talked about.
That's one of our main focuses, keep moving forward on the top line and really hone in and focus in on getting the cost right.
"
3098,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"So from a cost standpoint, I'll start with that.
As I said earlier, it's about $400 million for the quarter.
We do expect some costs in the fourth quarter somewhere between $100 million to $200 million.
So that's the impact we see as it is today.
And that includes the impact of the pooling effort that we're going to have to undertake for passenger vehicles in Europe.
"
3099,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yes, I'm not sure that I'm quite clear on that.
The catch up is I think that we've been distributing from Ford Credit on a regular basis throughout the year, so I wouldn't expect there to be anything out of the ordinary there.
Marion?
"
3100,F,2020,3,john-lawler,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"Yes.
That's for the question.
I don't think this is the time to have that discussion.
I think we need to have that framed up in our total capital strategy and calls on capital and where we're headed as a business, and I think next spring would be the time to do that.
"
3101,F,2020,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,0,"Hey, good evening.
Thank you Jim, wanted to start out with a strategic question on how you plan to balance the near-term industrial recovery of the business alongside the longer-term transition to EVs.
Help me understand how you view the interplay of those two.
Is pace of EV development set regardless of the pace of your near-term recovery? Or should we look at pace of EV development driven by the extensive near-term recovery? So if you outperform on your near-term targets, you can accelerate on EV and vice versa, if the recovery is slower.
So what's the interplay of sort of near-term recovery with the pace of your EV development?
"
3102,F,2020,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"Understood.
So help me understand though.
As far as you have these larger capital calls, and presumably, you have probably a priority list and then also a nice-to-have list in terms of your investments.
Does the pace of recovery at all impact the way that you accelerate or decelerate spend on those?
"
3103,F,2020,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,2,"Got it.
And then just a follow-up on the concept of growth.
You're focused on top line growth.
I think it's also clear, at the same time, you're likely willing to further stack price, some of what maybe we can call lower quality or more to commoditize pass car volumes.
So question is, are we already seeing some structural volume decline in North America related to your exit from pass car in Europe as well.
But could you give us a sense of maybe how much more we might expect to see volume decline in the coming years related to a more commoditized product? Or maybe said differently, in which regions do you think there is more room to go on removing more commoditized, less value-add type volume?
"
3104,F,2020,3,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,3,"That's helpful color.
Thank you.

Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question.
Jim and John, you spoke to having urgency at achieving your goals in electrification that includes an electric F-150 and Transit as a few of the several electrified models that Ford is planning to bring to market over the next few years.
Hoping to better understand if the company plans to go beyond its $11.5 billion investment target in electrification that was previously articulated.
And does Ford plan to increase, in particular, the number of BEV models compared to its prior expectation?
"
3107,F,2020,3,mark-delaney,goldman-sachs,True,1,"That's very helpful.
And the company commented that because of the Kuga recall, the company will now have CO2 compliance cost this year.
Are you anticipating a similar level of cost in the fourth quarter as was realized in 3Q? And then perhaps more importantly, can you discuss if you think this issue will be resolved and if there's risk to any of your other hybrid or BEV products?

Presenting today are Jim Farley, our president and CEO; John Lawler, our chief financial officer; and also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.
Jim will have some opening comments.
John will talk about our third-quarter results and then we'll turn to Q&A.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S.
GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations, and actual results may differ from those stated.
The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 23.
Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year.
Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted.
A quick update on our IR events over the next few weeks.
On Monday, November 2, Credit Suisse will host a fireside chat with John Lawler, Marion Harris and Kumar Galhotra, Ford's president of the Americas and our International Markets Group.
And then on November 10, Stuart Taylor, executive director of Enterprise Connectivity, will participate in Deutsche Bank's Auto Tech Virtual Conference.

3112,F,2020,3,marion-harris,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Hey John, this is Marion Harris.
We did a bunch of payment extensions for loans and leases.
But if you're referring to lease deferrals for lease in where a unit comes back to auction, we didn't really do many of those.
And we had a pretty big inventory of used vehicles going into the third quarter.
And as we sold those units into an improving market, that's really what was the real benefit for Ford Credit.
If you were talking about payment extensions though, we extended about 11% of our retail loan and lease portfolio.
And of that, about 99% of those have already made a payment.
And we're back to pre-pandemic levels of extensions.
"
3113,F,2020,3,marion-harris,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Yes, that's correct.

3116,F,2020,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,0,"Thank you and congratulations to the new Ford team.
I want to drill down on the European CO2 compliance strategy, both on the light vehicle side and the LCV side.
So first on the LCV side, which, of course, as you flagged earlier, to your different standards, is that on track? And when can we expect an MEB-derived LCV platform for Europe?
"
3117,F,2020,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,1,"Right.
I would concur on that.
So moving over to the light vehicle passenger car and CV market, it struck -- there certainly is a split of opinion with many viewing plug-in hybrids as a transition and million-plus unit global EV platforms as the way to go.
A, what's your thinking on that strategy? And B, as we kind of go into '21, '22, can you flex between BEVs and plug-in hybrids or even move to a more consolidated BEV platform for Europe?
"
3118,F,2020,3,brian-johnson,barclays,True,2,"OK.
And finally, have you disclosed or can you disclose who the polling agreement is with? Maybe it will become a public record at some point in the EU.

3121,F,2020,3,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Thanks for taking my question, which relates to the upcoming F-150 launch.
Can you remind us of the timing and the impact you expect, both in terms of the profit or margin headwind from the lower production during the changeover as well as the benefit to sales mix or pricing subsequent to the roll out of the new version? And how should investors think about execution risk during the launch? Can you talk about your confidence level there and that will go according to plan and what steps that maybe you're taking to mitigate the risks?
"
3122,F,2020,3,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,"OK.
That's great.
And then lastly, wanted to ask about the strong net pricing that you've been enjoying in Europe and South America.
Can you talk about how you think your net pricing is tracking relative to the industry in those regions? And is the pricing strength more a function of the success of your company-specific product launches? Or are there other more macro factors at play, for example, as automakers work to offset lower FX in South America, etc.? Where are you in terms of your product life cycles in these regions? And how should we expect pricing to track going forward?

Good evening Jim and John, first, congratulations on your new roles.
And Jim, certainly very encouraged by your commitment to transparency and measurable improvements.
So I guess in that spirit, when we look, I guess, at your performance in the quarter, the size for the stronger demand, pricing mix, which you commented on, are you able to point us to measurable areas of underlying cost improvement that you've seen, whether it is on these material freight? We spoke a little bit -- you spoke a little bit about warranty on the structural side.
Anything that's already bearing some fruits that you're excited about? Or should we think about it more as an opportunity for the future?
"
3126,F,2020,3,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,1,"So I guess you gave a little bit of color on the -- what needs to be done on the warranty side and the quality side.
What is being done or can be done? I don't need the quantification but just in terms of what is it required to get the material and freight piece of it down.
Looks like this is probably one of the two largest buckets on the cost side here.
"
3127,F,2020,3,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank,True,2,"And then finally, there was no specific guidance on free cash flow for the fourth quarter.
I think at the last earnings call, the idea was that third quarter free cash flow would be better than the EBIT but fourth quarter worse than fourth quarter EBIT.
Any sort of sense you can give us on how to think about this quarter's free cash flow and whether there will be some sort of timing or working capital payback from the strength that we've seen in the third quarter?

3130,F,2020,2,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
I was hoping just to revisit that question about costs.
That $1 billion of Europe savings is obviously a big number.
But when I look at Slide 11, on the bridge in Europe and I look at costs, I see zero.
And I'm assuming that that's because your variable costs, mostly regulatory, is offsetting your structural cost savings.
So just taking a higher level look, the question about the $1.8 billion of structural costs and people are wondering whether there's some significant proportion of that that could be permanent or some of it may be shifting from the first half to second half or coming back.
Is there a risk here that the structural costs kind of go away but the variable cost inflation that we see, like material, freight, warranty, that kind of stays?
"
3131,F,2020,2,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"OK.
And just a question on the launches that you're talking about.
You talked about the disruption, but obviously, there's some pretty big benefits potentially next year.
I was hoping you might just talk specifically about F-150 and what it would take to put that into the positive bucket.
Do you need a significant amount of pricing to offset higher variable costs there? And on the Bronco, is it conceivable that you could produce 150,000 units a year there or is that just beyond the capability or the scope of what's possible?

3134,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn, and hello to everyone.
In a moment, I will share with you how absolutely proud I am of the way our team has performed during the COVID pandemic which, of course, has challenged every aspect of our business.
But before I do, I don't want this moment to pass without giving some important perspective on where Ford Motor Company stands relative to racial justice.
I've been heartened, frankly, to see our industry, like other industries, step up in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd.
And of course, hand-in-hand with others, there's a deep outpouring of collective grief and frustration that moved us all very deeply.
It was much more than a moment in time that will fade, but rather, we must make it a turning point for our society.
Ford is committed to leading from the front with action to enable social mobility and economic success in the African-American community, including programs in which the company has invested for more than a century.
The Ford Motor Company Fund, in particular, invests in a broad range of initiatives addressing social justice, racism, inequality and economic opportunity, and we're looking forward to more opportunities to effect positive change.
In the past week since Mr.
Floyd's death, I have met nightly with a small team of people to think as deeply as possible about what has not worked in the past that we need to address in the future.
We've begun to map the experience of black lives at Ford and see areas where improvements and enhancement would go a long way to address many of the concerns that have been voiced.
Ford is committed to leading from the front and taking action, and the results will prove themselves over time.
This is deeply a part of our culture and history.
And the Ford Motor Company Fund, in particular, has invested over many decades at the ground level to address issues of social justice, racism, inequality and economic opportunity, and we look forward to sharing much more of this in the future.
OK.
So let me turn to the quarter, which I would summarize in two ways: first, strong execution in this challenging environment; and second, meaningful progress on our plan to create a vibrant Ford Motor Company with exciting products that people want and well-positioned to capitalize on the new technology and trends that are transforming our industry.
I couldn't be prouder, as I said, of the optimism and the effectiveness our team demonstrated managing through and beyond the COVID crisis.
From the start, I think Ford has distinguished itself on three principles: protecting our team and doing our part to limit the spread of the virus, safeguarding the health of our business and stepping up to build and supply much needed personal protective and healthcare equipment.
On all three counts, the team performed exceptionally well under difficult circumstances.
The strong execution enabled us to deliver much better financial results than we expected just three months ago.
For example, our team did a fantastic job safely restarting production and wholesale exceeded targets.
Frankly, our focus on safety enabled our efficient restart as we followed our return-to-work playbook very, very closely.
Our focus on safety also extended to our supply chain as we work directly with our suppliers and logistics providers to minimize disruption.
In addition, our team also worked hard on costs, including capex, which helped reduce losses and cash burn in the quarter, and these factors are what led to our outperformance.
Another highlight of the quarter is our profitable commercial vehicle business.
It continues to gain share globally.
And Ford Credit, it remains a pillar of strength for our customers and it's a competitive advantage.
Overall, I'm proud to tell you that the balance sheet remains extremely solid and positions us to weather further disruptions and headwinds.
Tim will provide further details in a moment on the balance sheet.
Importantly, this intense focus on managing through the crisis has not knocked us off our mission to author our own destiny and shape the future of Ford.
Since our last earnings call, we have revealed the all-new 2021 F-150 and our new Bronco family of vehicles.
These vehicles, along with upcoming Mustang Mach-E, represent Ford's modern product vision: highly desirable iconic vehicles packed with innovation and human-centered design features.
And they're fully connected in ways that will enhance quality and constantly improving ownership experience through fast over-the-air updates.
Let me give you some color on the F-150.
The all-new version we showed in June was born from decades of deep focus on what customers want and new human-centered design capabilities that helped us invent the unobvious features and capability customers will love and value.
The new F-150 is packed with dozens of new innovative features and upgrades that we believe will make this the market-leading truck for 43 years, and that's an even stronger proposition for our customers.
We're in great shape to launch the new one, the new F-150 on time and with high quality, which, of course, requires now changeover in our plants in Dearborn and Kansas City.
Now the important sell-down of the current model is also going well as demonstrated by great news in our market share.
For example, in the U.S., while sales declined, we performed better than the industry due in part to the strength from our trucks, that being the F-150 Ranger and our SUVs, Explorer and Lincoln Aviator and Corsair.
Our total share was up 20 basis points in the quarter to 14.5%.
And within that number, our retail share was up 120 basis points to 13.3% as F-Series gained 250 basis points of segment share to 33.3%.
Turning to the all-new Bronco.
The outpouring of enthusiasm from the public and media after the reveal earlier this month, candidly, speaks for itself.
Reservations for Bronco, well, they've surpassed even our most optimistic initial projections.
Our entire team, like the over 150,000 customers who reserved one, are super excited about the Bronco.
This family of vehicles has big upside potential in the growing off-road category, and this is a category where the leading OEM has not been seriously challenged until now.
And we have proven credibility in this off-road space with Raptor, in particular.
And we are the No.
1 cross-shop brand for Jeep today.
Initial customer demand for Bronco is so high that we are actively working to increase our annual production right now.
I also want to give you a quick personal story on the status of the Mach-E, which will go on sale later this year.
I had an opportunity to drive an advanced prototype recently in Ann Arbor.
The experience was just stunning from start to finish.
When you sit in the driver's seat, everything is personalized.
My profile automatically loaded into the Mach-E before I pressed the start button.
Seat position, screen colors, preferences, Apple CarPlay and Waze were seamlessly integrated into the SYNC 4 system.
I then set off on the drive in Whisper mode.
Now the drive was astonishingly smooth and powerful.
And I used the one-pedal driving system, braking and battery regeneration were perfectly integrated.
Then I did switch to Unbridled mode.
You can see me smiling, and I can tell you the performance was pure Mustang, sure-footed and incredibly quick as I took curves.
The experience was incredibly intuitive and the cluster tells you exactly what you need to know with nothing extraneous.
Yes, I left with a big smile on my face because I know our customers will soon enjoy the same experience.
When I see these products come to life, I feel better and better about our decision to reallocate capital spending from sedans to trucks and commercial vehicles and SUVs.
It was controversial at the time.
It's paying off.
And we have even more new products in the pipeline in areas where Ford is strong today and in white spaces where we can earn stronger returns and grow share.
Now these new products are critical to our target to reduce the age of our showroom in the U.S.
by over 40% or more competitive 3.1 years by 2023.
OEMs really with the highest replacement rate and younger showroom age have generally gained market share profitably.
It's a good place to be in.
By several third-party measurements, Ford brand reputation is improving as well, and we believe we have much more potential for improvement as we launch these new exciting products.
I just want to take a moment and touch on our plan for electric vehicles.
We're about midway through our plan to invest more than $11.5 billion through 2022, and there'll be more after that with an increasing mix of spend on all-electric vehicles.
We're bringing the power of choice to our customers with hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure electric.
By the fourth quarter, we'll have 15 electrified nameplates available to customers around the world, and nearly 10% of our wholesales will have come from some form of electrification.
We're deploying this technology across our lineup and price points to bring improved capability, fuel economy and emissions to as many people as possible just as we did with our EcoBoost technology a decade ago.
Nameplates that will follow our all-electric are the Territory in China, our Escape and Kuga plug-in hybrids, which offer an estimated 100 MPGe and the F-150 PowerBoost hybrid, I just ordered one of these, as well as our Mustang Mach-E BEV.
These will be followed by an all-electric versions of our market-leading F-150 and Transit vans.
Electric vehicles are also a big part of Lincoln's future, and you'll see this unfold in the months and years ahead.
As you know, in June, we finalized our strategic alliance with VW which will accelerate execution of our commercial vehicle and electric vehicle strategy.
This alliance also significantly strengthens Argo AI, which now combines unmatched expertise with the global reach of Ford and VW together.
This positions Ford well as self-driving vehicles become a significant new source of revenue and profit in the years to come.
The AV journey will be a long one, but Ford is now well-positioned to run this race and compete like few others can.
Finally, in a moment, Tim will provide an update on the progress of our global redesign.
We're aggressively reshaping our business and restructuring underperforming operations around the world, rationalizing our product portfolio to play to our strengths and attacking costs.
Obviously, Ford isn't immune to the effect of the pandemic, including a new vehicle market that has been waylaid by the pandemic.
But we continue to manage through this crisis even as we continue to create a vibrant, profitably growing company, one that we're confident will win in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tim for more color on the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year.
Tim?
"
3135,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Thanks, Tim.
Yes, just a few comments.
I want to reinforce the following about the quarter and the second half of this year.
In the face of unprecedented sector headwinds operationally, we maintained robust safety protocols and aggressively mitigated production losses while effectively navigating a tenuous supply base.
I mean, everything was in motion.
We are keenly focused on cost and cash discipline.
Jim Farley led an effort here that's just extraordinary.
We're optimistic and ready for the production ramp-up of the F-150, the Mach-E, as you've heard, the Bronco Sport and Bronco, all with the spirit of high-quality and extreme focus on doing a great job there.
We continue important investments.
We didn't stop spending on the future, in commercial vehicles, AV, connectivity and electrification.
We did continue to implement our global redesign and portfolio refresh and we have measurable results to show that this is going very well.
And as you just heard from Tim, we did a great job of this.
We had a disciplined management of our balance sheet and an extremely strong liquidity position from all the actions we took earlier this year.
This ensures our financial flexibility particularly, as we know, in uncertain times.

But I want to make sure I'm tracking with you on Europe in the sense that you understand that structural cost effort ahead of the pandemic looks to be really prescient, doesn't it? And the absorption there without the volume is because of the effort that these guys have put forth.
So I'm not worried that, as you just portrayed, that there's a variable cost kind of avalanche that smothers us.
I don't think that's going to happen right now.
We're not anticipating a big inflation, for example.
In fact, suppliers, you know, are all trying to get back up to levels of efficiency where we start to enjoy some savings.
So I just want to add that color to the way I think about variable cost.
I understand why you were looking at the forecast, but just step back and think about that.
But Jim, do you want to talk about the Bronco great news and the challenge?
"
3140,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Hey, Adam.
It's Jim.
Thank you.
It's a question that when maybe a year ago, we started to see lines starting to arrange around make versus buy, own versus source, so we had a deep discussion about this.
I've met with a number of the people that you know that are in the supply side of this.
And it was our estimation, in fact, our whole team went through a really deep dive on this six months ago, that the supply chain has ramped up since Elon built his Gigafactory.
And so there's plenty there that does not warrant us to migrate our capital into owning our own factory.
There's no advantage in the ownership in terms of cost or sourcing as what Ford can draw on.
So I just can confirm to you that it actually works.
It works for us to go the path we are now.
With that said, there's some challenges that are in that supply chain between themselves.
There's some litigation that's going on.
We're hopeful that that gets settled quickly.
It really doesn't matter to us how it gets settled, but it confuses some of the suppliers about their investments in some of their plants here in the United States, which is another way of saying, the way the USMCA would benefit as intended is to have these factories be built in the United States for supply of batteries.
So we're well-positioned believing that will happen.
"
3141,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
So my first reaction, I think, thank god we made the decision, right, because you know what it replaced in the facility where we're making it.
Some of the sedans weren't making money.
So you got to think of that with Adam's last question about the makeup of Ford and what's going on and what's coming in, in product.
But Jim, I'll let you talk about some of our targets there.
"
3142,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"And Jim, I want to sneak in because you've all seen our campaign about we build more vehicles in America by Americans in the whole industry.
And this Bronco is, look, we're hiring people here in Southeast Michigan to build this product, 2,000 to 3,000 additional people.
I know I get teased about it because it came up in the discussion with the President, but I was just so proud to be able to explain that here we are in the middle of a pandemic with the kind of challenges in the job market and Ford is going to be hiring people to build this product.
So it's really a great news story.
"
3143,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
Jim, do you want to take that one?
"
3144,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Well, I think Jim mentioned this, and Tim did, is that South America, the journey there, as compared to some of the other markets, started, we phased out of unprofitable vehicles.
We ended Focus production and Pacheco exited heavy trucks business, discontinued Fiesta, ceased operations at Sao Paulo manufacturing, phased out the Sigma engine production.
But Jim's been really working hard on the restructuring to serve our dealer network better in terms of their customers and improving the viability for the remaining dealers.
So I think this is a story that's still yet to be completed.
But Jim, I want to let you answer why you think in the short term we had this better-than-expected performance.
"
3145,F,2020,2,jim-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Well, I'm excited to tell you that the plan is working there.
COVID was -- it kind of help focus us.
But the commercial vehicles' strength was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, which gained 40 basis points of share.
It's the second consecutive quarter of share gain, up 20 basis points, which is what you're hinting about.
We were talking about it in a way that this was the breakthrough that we were looking for.
And then Corsair comes in the middle of this.
It's the first locally produced Lincoln product, and it breaks all records that we've had in one month for the sale of a product like that.
It contributed to the 12% increase in sales for Lincoln.
And now the new Aviator is following on.
My only regret is that the whole Board was going to be there in October just to kind of review the progress that you're noting, and we can't travel now because of COVID.
But Jim Farley and Anning Chen, our president there, have done a really good job of getting our arms around that market.
"
3146,F,2020,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks very much.
My first question is on EV batteries.
It's kind of a question about make versus buy.
So GM is making their own batteries with a joint venture in Ohio with LG.
You're not going that route in terms of owning the physical plant capacity.
What drives that thinking? And specifically, there's a lot of options.
And this isn't the only one, but Elon Musk has offered to sell batteries or like EV powertrain skateboards to other OEMS, would you consider doing that?
"
3147,F,2020,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Thanks, Jim.
And then I got a follow-up for Jim Farley.
Jim, and I'm asking you specifically just because you're kind of -- I'll still consider you new in your role, your new role.

Good afternoon.
Thank you very much.
I've got a couple of questions.
One is, when I listen to you, Tim, about the Q4 guidance going back into loss because of launch costs, it seems like another assumption is also a weaker Q4.
It seems like it's not set that you're definitely going back into loss.
A lot would depend potentially on the SAAR.
I wonder if you can comment and give us some kind of guidance on the range of outcomes potentially.
And my other question was also to you in terms of, you've done quite an impressive work in terms of protecting cash and also starting to deleverage the capital structure.
I couldn't help noticing your interest expense almost doubled in Q2.
That was a point of discussion with a lot investors, the interest expense we put into earnings momentum.
What are you doing? And how quickly can you actually get the interest expense under control so we can make sure we don't lose the operating leverage into the financial leverage?

3153,F,2020,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, guys.
Just a first question, Tim.
As we look at sort of the guidance you had given us on the second quarter, you kind of blew it out of the water here.
I mean, you're talking about a $5 billion-plus EBIT loss and you came in well better than that.
I'm just curious, what changed? And what do you think the major factors are? And then also, I mean, if you think about price and cost, which seem to be two big levers.
How sticky could those benefits be going forward? So really just what changed and how durable is the change?
"
3154,F,2020,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"Yeah.
How sticky is that sort of that outperformance because it does sound like a lot of it was micro.
And as you said, just execution.
I mean, do you think some of that was sort of transitory in response to sort of austerity measures or how sticky is this?
"
3155,F,2020,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"OK.
And then just a second question, I think, Jim Farley is on.
When we look at the Bronco launch, a lot of hype around the truck, which is, at least, from my opinion, is well deserved.
A lot of excitement there around the Sport as well this year.
But it seems like this is sort of the start of something much more than even just those two vehicles when you talk about the Bronco family.
So just trying to understand, will we be looking at something four, five, six years down the line where there could be a portfolio of Bronco vehicles that mimics or mirrors sort of more what Jeep has? I'm just trying to understand what the potential is above and beyond what we know at the moment and it seems like there's a lot more on the horizon.

3158,F,2020,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank-securities,True,0,"Hi.
Good evening, everybody.
My first question is, I'm trying to understand a little bit better how do you think about the rest of the year.
When I look at your cost performance in the quarter, maybe on Slide 11, so $1.1 billion overall on net basis, but $1.8 billion qualified as structural.
Any way to dimension for us how much of those structural costs are more temporary actions in the quarter when you had shutdowns for an extended period of time versus something that we could assume could continue on a year-over-year basis going forward? And then still about the rest of the year's outlook any way for you to dimension for us the magnitude of the impact from the F-150 changeover either in terms of weeks of shutdown or units, anything that could be helpful to dimension it?
"
3159,F,2020,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank-securities,True,1,"The second part was around the F-150 changeover.
"
3160,F,2020,2,emmanuel-rosner,deutsche-bank-securities,True,2,"OK.
Thank you.
And then I was hoping to get, actually, a little bit more from your latest thoughts on the global redesign plan and the opportunity to use this industry downturn potentially to accelerate this.
I guess, in terms of the -- I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks that you expect $1 billion of benefit by the end of the year.
I wanted to just first understand on what basis that is? Is it for 2020 versus 2019 or is it since the beginning of the program? And how to think about the opportunity to accelerate it, what are your latest thoughts there?

Good evening, everyone.
Thank you for taking the question.
I wanted to start with a question on Bronco here.
And I know you don't disclose your exact variable profit per unit, but maybe you could just give us a sense from the perspective of variable profit per unit how we should think of where Bronco potentially could stack up versus other vehicles in the Ford lineup? Obviously, it's not going to be at the level of F-Series or I would think that to be the case.
But I would venture to guess, though, that it could be right up there, maybe above an Explorer or just below an Expedition or Navigator.
Just give us some sense of, from a profit per unit standpoint, how we should be thinking about Bronco and the opportunities? We know that your competitor in this area is doing quite well in that product.
"
3164,F,2020,2,dan-levy,credit-suisse,True,1,"Thank you.
That's really helpful color.
If I could just squeeze one more in on EV and just a question on EV budgeting.
Your release said you spent half of the $11.5 billion electrification commitment through '22.
And I believe that the starting point was '16, so it tells us clearly your spend is more back-end loaded.
But obviously, 2022 is not an end goal.
You're going to be spending, EV.
You're just starting on the journey then.
So is it fair to assume that if I assume, OK, so you still have $3 billion to $4 billion -- $3-plus billion a year that the spend will only accelerate after 2022? So just how to think of the electrification spend?

Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's second-quarter 2020 earnings call.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our president and CEO; and Tim Stone, our chief financial officer.
Also joining us today for Q&A are Jim Farley, chief operating officer; and Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with some color on the quarter, and then Tim will talk about our results in more depth, and then we'll turn to Q&A.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S.
GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations.
Actual results may differ from those stated, and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 23.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year.
Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume weighted basis.
A quick update on two upcoming IR events.
First, on Monday, August 3, RBC will host a fireside chat with us: Tim Stone; Hau Thai-Tang, our Chief Product Development and Procurement Officer; and Gary Johnson, our Chief Manufacturing and Labor Affairs Officer, will participate.
And then on Wednesday, August 15, Kumar Galhotra, President, Americas and International Markets Group, will participate in the Jefferies Industrial Conference.

Good evening, everyone.
Just a couple of cash flow questions maybe for Tim.
I think year to date, the working capital and timing differences has been a use of about almost $5 billion.
Curious if you can share roughly how much of that you think you might be able to recover in the second half of the year? And then secondly to that, with the capex coming down from the original guidance, should we expect that to be recovered next year, meaning capex would be higher than normal as you kind of recoup some of the deferrals from this year?

3173,F,2020,2,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
First, on South America, I would have expected your losses there to grow considerably in 2Q given the 75% decline in revenue, but instead profitability improved slightly.
Now it looks like more of the help was coming from price than cost.
But how would you rate the progress of the restructuring in that region? Are there more cost savings to come from actions already announced but not fully implemented? And do you think you're at the point now that if the volume returned that you would already be profitable or are there more restructuring actions needed to get there?
"
3174,F,2020,2,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,"That's helpful.
Thanks.
And then just lastly, it seems like your market share in China is beginning to rebound.
What would you primarily attribute the recovery to? Is it the products, the relationship with Changan, distribution strategy, localization of Lincoln, etc.? And then are the pieces or future product programs in place to continue to grow that share, which I think had been like 4% at one point? Is there a market share target that you have in mind that is materially higher than where you are now, such that you could continue to grow your sales in that country even if the market sort of languishes for a while?

Hi.
As Jim and Tim mentioned, the Bronco reception has been very positive.
The reservation numbers are far beyond what we expected.
And these are two broad appeal nameplates in three body styles that we don't have in our portfolio today.
So we're not getting ahead of ourselves on Bronco.
We have a lot of work to do to launch these products, to do it with world-class quality.
And don't forget, our ambition is to launch over 200 accessories and really create a brand, a sub-brand within Ford like we have like F-Series.
So we have a lot to do, and that's what we're focused on.
John, there is no shortage of great ideas for Broncos at Ford Motor Company, but we have a great foundation to start with, with these three body styles.
I would expect Ford, like we've always done, like we've learned from F-Series over the years, decades, that we'll roll out a family of Broncos like we're doing in our own way, targeted to our own customers, where we see openings in the market for customers to be thrilled.
And we do see that opportunity in the market.
So I wouldn't hold ourselves or benchmark ourselves against another OEM.
Our idea is to play to win by going after specific customers that are underserved.
Thanks.
"
3178,F,2020,2,jim-farley,chief-operating-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
Thanks, Jim.
Hi, Rod.
So MAP, right down the street from our Dearborn headquarters, is where we will make Bronco, as you know, in North America, and then the Bronco Sport down in Mexico.
As far as the Bronco that we've received, over 100,000 reservations.
That operation is on a two shift pattern.
So we have some upside.
We have a lot of work to do because these are reservations, not orders yet.
So we have a lot of work to do to verify that.
The mix is great and the enthusiasm.
And we still continue to get lots of reservations.
So the team has multiple capacity studies.
We do have some opportunity.
It would commit to another shift, which is a big deal for us, as you can imagine.
But obviously, the reception has been really positive and looks sustained now.
On F-150, we're in the prototype build, both in Kentucky and in Dearborn, looks great.
We're on plan with the supplier readiness, manufacturer readiness and all the software.
Obviously, this is a big milestone for OTA and a lot of software for us.
So it's an important deliverable for the team.
And we have a long way to go on the F-150 launch, but the team has made great progress.
We're finding issues and addressing them immediately.
So we're feeling like, I would portray it as on plan.
And yeah, there's upside for Bronco.
"
3179,F,2020,2,jim-farley,chief-operating-officer,False,2,"Thanks, Adam.
Yeah.
I would characterize Ford's transformation as, we know what we're really good at and we have tremendous opportunity to grow in those areas.
And commercial is a great example.
It took us decades to build the commercial ecosystem we have today, the exclusive distribution, bailment, upfitters, deep relationship with customers, real deep know-how in the company.
As we look forward in the next three to five years, you can expect Ford's commercial business to change a lot.
And part of that is cooperation with Volkswagen in places like Europe, but other parts will be the e-mobility transformation of commercial.
So I would say, Adam, you can expect Ford's transformation to be in the areas that we're already really good at.
We have capability.
And that we're humbly approaching the business model and the ecosystem build-out for those new growth opportunities with a fresh set of eyes.
And just like we did decades ago when we built these businesses like commercial, a tremendous opportunity for value creation and for our customers, especially.
I think that gives you a good taste for how we see things, as well as a much tighter geographic profile.
"
3180,F,2020,2,jim-farley,chief-operating-officer,False,3,"Sure.
Thanks, Jim.
Appreciate the question.
The real breakthrough for us on Bronco was the localization of the Ranger, the very successful global Ranger here in North America.
We already have very strong scale and performance with the Ranger in the U.S.
Large Bronco and the C2-based Bronco Sport are both based on existing platforms that we have executed many times.
And so we're not going to go into specific profitability, but you can imagine, compared to a Ranger, the kind of pricing that a Bronco top hat would get.
And obviously, we already have a great scale for the actual industrial part of the product so.
And again, the platform has been very well executed.
It has global scale as does C2 for the Bronco Sport.
And the pricing premium we carry in the utility market, the off-road market, is pretty well known.
And I would say, very robust in terms of, we've delivered it.
It's not a maybe.
So from our standpoint, as Jim said, we not only replaced the Focus in the case of Bronco and Ranger, but we're coming off of very high scale platforms, C2 and Ranger, and we know that these segments executed right, the product are premium segments.
So we're feeling really good about the margin.
"
3181,F,2020,2,jim-farley,chief-operating-officer,False,4,"Sure.
Again, appreciate your question.
Yeah.
Obviously, of the $11 billion, we're at the very tail end of Mach-E and our two commercial vehicles.
And they're really key for us, the commercial vehicles, the Transit electric and the F-150 electric.
We've announced the MEB and a number of nameplates.
And so you can expect in '22 and beyond as we refresh our product lineup once again globally that electrification will be a key component.
And so the spend will continue to play out.
That figure was given a few years ago.
So as you said, '22 seems like right around the corner, but we're not done.
And with the $11 billion, we have some really exciting products coming up like the F-150 and the Transit.
And with the growth of package delivery and a large commercial customer network for F-150, we're are seeing a ton of interest from customers on both of those.
But we have lots of passenger cars to come as well.
We're not going to be specific more than what we've shared, but I think you've characterized it fairly and accurately.
"
3182,F,2020,2,jim-farley,chief-operating-officer,False,5,"Thanks, Jim.
The second-quarter marks, I think, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements, although still losses.
And it really reflects, as Jim said, the progress that we put in place many years ago to restructure South America.
We had a lot of cost containment.
We've taken a lot of headcount out of the business, as you would expect.
And we've also, in the second quarter, took a lot of pricing, which is consistent with the currency situation down there.
But I think Lyle and the team got ahead of the downturn we saw in the market with COVID.
That's been a big beneficiary for us for a while.
As Jim said, we're going to keep restructuring our businesses until they're sustainable.
So still more work to do.
South America looks pretty challenging.
But the team is doing a great job.
We had a flurry of new products a few years ago, and there was cost associated with that.
So I think we have a really good, still fresh lineup.
We gained a lot of share in the second quarter.
It was down about one point from last year, but that was a lot to do with the vehicles that we discontinued.
So the vehicles we do have are very well accepted.
I just would portray it as, we have more work to do, as Jim said, but a really big credit to the team in way down revenues to have a third consecutive improvement in our profit or losses.
"
3183,F,2020,2,jim-farley,chief-operating-officer,False,6,"Yeah.
Thanks.
One of the really encouraging things for us and the leadership team, as Jim said, as we went out and promoted the reality that we're the highest employment in the U.S.
of all the OEMs and also our volume in the U.S.
And that plus new products really, we've seen the strengthening of our brand.
The Promise campaign seems to be doing really well.
We had a great second quarter in terms of share performance in the U.S.
Retail, as Jim said, was way up a full point.
And part of that was mix, but it's great to see the momentum behind the brand.
Third quarter looks not to be dramatically different.
We continue to have good momentum.
Sales, still a lot to do.
We have good supply situation at Ford in the 70-day range.
And so the campaign seems to be doing really well.
Brand is getting stronger and we have product to sell.

"
3186,F,2020,2,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"OK.
And then maybe just on cash flow and the balance sheet.
So you paid back part of the revolver.
If we pro forma that for the June cash and debt levels you indicated, you're sort of back to the December net cash levels.
But then you do have at least some losses, right, in the fourth quarter or there's more capex.
There's a little bit more redesign cash this year, and I still think more beyond this year.
I know you sort of usually talk about liquidity, not necessarily sort of net automotive cash or debt.
But how do you see that sort of playing out? How do you see the balance sheet sort of playing out over the next couple of years because there still are some calls on the cash, it would seem.

In addition to our operational execution this quarter, in the face of unprecedented industry headwinds, our results demonstrated progress as we fix areas of the business that have held us back in the past, including cost and launch execution, an acceleration in areas of strength like commercial vehicles and SUVs, as well as newer capabilities like connectivity.
Tangible progress in electrification and autonomous vehicles, both essential to our long-term growth.
And lastly, the favorable impact of our global redesign and a more focused portfolio of fresh products for customers.
We also demonstrated discipline in the management of our balance sheet and continue to maintain strong liquidity to ensure financial flexibility in these uncertain times.
We ended the quarter with over $39 billion in cash and liquidity, reflecting almost $10 billion of new debt in the quarter, including the $8 billion unsecured issuance we completed in April.
During the second quarter, our working capital dynamics played out as we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call.
As production resumed in mid-May, our payables and cash balance recovered sharply.
The restoration of production payables will continue into the third quarter as we reach near full production in late June.
On July 27, we repaid $7.7 billion of our outstanding $15.4 billion corporate revolvers.
We also extended $4.8 billion of our lines of credit from April '22 to July '23.
Our current liquidity of almost $40 billion is sufficient to maintain or exceed our target cash balance of $20 billion through the second half of this year even if global demand declines or if there's another wave of COVID-related plant closures.
Looking at our results in automotive, both wholesales and revenue were down due to the suspension in manufacturing.
To give you some color on wholesales, earlier this year, pre-COVID, we expected wholesale units to be about 800,000 higher than the 645,000 we reported in the quarter.
Our decline in Automotive EBIT was driven by the decline in volume, but this was partially offset by over a $1 billion improvement in both net pricing and cost.
The cost improvement was the net of four primary areas: lower structural costs due to suspended production and one-time cost actions like reduced marketing, both of which were partially offset by higher material costs for new products and regulatory compliance and higher warranty.
We do expect warranty to be up for the year.
Looking at our business units in more detail.
North America was shut down for six weeks in the quarter, but like the other regions, manufacturing came up smoothly.
In fact, North America was operating at about 95% of pre-COVID production levels by the end of the quarter.
In addition to the improvements in share that Jim mentioned, the North America team is laser-focused on minimizing the impacts of lower volume through the aggressive management of costs, including reducing facility costs, media spend and the elimination of all discretionary spending.
The team also focused on yield management actions, which benefit both revenue and EBIT.
In South America, our plants were mostly idled in the quarter.
But as with North America, we brought production up efficiently.
Market share declined largely driven by lower sales to rental companies and our global redesign actions last year to exit heavy trucks and unprofitable products such as Fiesta and Focus.
However, both Ranger and EcoSport did well as Ranger, the No.
2 midsized pickup globally, gained share.
Relative to profitability, this was the third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year results as we continue to hone our cost position, including lower headcount and improved mix.
In Europe, all of our plants came up successfully by May 4.
Profitability was favorably impacted by the benefits of our global redesign, as well as our more focused approach on three customer segments: commercial vehicles, select passenger vehicles and imports.
Relative to global redesign, we are on track to deliver by the end of this year roughly a $1 billion improvement in structural cost since the actions began during the third quarter of 2018.
This includes 10,000 positions in Western Europe, of which 7,500 reductions have been completed and a reduction of over 2,000 positions in Europe.
The balance of the positions in Western Europe will be eliminated by the end of this year.
We've also reduced costs by reducing our manufacturing footprint by six facilities down to a total of 17.
Our sharper focus on product strength allow us to extend our leadership in commercial vehicles as we reached 15.1% share in June, an increase of 220 basis points.
We are on track this year to meet the new CO2 regulatory requirements for both passenger and commercial vehicles, supported by our growing portfolio of electrified vehicles.
For example, in the first half of this year, our new Puma MHEV reached 80% mix, and Kuga PHEV and MHEV collectively reached 57% mix.
And on the horizon, a BEV Transit will join our Transit family of ICE and hybrid powertrains.
In China, the only region to post a gain in wholesales, wholesales were up double digits as we benefited from the newly launched Escape and Lincoln Corsair and strong commercial vehicle sales.
Corsair, our first locally produced Lincoln product, contributed to a 12% increase in sales for Lincoln.
And the all-new locally produced Aviator is launching now.
China also posted its second consecutive quarter of share gain, up 20 basis points to 2.5%, its highest market share since the third quarter of 2018.
Our strength in commercial vehicles was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, our JV partner, which gained 40 basis points of share.
As with other regions, through cost discipline, China has done a great job mitigating the profit impact of COVID.
China's focus on cash flow also delivered a step function change in working capital, driven by the benefits of localization, as well as capex efficiencies.
In Mobility, we continue to make investments to commercialize our autonomous vehicle business, including product development, engineering and testing.
Our six test markets for Argo AI constitute what we believe is the largest active urban test footprint of any self-driving vehicle developer.
As Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we closed our new partnership with VW and Argo AI.
This generated a gain of $3.5 billion, which was recorded as a special item.
Argo AI, which is the self-driving system portion of our AV business, is now deconsolidated.
Despite the deconsolidation, we do expect our investment in AV reflected in our consolidated Mobility results to continue at similar levels for the reasons I noted earlier.
In Mobility, we also continue to invest to build out capabilities in connected services, including our FordPass and Ford Commercial Solutions platforms.
In fact, we have centralized our enterprise connectivity team to accelerate the delivery of human-centered connected experiences for our customers.
We expect this sharpened focus to also provide benefits to the enterprise through improved customer experience and quality.
Ford Credit delivered a strong profitable quarter, demonstrating its uniquely compelling value for customers and competitive advantage.
Our prudent actions in the first quarter ensured we were adequately reserved in light of the macro uncertainty created by COVID.
Portfolio performance was strong and delinquencies and charge-offs were record low levels.
Ford Credit provided extensions to about 11% of U.S.
customers through May, an unprecedented move.
Over 90% of these customers have resumed payments without delinquency and we're very pleased with the performance of this portfolio.
Lease share remained below industry average, and off-lease auction performance was better than expected, up 3% sequentially and down 2% year over year.
We began the quarter with closed auctions, growing inventory and falling prices.
However, in May, we saw a healthy recovery in auction volume and prices.
At present, we forecast lower auction values for the full year of about 5%, consistent with third-party estimates.
Now let me turn to guidance.
Guidance assumes no meaningful change to the current economic environment, continued steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or distribution.
In the third quarter, we expect to be profitable with adjusted EBIT of $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion, reflecting the economic impact of COVID, weaker global demand for new vehicles, parts and services and lower profit from Ford Credit.
Our recent practice has been to comment on the upcoming quarter only.
But because of the significant launch activity in the fourth quarter, we thought some early color would be helpful.
We expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss in the fourth quarter, driven by the volume impact of the new F-150 launch, and lower ongoing industry volumes.
Note that our major launches in North America have shifted to the fourth quarter, in line with our COVID-related production disruption.
We anticipate that downtime, changeover and ramp up will reduce F-150 wholesale significantly in the quarter.
This launch impact will more than offset the nonrecurrence of the 2019 UAW contract bonuses in the fourth quarter, which is worth roughly $600 million.
While the new Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E are also launching in the quarter, the limited level of wholesales will not have a material impact on our fourth-quarter results.
We also expect lower Ford Credit profits in the fourth quarter versus last year.
All that said, we expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss for the full year.
I'm optimistic that we're well-positioned for what lies ahead and to deliver excellent products and services for our customers.
With that, let me turn the call back to Jim for a few comments before we move to Q&A.
"
3190,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Great.
Ultimately, the performance of the second quarter comes down to operational execution by the teams.
And if you look at our return to work, we did so not only safely, but production and our wholesale vehicle sales came with that and inventory management, really strong performance by the teams.
We were near full production by the end of the quarter and with greater cost reductions and cash reductions than we had anticipated initially as well, again, based on that keen focus on cost and cash.
It was also a favorable pricing environment for products and mix.
And then Ford Credit, the auction values and credit losses, the overall portfolio performance was strong.
So I guess, at the end of the day, it's strong execution.
And the second part of your question, again, was as it relates to how much of that is going to prevail beyond the year?
"
3191,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Let me start with the last part first, thanks for the question.
We haven't completed our planning process for next year yet.
We have said for some time now that we're focused on fitness activities, which not only includes cost but also capex, to make sure that we're efficiently and effectively allocating capital.
So we'll continue to focus on that.
And you're seeing some of that reflected in the results on capex this year.
So fitness, you're also seeing the ebb and flow of product programs.
But we're pleased with the progress that we're making, $1 billion to $1.5 billion down year over year.
But again, nothing further to share at this stage on 2021.
As far as working capital goes, bear in mind, in the second quarter, the working capital dynamics played out that we talked about, production resumed.
Of course, during the shutdown period, we had payables we repaid.
And as production resumes, those payables start getting built back up.
But the restoration of payables will continue into the third quarter.
And that's one of the reasons we said that the third-quarter cash flow will be better than EBIT and the fourth-quarter cash flow with the shutdown seasonally and the launches that are happening, particularly the F-150, this cash flow would be lower than EBIT.
So I guess what you're seeing is not only the benefits from our fitness and our redesign and our underlying results improving in light of the COVID environment, but even underlying that that will continue to play out for the back half of this year and then into '21 as we're keenly focused on cost and cash opportunities.
But as we talked about earlier, we're in a position now where we have a very strong cash position and liquidity position, and we're comfortable with the outlook as we look ahead.
"
3192,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,3,
3193,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,4,"I think the operational execution is something we pride ourselves on and expect to work really hard to make sure it's very sticky.
We've got a lot of work ahead of us, for sure, in the back half of the year with some really important launches in the fourth quarter and continue to drive improvements and to fix, accelerate and grow areas that we've talked about.
But reflected in our guidance for profitability in the third quarter is that we're going to continue to operate in an operationally excellent manner.
"
3194,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yup.
Great.
Thanks, Jim.
So as it relates to the cost actions we've been taking, we've been talking about, for some time now, is the focus on fitness and design of the business.
And so we're going to continue to be passionately focused on making sure the right design for the business and with fitness as a priority.
And so certainly, there are things that we appropriately undertook to preserve cash and reduce cost in response to the environment.
But we're also looking at opportunities to learn from this and identify areas to further accelerate our fitness and redesign opportunities that are ahead.
So that's really what I had to say in that.
Otherwise, this is actually reflected in the guidance we have for the third and fourth quarters as we look out.
And on the third -- go ahead.
"
3195,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yeah.
On the F-150 side, what we tried to do is characterize it as more impactful than the UAW launch essentially -- sorry, UAW contract bonuses of $600 million.
So beyond that, there's not much more we can say.
Certainly, when you have America's best-selling vehicle for 38 years and gaining share with F-Series in the quarter, you can see the popularity of that vehicle is quite meaningful to our overall business.
So ramp down and ramp back up with a successful launch will have a big impact on the quarter, which is why we're expecting to have a loss.
"
3196,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Yeah.
So as it relates to the Europe comment, by the end of this year, we expect to have roughly $1 billion improvement in structural cost actions since the beginning of when it was announced in Q3 '18.
It's cumulative.
And that includes the reduction of the positions I mentioned, 10,000 positions in Western Europe, 7,500 of which have been completed already, as well as 2,000 positions in Russia, as well as the reduction in manufacturing footprint by six facilities to a total of 17.
So again, we're going to, just repeat what I said earlier, we're going to continue to look at opportunities to make sure we have the right design for the business as we look out at the opportunities ahead of us.
And nothing incremental to announce at this moment.
But to date, we've incurred $3.9 billion of EBIT charges and $1.4 billion of cash.
So we got up to $7.1 billion to go in charges and up to $5.6 billion in cash.
And the other thing is, we continue to execute on the redesign of South America as well.
So nothing new to announce at this time, but we're keenly focused on it.
"
3197,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,8,"Great.
So let me start with the interest expense.
It has ticked up as we bolstered our balance sheet and ensure we have not only a strong cash position, a strong liquidity position, and it suits us very well.
And then as we looked out, we feel comfortable with our cash position and confident such that we repaid roughly half of the outstanding revolvers that we drew down earlier this week.
And we'll continue to look at opportunities to repay additional debt, including revolvers over time, as the business performs.
And we don't have anything to announce at this time.
But certainly, we'll be looking at opportunities to reduce interest expense and delever the balance sheet in that way.
Bear in mind, as the debt levels come down, of course, we have the $40 billion of liquidity as we repaid a lot of the credit.
So I feel, as I said, comfortable with our cash and liquidity position.
The interest expense for the back half of the year, you can assume roughly $0.5 billion per quarter will be a reasonable expectation.
And then your question on SAAR.
Year to date, SAAR is about 13.4 million units in the first half.
And we see this improving throughout the year.
And beyond that, I think we'll add more color as the year progresses, but we do see, again, an opportunity for it to improve as the year progresses.
"
3198,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah.
I guess what I'd say is, the team has been very focused on opportunities, not just during this time of COVID crisis, but before that, to get more fit and improve our cost structure.
You're seeing that in our underlying results entering into the crisis.
With the crisis, we've had an opportunity to further reassess how we work, what opportunities we have in our cost structure, to demonstrate it to ourselves, we can take swift action.
And the team, again, the teams around the world have done a great job in all areas.
We're certainly mindful of what you're suggesting that these costs come back in the cost structure in ways that are unwelcome.
But we're going to do everything we can to make sure that -- well, it's certain if they're volume-related costs, but that we're going to get more and more fit over time.
"
3199,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,10,"It's hard for me to undo what's happened over the past few months.
The delays that we're having are commensurate with what happened as a result of the production shutdown.
And the teams throughout that time frame did a great job getting us ready for launch.
If you look at the back half of the year in aggregate, we're essentially guiding to less than $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion of profit.
And certainly, there's been a shift to the fourth quarter as a result of those launch delays and the big impact of F-150 being in the fourth quarter.
"
3200,F,2020,2,tim-stone,chief-financial-officer,False,11,"Yeah.
I mean, first, I want to emphasize, for the third quarter, we expect cash flow to be higher than EBIT, and the fourth quarter would be lower due to the timing of the working capital associated with the launches and the seasonal effects.
As you look further out, from a liquidity standpoint, we have, of course, confidence in our ability to repay the debt that we have.
We have net debt of roughly equal to cash.
And what we said was that, even in scenarios where we have COVID-related plant closures again and/or demand declines, we would have $20 billion or more in cash.
So certainly, our base expectation is for more than that.
And as we look out to the future, we're focused on optimizing our free cash flow, driving toward our long-term margin opportunities.
And with that will come even greater cash and liquidity opportunities for us to consider not only paying down lines of credit, of course, but paying debt, reinstating the dividend and anti-dilutive share repurchases as well.
"
3201,F,2018,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,0,"Hi, everybody.
Can you hear me?
"
3202,F,2018,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,1,"I know who I am and you know who I am so that's all that counts.
So, thanks for taking my questions.
First, just a housekeeping item.
I presume that the $700 million warranty item in the quarter was Takata and that the underlying North American performance excluding that was closer to 10%.
Is that right?
"
3203,F,2018,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,2,"Yeah.
The fourth quarter looked like it had a big number in it, though, on a year-over-year basis.
"
3204,F,2018,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,3,"Yeah.
And just at a higher level, you're talking about an 8% margin, presumably, at some point beyond 2020.
On your revenue base today, that would be $13 billion of EBIT.
You're doing $10 billion in trucks and $3 billion in the FinCo so that kind of makes sense.
But to get from here to there, you need to improve by $5 billion or $6 billion.
Obviously, people have been a bit frustrated by how long it takes to get some of these things together, the savings that you're working on, but I was hoping you can maybe flesh out a little bit more on this and on how we should be thinking about the cadence of improvement.
It sounds like the first thing that comes through is product, not so much cost savings.
Can you maybe talk a little bit more about that and how that plays out in 2019? Because it seems like there's some big products, like Ranger, that come in.
And then as we look out to 2020, could those other elements, the savings and the exits from certain markets, do those really start to move the needle materially in just a year from now or does that take longer?
"
3205,F,2018,4,rod-lache,wolfe-research,True,4,
3206,F,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-&-co.,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for taking my questions here.
Jim, the way you kind of communicated how you think about 2018 as a year and 2017 as a year of kind of planning from a redesign perspective, if we were to fast-forward to the end of 2019, and maybe into the middle of 2020, will 2019 be known as an action year for Ford?
"
3207,F,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-&-co.,True,1,"Understood.
My question was a little bit more around the restructuring side.
If we kind of think about Ford's footprint today and Ford's footprint or what it's going to start to look like by the end of this year, you're expecting material changes, is what you're implying.
"
3208,F,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-&-co.,True,2,"I think I would agree with that.
Thanks for the additional color, Bob.
My second question is really quarter-related and kind of go-forward for China.
Can you walk us through the headwinds for that JV income, which took another sequential step down to pretty seriously negative for 4Q '18? And how you think about the cadence to improvement if that's the level that we should probably start out in 1Q.
And as you launch new products and fill out that whole sales and dealer pipeline, if that's going to turn around the business?
"
3209,F,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-&-co.,True,3,"Understood.
And if I could just sneak one last one in, are there are any type of legacy costs outside of employment contracts that would impede Ford from fully exiting any particular region?
"
3210,F,2018,4,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs-&-co.,True,4,
3211,F,2018,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Hey, everybody.
It's Adam.
Thanks for taking my question.
First, to go back to the balance sheet and investment grade priorities that you communicated in Detroit, what is a higher priority: sustaining the current dividend or maintaining investment grade?
"
3212,F,2018,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"You can rap it if you want, Bob.
"
3213,F,2018,4,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"Yes, Jim.

"
3215,F,2018,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, guys.
I just wanted to focus on one thing first -- on the big positive being mix and price.
I mean, the industry has been more disciplined and things have been a bit better, particularly in North America, as you kind of highlighted.
I'm just curious, when you look at your aged product on a relative basis, what do you think the key driver was that gave you just such significant strong price and mix through 2018 in North America, specifically, and even in the fourth quarter? I mean, is stuff going on in SVT or other things? What was the big driver there?
"
3216,F,2018,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"Okay.
That's incredibly helpful.
Then just a second question.
As we look at the cash flow in the year, it was not the greatest this year.
And if you look at the funding of the dividend, it was largely off the cash on the balance sheet.
I think there is some concern in the rating agencies that if you don't get your plan worked out and really turn the cash flow around that you're going to continue to pay the dividend off the balance sheet and then fund the restructuring from the cash on the balance sheet.
I mean, from where you stand right now, the balance sheet looks like it's in great shape.
It doesn't seem like there's really significant risk but the rating agencies seem to be a little bit concerned about this.
I'm just curious how fast you think you can get the cash flow turned so that you can fund the restructuring and the dividend out of operating cash flow as opposed to the cash on the balance sheet and really solve the riddle for the rating agencies.
"
3217,F,2018,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"Jim, one just maybe big picture question.
As you look at his -- and, I mean, you've kind of been on this job and there's been some frustration of the plan and there's a lot going on in the industry on AVs and EVs and what's going on in China.
As you look at sort of the North Star of where you need to go, going forward, is it ultimately really just product cadence that is 90% of the game and the rest is 10%? We just went through a pretty tough period for Ford on the product cadence.
Now we're staring down the barrel, at least in North America and China, at some big stuff coming at us.
I mean, is it really -- I mean, that's very complicated stuff but is it really that simple though?
"
3218,F,2018,4,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,
3219,F,2018,4,james-d.-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,0,"Thank you, Bob, and good evening.
Let's turn to Slide 15.
Before I dive into the actions we're taking in China and Europe, I would be remiss if I didn't put a finer point on the opportunity in North America this year and our 10% EBIT margin target.
Last year, North America delivered $2 billion in favorable market factors, as was mentioned, supported by positive mix and pricing from a largely carryover product lineup, like F Series, and modest new product launches, like the new Expedition Edge and Navigator.
This year, we're beginning our complete refresh of our North America lineup.
As Jim mentioned, we're adding Ranger, which is off to a great start, to our truck lineup.
We have the new reengineered, rear-wheel drive Explorer, America's all-time best-selling SUV.
We have brand new hybrid and performance models of Explorer.
We have a wonderful new three-row Aviator, which is a new nameplate for Lincoln.
And later in the year, we have the all-new Escape and Escape Hybrid, which will be a new product in the largest segment in our industry.
We even have at the end of the year another all-new Lincoln utility.
So, let's turn to China.
Obviously, China is the largest automotive market in the world and we think it could be twice the size of the U.S.
by 2025.
So getting our business back on track is essential, given our plan to grow both brands in China.
Last year, as we discussed with you, we identified a number of operating shortfalls, including inadequate dealer profitability.
We had excess stock, especially of our high-volume C cars.
These deficits were exacerbated by the fact that we had not maintained a fresh lineup.
In fact, all of our volume cars were in sell-down last year.
Also, our structural costs were not aligned with our volume and we lacked a strong bench of local leadership.
Well, we've been working tirelessly and urgently to address each of these issues with a focus to restoring profitable growth immediately.
At the core is having an engaged and profitable dealer network.
For example, by the end of last year, just about a third of our dealers are not profitable and we expect this positive trend to steadily increase this year with our new lineup.
Relative to inventories, in the fourth quarter, we reduced our aged inventories by roughly 60% quarter-over-quarter.
And as we prepare to clear the decks for an all-new product lineup, this is critical.
This includes as well the launch of the all-new Escape and Focus, both of which produced a double-digit increase in transaction prices last quarter.
These are really encouraging results.
We're also, on top of these products, adding more than 10 new Ford and Lincoln products to China through our distribution network.
We're also aggressively tackling costs in China.
Simply by sourcing from true local Chinese supply base, we will cut our material costs and we are targeting significant reductions in structural costs for our consolidated operations.
Lastly, to ensure China receives the proper focus, we've broken it out as a separate business unit, reporting to me, and we have local China talent in key management positions, such as Anning Chen, our new CEO, as well as new marketing and sales leads for both Ford and Lincoln.
Let's turn to Europe.
I've said in the past, to deliver on our long-term target of 6% EBIT, we are now redesigning our European operations.
The core of this is to leverage our profitable, light commercial van and pickup business and aggressively attack costs and drive improved capital efficiencies.
Earlier this month, on January 10, we announced our plan to achieve this, including a much more targeted vehicle lineup with three customer-centric business units.
And most importantly, we're standing up a dedicated light commercial vehicle group with its own general manager.
We're also addressing our cost structure head on.
We've already begun the formal consultation process with our key union partners in Europe.
Turning to the core of our portfolio in Europe, last year marked our fifth consecutive year of growth in share in the light commercial vehicle business and we plan to extend that lead as Europe's No.
1 light commercial vehicle brand this year, including key product improvements on Ranger and Transit later this year.
With passenger cars, we will reduce our lineup while focusing on higher margin series mix, such as our new Fiesta and Focus ST and active derivatives.
Now, relative to profitability, we are prioritizing our higher margin markets, like Germany, and we will improve or exit unprofitable products and markets.
In addition, we're also targeting a significant reduction in personnel and structural costs.
You are going to hear more about specifics this year after the consultation process is completed.
Assuming a steady macroeconomic for our business units around the world, we believe all the actions I've just shared with you will drive favorable mix this year with a fairly flat cost structure, as investments in our all-new utility products across the globe are offset by our specific cost actions.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
At this time, if you would like to ask a question, simply press ""*1"" on your telephone keypad.
Again, that is ""*1"" on your telephone keypad.
Your first question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.
"
3220,F,2018,4,james-d.-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,1,"Sure.
So, we certainly have line of sight for improvement and a narrowing of our losses this year.
And as we localize several key models this year and next year and in the coming years, we see a great line of sight for very solid profitable business in China.
This year, to give you a flavor, we have those more than 10 new products.
Our dealer network, as you mentioned, has stabilized now and is starting to grow in terms of profitability and engagement.
And a lot of those products are coming in the second half of the year.
I mentioned localization.
Those are really key.
We have Explorer, three new Lincolns in three years.
So, the localizations really drive our profitability in the next few years.
Anning and the team have already started on a very serious effort on material costs as well as structural costs as well.
We expect that to take hold in the second half of this year and next year.
"
3221,F,2018,4,james-d.-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,2,"Yeah.
It's a great question.
So, relatively speaking, the F Series is a carryover vehicle but it's still relatively new.
One of the big drivers was the impact of Super Duty in North America.
It was really an important positive.
And I would say as well the team is really laser-focused on yield management.
We got a lot of really positive news on the controllables for series mix, product mix, through different allocations, different go-to-market strategies, and those are being worked in these vehicle line rooms that we're not institutionalizing.
But I would say a lot of it was truck because that was still relatively new and is still.
And a lot of it was controllable by the team.
"
3222,F,2018,4,james-d.-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,3,"Rod, it's Jim.
I want to help shape this question and tee this up for Bob because no doubt you heard me talk about the structural costs for five years kept accelerating.
And we arrested that.
That didn't take us long.
And we've actually turned it now to the second year.
The structural improvements that we're making in the white collar area, the way I've described the car architecture and what that's going to do to product development is coupled with the inference that you make about, once you get Europe restructured, yeah, you start to see a big improvement.
And, Bob, I know there's more to that that we're doing in addition to the things I just mentioned but I want you to see that we are counting that as we talk to you.
The frustration that I feel is felt is why does it take long to get that done and through the system.
And I respect that.
But it is what it takes to build an industrial model that we're talking about.
To do it the right way and not have it fall apart, not to have big disruptions and so on.
"
3223,F,2018,4,james-d.-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,4,"And Adam?
"
3224,F,2018,4,james-d.-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,5,"I just want to add because we had this conversation when we first met, when you were thinking out loud with me.
When you're facing this buffet of issues that you have to deal with and you're thinking about the cash question, I want you to think out loud with me how we've tried to hedge some of that in some of these alliance structures, in that it gives us paths to new product ideas that we can share our costs.
And, of course, in the MOU and AV opportunity, we can share costs in there.
And none of those have really flowed through the planning yet because they aren't all secured yet.
But those are highly likely things that will improve, hedging what you might see as a risk there.

That concludes the Q&A.
I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Hackett for closing remarks.

Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO, Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer, and Jim Farley, President of Global Markets.
Also joining us today are Marcy Klevorn, President of Mobility, Joe Hinrichs, President of Global Operations, and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework.
Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then Jim Farley will talk about the actions we're taking to improve our performance in China and Europe.
After Jim's comments, we'll open the call up for questions.
Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S.
GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found, along with the rest of our earnings materials, at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussions include forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance.
Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 47.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year; company EBIT, EPS, and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis; and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis.
Now, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.
"
3227,F,2018,4,lynn-antipas-tyson,executive-director-of-investor-relations,False,1,
3228,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Jim, and good evening, everyone.
Before going through the details, I'd like to provide some context on the quarter and the year.
And to keep it simple, I'll just focus on the full year although my comments generally apply to both periods.
First off, let me reiterate what Jim said about our market factors.
In a year of no global growth in industry volume and of relatively light new product action at Ford, we delivered very strong market factors, specifically strong mix and higher net pricing.
We delivered 45% of this in the fourth quarter alone.
It's probably fair to say that most folks didn't expect this from Ford given our product refresh plan for the year.
And you should note that in 2019, we have planned a more active year of significant product actions in growing segments.
Secondly, in 2018, we incurred headwinds of about $3.3 billion in four areas.
These impacts are not indicative, for the most part, of the ongoing run rate of the business.
The first, roughly $750 million in tariff-related effects.
The second, $1.1 billion of increased commodity costs unrelated to tariff effects.
The third, about $750 million of unfavorable exchange, net of pricing, were taken to partially recover some of this impact.
And fourth, about $775 million related to the Takata recalls announced last year in North America.
Now, of this $3 billion impact, we incurred a bit more than $1.9 billion in North America.
North America's EBIT, however, declined year-over-year by only $450 million.
This suggests to us that Kumar Galhotra and his team delivered strong improvements elsewhere in the business as they continue their aggressive work to return the region to a 10% margin.
South America absorbed about $400 million of these headwinds, yet it delivered a $75 million EBIT improvement from 2017.
Again, this demonstrates to us that the efforts of Lyle Watters and his team to successfully push back against these adverse trends, not to mention other inflationary effects not counted in the $400 million, as they approached a fundamental redesign of the business in the region.
The two regions that essentially drove the year-over-year decline in Automotive and company EBIT, both for the full year and in the fourth quarter, were Asia Pacific -- specifically, China -- and Europe.
Asia Pacific took on about $400 million of the company headwinds yet delivered a much deeper decline in results from 2017.
$1.8 billion, in fact.
And Europe absorbed about $600 million of the headwinds yet saw a year-over-year decline of $765 million and that was with the strongest product refresh among all our regions in 2018.
These results underscore the urgency we have in addressing Ford-specific performance issues and executing fundamental redesigns of our business models in these regions to generate appropriate returns on future capital that we may allocate to them.
Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight, both for the full year and the quarter, the continued strong and stable results from Ford Credit.
So, with that, let's turn to Slide 6, the summary of our company key metrics.
There's three things I want to highlight here.
First, in the quarter, all key metrics were lower from a year ago with the exception of revenue, which benefited from strong mix in North America and higher net pricing across all regions except China.
Performance in China and Europe drove the year-over-year decline in most of the other metrics.
Second, company adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.30 per share and this includes an adjusted effective tax rate of negative 4% driven by the favorable impact of U.S.
tax planning and tax reform.
Finally, company GAAP net income was a negative $116 million.
This includes adverse special items of $1.2 billion.
Two major items drove this.
First, we incurred a negative, non-cash pre-tax mark-to-market adjustment for our pension and OPEB plans that totaled $877 million.
This was due to adverse financial market conditions that occurred late in the year.
The second was personnel separation charges of $262 million.
Now, turning to Slide 8, favorable results in Automotive and Ford Credit more than accounted for the company adjusted EBIT of $1.5 billion.
This result was nearly $600 million lower than the year-ago period, explained mainly by a lower Automotive EBIT.
In Mobility, we incurred a loss, as planned, driven by investments to develop our mobility services and autonomous technology businesses.
Next, looking at taxes, while total company taxes were low in the quarter, this compares to a positive absolute total tax effect a year ago, resulting in a large unfavorable increase in the impact of taxes.
This largely reflects the non-repeat of favorable U.S.
tax reform and tax planning effects a year ago.
Slide 9 shows that North America generated $2 billion of the $1.1 billion Automotive EBIT.
Operations outside North America were individually and collectively at a loss, which increased from a year ago.
China and Europe drove the increase in the combined loss outside of North America.
Slide 10 highlights Ford Credit.
In the quarter, Ford Credit delivered earnings before taxes of $663 million, up 9%.
The full-year EBT of $2.6 billion was the best in eight years.
Ford Credit continues to operate very well and support Automotive effectively.
U.S.
consumer metrics remain healthy.
As shown on Slide 11, we ended the year achieving positive company adjusted operating cash flow in the quarter and the full year.
We also ended the year with a cash balance of about $23 billion with liquidity at more than $34 billion, both above our targets.
Cash net of debt was $8.9 billion.
Our global funded pension plans at year-end continue to be fully funded, taken together, and de-risked.
Turning to the full year for a moment, Slide 12 shows that Automotive and Ford Credit results more than accounted for company adjusted EBIT of $7 billion.
Mobility and Corporate Other, as expected, were losses.
Compared to a year ago, the lower Automotive EBIT fully explains the decline in company EBIT.
Bridging to our GAAP net income results, special items for the full year were driven by the fourth quarter pension and OPEB remeasurement adjustment and personnel separation across North and South America and Europe.
Slide 13 focuses on the regional results of our full-year Automotive EBIT.
Like the fourth quarter, North America more than explained the profitability, while we incurred losses outside of North America.
Compared to the prior year, and like the fourth quarter, the decline in Automotive EBIT was essentially due to China and Europe.
Unlike in the fourth quarter, North America was down in the full year as well due to the headwinds that I mentioned earlier.
Turning to our outlook for 2019, as shown on Slide 14, we see the potential for year-over-year improvement in key company metrics, including revenue, EBIT margin, ROIC, cash conversion, and adjusted debt to EBITDA.
This is based on what we control and the specific assumptions we've made for key external factors, as we shared last week in Detroit at the Deutsche Bank Conference.
From a business unit perspective, we expect North America, China, and Europe, where results were lower in 2018, to lead the potential EBIT improvement.
Drivers of this would be the favorable effects of new products, fitness initiatives as they gain greater traction, and a turnaround, at least in part, of the major factors that led to our lower China performance in 2018.
Offsetting these positive effects, in part, will be higher investments in Mobility, both for our autonomous vehicle business and mobility services development, as well as lower, but still strong, earnings before taxes at Ford Credit.
This reflects lower volume and margin and higher operating costs.
Now, before going to Q&A, Jim Farley is going to provide his insights on the actions that we're taking in China and Europe to improve our near-term performance in both regions.
Jim?
"
3229,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Hey, David.
It's Bob.
Another way of thinking about it that will help you, I think, with what you're trying to get at is that our EBIT charges that we've talked about, $11 billion, effectively, they're almost nearly spent by the time we get to the end of 2020.
And when you think about the cash effects of $7 billion done largely by the time we get to the end of '21 because there's a little bit of a lag, as there often is, between the recognition of the charge and the cash going out the door.
So, you can read from that that we've accelerated the plans from what we shared with you earlier in the year.
"
3230,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yeah.
I mean, it was volume.
We also had negative net pricing.
That's been a feature in China for quite a number of years but it was pretty simple and straightforward.
And the team actually delivered some cost improvements but not nearly enough to offset what we saw in volume.
The volume was largely, I call it, us, although as we all saw in the fourth quarter, in particular, the industry really fell off very, very sharply.
And Jim can maybe add to that.
"
3231,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah, that's getting a lot of attention, obviously.
And I won't pretend to speak on behalf of the rating agencies but my interpretation of their concerns is that it's really the operating performance.
The balance sheet, as you noted, John, is very strong.
And we deliberately are running the cash and the liquidity at levels that are above our targets, in part because we saw this period of lower cash generation on the horizon and so we've been planning for that.
But at the end of the day, what we as a team have to do is we've got to deliver stronger operating performance.
And that operating performance includes stronger cash flow.
As we've mentioned both at Deutsche Bank and today, we certainly see the opportunity for us to deliver on our plan this year and that includes stronger cash generation.
But, again, it's an interesting -- it's not so binary.
As I mentioned to someone the other day, if we didn't pay the dividend, we've got $25 billion of cash.
It's really a question -- it's not that cash level.
It's the ability of the business to generate, as we look ahead, positive cash flow and we think that we're going to be able to do that to a degree that is above and beyond what we delivered in '18.
"
3232,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,4,"Yeah, the $700 million that I referred to was for the full year.
There was a big chunk of it that was in the fourth quarter but there was actually a couple of recalls.
There were some other costs associated with it that were spread through the year.
So, that was the full year.
All those numbers I gave you, Rod, were also year numbers.
But it's true that that alone, if you think about the revenue, it's maybe seven-tenths of a point of full-year margin in the case of North America.
So, they would have been up in the mid-8s.
"
3233,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Yeah.
Just a chunk of that was Takata.
"
3234,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,6,"Yeah.
So, if you think about 2019, clearly, we've got a lot that's going to be going on on the top line, including mix, pricing, all the product stuff, building on very strong performance in that part of the business in 2018, actually.
So, that would be something that you should expect to see from us in 2019.
Coming with that will be some degree of net product cost investment.
That's always the case with new products.
But we do have, in the year, a continued improvement in the level of -- I forgot the words that we use -- the fitness initiatives.
We said when we first started talking about it, that that would gain traction a little bit in '18, it would start to grow in '19.
That certainly is the case.
That is included in our assumptions and that continues to progress as we go forward.
Because a good portion of that was related to material costs that we believe that we'll realize as we go into new models.
So, that certainly is something that you'll see featured as we go forward.
But I think your overall premise about their being -- put aside external things that could come against us, yeah, we should be accelerating as we come out of 2019 because we will have gone through a big step forward in Europe.
There will be other parts of the business that we will have been taking actions on.
There will be more that comes in 2020.
Going back to the comment I made earlier around the acceleration of the redesign and the restructuring affecting some of our key regions, all of that should bear fruit.
And then, very importantly, the improvement in China because we had a very large loss in 2018.
We expect that to reduce in 2019 and we're moving very aggressively to get it back into a profit.
So, that will really, really help.
And don't forget the localization of some key imports into China, which the effect of that is pretty amazing when you look at each of the Lincoln products and the Explorer, in terms of going from what now are quite substantial losses for those imports to very attractive, locally built business cases.
So, it'll be a number of different things, Rod, but your overall premise of the business gaining traction, whether it's restructuring, redesign, fitness initiatives, localization, fixing things, like in the case of China, all that starts to gain momentum as we move forward.
"
3235,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,7,"I don't usually get to answer my questions to a beat.
"
3236,F,2018,4,robert-l.-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,8,"I'm looking for the silver disco ball.
On a serious note, Adam, I think I was very clear at Deutsche Bank in terms of our overall financial strategy.
It starts with a strong balance sheet, an investment grade rating, maintaining our debt capacity, and ensuring that our global funded pension plan stays funded and de-risked.
So, to me, that is sort of ground zero.
And then what you have to do, and it kind of goes back to the earlier question that I think Dave asked, which is then the business has got to generate the cash flow that enables us to fund everything else.
Everything else includes the traditional business, the new business opportunities.
It includes, obviously, the shareholder distributions.
So, I think that's the foundation and that's certainly how we're looking at the business and running the business.
The dilemma that we're facing is the rating agencies are concerned about the operating performance of the business and the trend that we've been on.
We've had a lot of discussions with them about that and the plans that we have in place to address that.
At least my interpretation, again, from chatting with them is it's not a concern around the balance sheet, per se.
In fact, just the opposite.
They make the same comments that I think some of you have made around the strength of the balance sheet.
It's really around this operating performance.
So, again, repeating what I said in Detroit, based on our view of what we expect the year to be, we would expect to generate a stronger level of cash flow.
We expect to be able to fund all of our business needs, including the regular dividend, but we have to prove that.
Just having more cash isn't gonna help.
We already have more than we're targeting.
We have to demonstrate business is turning on an operating performance level, including cash generation.

3238,F,2018,4,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,0,"Hi.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Firstly, following your autonomous vehicle demonstration in Miami during the quarter, I'm curious where you think you are in terms of your autonomous capabilities, both in relation to your 2021 targeted commercial rollout and relative to key competitors such as Waymo or Cruise.
Do you think you are No.
1, No.
2, No.
3 in autonomous, etc.? And then, Jim, following on your comment in Detroit last week that you are open to investors in this area and have lots of interest, I thought to ask what you would look for in a partner, as it sounds like you might have some options.
"
3239,F,2018,4,ryan-brinkman,j.p.-morgan,True,1,
3240,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer-",False,0,"Thank you, Lynn, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
If you would turn to Slide 2, as we recap 2018 and look ahead to 2019, I would like to make a couple of points to start our discussion this evening.
For Ford, 2018 will be known as the year between the business that wasn't designed right and the business that we know will win.
Certainly, it was a challenging year, in that we were hit by some headwinds outside of our control and, frankly, poor performance in some parts of the business which we have now taken action to address.
Importantly, 2018 was a year of progress where we laid the foundation for a much stronger, more resilient, and more dynamic business.
A business that we want to tell you can thrive now and in the future.
So, I am really optimistic as we enter 2019.
We have a clear vision, we have a solid plan, and we are in execution mode.
We're fortifying and building on our strengths to start and taking decisive action to address underperforming parts of the business, some that you know about.
For example, our decision last April to phase out sedans in the U.S.
and a restructuring in Europe that we announced recently.
And Jim Farley will touch on this later, along with the action we are taking in China to restore profitable growth.
We are reorganizing and resizing our global salaried workforce and we're retooling product development to bring more unique customer-focused product to market more efficiently.
We're leveraging relationship where it makes sense to be more cost- and capital-efficient, hence our alliances with VW and Mahindra.
Our work on AVs and mobility is advancing quickly.
We're connecting every new Ford vehicle in the U.S.
to the cloud.
And soon these vehicles will talk to the world around them through the technology known as C-V2X.
Through this, we will help usher in a new transportation system that reduces traffic congestion, accidents, and improves CO2.
Now let's turn to Slide 3.
I will cover our full financial metrics here.
For the year, revenue grew 2%, we generated $7 billion in EBIT with a margin of 4.4%, and we delivered $1.30 in EPS.
Led by North America, Auto EBIT benefited from the largest improvement in market factors in seven years.
This benefit was more than offset by commodity and currency headwinds and higher net product costs as we entered a major product refresh cycle.
We also incurred higher warranty costs and the Ford-specific challenges in China and Europe -- again, confirming that we are addressing all of those.
Importantly, in the face of all that, we generated $2.8 billion in company cash flow and we ended the year with $23.1 billion in cash and $34.2 billion in liquidity, both well above our targets.
I'd ask you to turn to Slide 4.
This is the strategic highlight slide.
Now, in every market, this team is focused on introducing a fresher, more targeted and appealing lineup that can compete and win in the marketplace.
For example, in the U.S., over the next 24 months we are refreshing 75% of the lineup.
In that, we're bolstering our strong pickup and commercial vehicle business, now a $72 billion global franchise with 14% EBIT margin.
In 2018, our F Series outsold the nearest competitor by the widest margin ever and our transaction prices were about $2,000.00 about segment average.
In the U.S., we recently started selling the new Ranger and early customer interest has been very strong.
In Europe, we are expanding our profitable transit commercial vehicle franchise that includes new services and revenue streams in that strategy.
Given our brand strength and capability, we have the opportunity to create a similar stronghold in SUVs globally and we are moving quickly in this area.
The new Explorer we revealed last week in Detroit at the Auto Show is but one in a series of world-class SUVs that we're bringing to market.
The Lincoln Aviator is another example.
And I have to say, we've been really pleased to see the experts note how superior the Aviator is to other brands that it competes against.
We also launched the all-new Focus and Escort in China and this is the first of many new products for China.
Jim will hit on this area as well.
In terms of advancing our propulsion strategy, we introduced the new Explorer Hybrid, the first of our next generation of advanced hybrids that provide a no compromise blend of capability and efficiency.
We will reveal a new fully electric utility later this year with, if I say so myself, stunning design, performance, and technology.
And we've confirmed that we have started early work on a zero emissions version of the F150.
In November, shifting to the press review of self-driving technology, we demonstrated how that technology will propel self-driving fleets and partnerships with cities and businesses to deliver people and goods in new ways with new business models.
I was very happy with the reviews that that generated.
As we build out our mobility business, note that we acquired the e-scooter company Spin and this has delivered first-mile and last-mile mobility solutions.
Lastly, the bottom line impacts of our fitness initiatives on operating leverage will continue in 2019.
I get asked about this all the time.
Let me tell you that from 2013 through 2017, our Automotive structural costs increased by $1.7 billion per year on average.
We've arrested this trend in 2018.
We kept costs flat year-over-year and we expect our structural costs to be flat again in 2019.
Before I turn it over to Bob, let me say, in the coming months that, of course, you can expect us to share more specific initiatives related to the redesign of our global business.
There's nothing more important than having you understand what's happening there.
I want to confirm that plans are in place and that we're taking action.
These announcements, though, have to come in a coordinated way as we work respectfully and constructively with our stakeholders.
Now, let me turn it over to Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer.
Bob?
"
3241,F,2018,4,marcy-klevorn,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-mobility,False,0,"Sure.
Thank you for the question.
First of all, to answer kind of the first part of your question about how we're feeling overall, our message has not changed and our confidence level remains the same, which is we are on track to have a purpose-built vehicle at scale by 2021.
And we, I think maybe somewhat uniquely, have said all along this is a very difficult problem and we'll be ready in 2021.
And we are also uniquely building the technology along with building a business.
And as Jim referenced, the Miami experience, we demonstrated how we are building the tech and the business side by side.
It's very important so when these vehicles become available, we have already figured out how we want to monetize them and establish key partnerships, like Walmart, who we announced in November, and already partnering with Postmates, Dominos, and others.
And as far as the partnership, building on Jim's comment, we believe, and I know many in the industry do as well, that there will probably be maybe two, three-ish kind of winners left standing at the end of all this.
We're confident we'll be one of those.
We will pick partners that help build that dominance.
So, building scale, continuing to learn how to build businesses, etc., will be something that we would look for in selecting a partner.

And your last question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

3243,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,0,"Unquestionably, David.
And it's worth pointing this out that the time, I'm gonna say, in 2017, when we had our first investor conference, to the beginning of 2018, we worked on this strategy.
We addressed the product portfolio from stem to stern.
You just heard from Jim how important that was.
We were constipated in product development.
And when we did that, we updated the way we thought about car architectures and propulsion.
So, we addressed three big issues all at the same time, got our cycle plan in shape, and taking cost out, to boot.
The second thing we did is we -- I was really pleased with the AV work with Argo.
They really started at the same time in June 2017.
So, they've only been in real action in 20 months.
So, in that time that we were planning, we put a lot of work toward thinking about the evolution of AV.
I can just share that, independently, lots of people looking at this business, and looking at all the competitors, have rated Argo very high.
It's not surprising given the talent that we've got there.
Then we started to tackle Mobility.
And you've heard me talk about, David, the idea of building a cloud structure and connectivity.
We had none of the vehicles really connected back when the call to action was being asked for.
So, we had to get that through product development and now the plan to monetize that.
All those things are in shape.
And then as I tour with you, if you look at North America, it's exemplary for me the way the management team, gathering to work and make all this stuff happen with Kumar has really gone very well.
They ran into some headwinds that they, frankly, offset a lot of and then some they couldn't.
and then we had a foot fault with warranty this year that Joe can explain in more detail if that helps everyone understand that we've arrested, we think, a lot of the issues.
And some of them were costs from the past that you just have to deal with.
When I think about then, in October of '17, the call from very smart people following the industry saying, ""Hey, what are you gonna do about these markets that are underperforming?"" Every one of them are being addressed.
I also just want to confirm, in China, that I'm not happy with the way we performed there but the lesson is also showing the market moved on everybody and it's changed.
So, we've just got to be world-class at dealing with that and you heard from Jim tonight and we can talk more about that -- what's going on in China.
So, that's my quick tour for you that, from that thinking phase to the doing phase, all those things I just said -- just from top of mind, I'm not reading from a list -- we're all over that.
"
3244,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,1,"Yeah.
So, let's cover that.
So, on the white-collar work, hard to explain, but going very well, is an attempt -- I think it's a modern attempt, I said this at Deutsche Bank -- to involve the leadership in architecting a new version of Ford that doesn't have as many levels and layers, less bureaucratic, more team-oriented.
We believe we'll have that work behind us by April of this year.
We started that last October.
So, it would have taken us nine months.
The Europe redesign is a little longer and we're gonna start seeing benefits later this year.
You know, any of you that follow industrial companies, paybacks in those parts of the world, because of strong social plans, are 4-5 years, on average.
But there's gonna be some quick wins.
And I think the confidence -- I can just cite this -- in our management team, we have a plan that's starting to come together.
I'm very, very excited about that turning out very well.
There's more news coming on South America.
It's not a lack of planning or consideration.
It's managing the constituencies and all the different interests.
But you don't have to wait long on that, David, so you'll know more about the year there.
The Russian Alliance is under review.
When I sat in the boardroom, that was done and we just did it again and want to come back with, given all these markets that Jim Farley has led the review of, we'll be done with that.
And you'll expect-then, as you are looking at our forecast, going forward, it'll be cleaner.
A lot of this will be behind us.
"
3245,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,2,"Is that your background, Adam?
"
3246,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,3,"Yeah, I feel like Adam didn't get to ask all his questions.
I apologize, Adam.
And we don't know what the noise is so, again, thank you for your tolerance of that.
It's not coming from here.
But I'd like to just say I think I feel good that we got most of our comments out.
'18 was a year of progress, in terms of laying the foundation for the global redesign of our business.
It was all about sharpening the competitiveness so we can better satisfy our customers while investing in the future.
We aren't mortgaging that.
This is my second point.
Ford enters 2019 with a very clear vision and we're building momentum to improve profitability and returns.
We're now in execution mode.
Third, we're taking decisive action in all underperforming parts of the business and we're allocating capital to higher return opportunities, as you note what we did with the sedan issues this past year.
In the coming months, you can expect us to share much more about specific initiatives in some of these areas that we're restructuring.
Finally, the work we're doing today to create this healthy, vibrant Ford for the benefit of all our stakeholders, as I said earlier, is gonna allow us to invest in a future that will be even more rewarding, in our mind, for investors.
We think this is a good time to invest in Ford.
Our vision is to become the world's most trusted company, designing smart vehicles for a smart world.
In doing so, we have the opportunity to participate -- this is an exciting thing -- in a new, huge addressable market.
Because of that, it helps create a better transportation, a better world that will improve lives.
Thank you all for joining us tonight.

3248,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,5,"I'm gonna ask Bob and Jim to tag team on that.
Bob?
"
3249,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,6,"I would like to look at the riddle.
There's a lot of variables in that consideration.
And legacy costs would be one, David, but it's not the only thing that we've thought about.
Operator
And your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
"
3250,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,7,"I'm gonna ask Jim to address that.
"
3251,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,8,"I'm gonna riff with you on this, Bob, because David Tamberrino's question and John's question are linked here.
Because when Bob points the simple approach to saying you've got to improve the operating performance to build confidence, David, your question about all those things that we were doing is totally intended to do that.
And that's why the team started with we've got to get new product in the system.
The new product, as has been observed, can do better.
But we had to fund all the development of that.
That's in some of our higher costs.
But we're happy that a lot of this is through the system and the new stuff is going to be coming.
So, it's the intersection of all that hard work giving us the chance now to win, with all of these things in front of us coordinated and happening now.
So, that's why I would give us higher probability of improving operating performance because of the mix and the kinds of things that we're bringing to bear here.
"
3252,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,9,"I get to look backwards, right? With hindsight just like I feel I have to be studied that way.
When I look in hindsight, I wouldn't have traded some of the product deferrals that happened that caused some of the delays that we now are riding.
So, as I go forward, I have to look in the mirror and say I'm gonna be faced with moments of truth.
I'm not gonna starve product.
So, I want to confirm what you said.
But I think the challenges of competing in China and the challenges of competing in Europe, the challenges of competing in South America, are also about design of business issues that we've addressed.
They have to do with the underlying car architectures, how complex the organizations can get, how big they can get.
We don't have the F Series profitability in all of those markets.
And, in a way, that might have misled us about some of the potential.
So, it's the combination of product and what I would say is model design that we've addressed.
Operator
And your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
"
3253,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,10,"Rod, I get to tell them that your real name's Rod Lache every time.
You know that.
"
3254,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,11,"And let me sneak in that something like a simple metric, where we don't want to spend beyond our depreciation rates today in capital, so we've got to wash through some things that were already in the system.
But we're designing the business so that its capital appetite drops in the future.
Operator
And your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with J.P.
Morgan.
"
3255,F,2018,4,james-p.-hackett,"president,-director,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,12,"Yeah.
And I mentioned in my comments that I'm very proud of, because of the interest in investors, how Argo has been graded.
So, it's a strong, strong enterprise.
You all saw that when you went down to Miami.
And Marcy has worked really hard at this question of what kind of partners make sense.
How do we get one plus one equals three? I want to remark that you know last week that we told you that we signed an MOU to have discussions with VW.
I have nothing to report tonight but, Marcy, what else would you add to this effort?
"
3256,F,2018,3,colin-langan,ubs,True,0,"Oh, great.
Actually just a follow-up on that.
I mean there's also questions about your credit rating.
How important is it to maintain investment grade in your view, because I imagine the dividends and all those cash restructuring (inaudible) that aren't getting downgraded.
How critical is that?
"
3257,F,2018,3,colin-langan,ubs,True,1,"Got it.
And just a follow up on the question on the 2020 target.
Why not just push the targets out, I mean, because there's no -- unless I misread it there's no new target date.
Any color on why this does not (inaudible) put it back to where it original was?
"
3258,F,2018,3,colin-langan,ubs,True,2,"Got it.
And then lastly on China.
Any sense of when that stabilizes and any idea when it gets back to a profit? I mean, how should we think about inflection? Thanks.
"
3259,F,2018,3,colin-langan,ubs,True,3,"Want to talk about industry sales.
"
3260,F,2018,3,colin-langan,ubs,True,4,"Got it.
All right.
Thank you very much.
"
3261,F,2018,3,colin-langan,ubs,True,5,
3262,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,0,"Good evening, guys.
Jim just, in your comments, and the way you're discussing everything, all the actions you're taking at the Company, it kind of feels like the restructuring actions that you're talking about $11 billion non-cash, $7 billion cash, will be over a multi-year period, and maybe more of a rolling process as opposed to what some of us in the industry are used to as sort of a big bang outline of a plan and massive charges upfront.
Is that possibly a correct characterization, and we're going to learn about this along the way, because $7 billion or $11 billion over a three to five-year period in the auto industry can get washed out in total to some degree.
Just trying to understand, how you're thinking about this, if this is more of an ongoing rolling program as opposed to a big bang one.
"
3263,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,1,"And just to be clear the time frame is around five years in sort of what you're thinking here as far as what you know right now, is that about right?
"
3264,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,2,"Okay.
And then just a follow-up on this.
I mean, we are two years away from where you were talking about hitting 8% EBIT, and high-teens return on invested capital.
Obviously market dynamics have changed dramatically more recently, so understandable.
But just curious what kind of market dynamics you need to hit those numbers? I mean, are we looking at sort of -- is it sort of a mid-cycle thought process? I mean, just really trying to understand what you're thinking about there because it is a big change.
"
3265,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,3,"Those targets are still there?
"
3266,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,4,"And then just one last quick one on market dynamics.
Net price in North America, negative 3.18 (ph).
So a little bit surprising to the downside.
Obviously mix as a huge more than positive offset.
Just curious what you're seeing in the dynamics in the North American market because some of the data we're getting externally is kind of positive and negative and it's a little bit unclear to understand exactly what's going on there.
"
3267,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,5,"Jim that's the Escape and the Explorer next year, is that correct?
"
3268,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,6,"Great.
Thank you very much.
"
3269,F,2018,3,john-murphy,bank-of-america,True,7,
3270,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,0,"Certainly in the utility and car markets, we're seeing more pressure because of availability.
But it's really encouraging to see Ford's performance in full-size truck.
Our transaction price is up more than market.
Our share is up.
It's never been a more competitive segment.
Ford's lead continues to grow.
And we've had meaningful product investment, new diesel Raptors being well received, new powertrains.
So that all helped.
I think the opportunity for us is as we refresh those utilities next year, we really accelerate our opportunity for pricing and mix.
These are high-volume products for us with enormous car parks.
And we're going off -- older vehicles to brand new vehicles I think will have the freshest utility lineup in the US here pretty soon.
So as far as a background market, I think it's -- we're really in a bit of a different situation given the freshness of our products.
So, great opportunity for us.
"
3271,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,1,"Among others, we actually have more thinking.
We have -- we have quite a few and of course we have 13 million pickup truck owners in the US and we're just about to launch a great new Ranger, which is a brand new nameplate.
So, it's not just utilities, it is also pickup.
"
3272,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,2,"Sure.
First of all, this is such an important and urgent work by the team.
The good news is we've addressed the error states we had, which is great.
The stocks are down to 45 days, dealers are profitable again and our sell down units for these new products, the three that Bob mentioned were in fantastic shape.
So I think, we are in really good foundation for the launch of these new products that come basically, as Bob said, in the first quarter.
And these are high volume products for us.
Anning is a very experienced operations reader.
And we feel that the accelerated costs -- addressing the cost in the business is really essential for our profit turnaround in China.
He has deep experience in purchasing, engineering and these are going to be keys to our turnaround in China for profit.
The other one is profit line management, which has really yielded so much benefits here in North America.
With these new launches, a launch mix and rates, series, feature content, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive better margins in China.
So as far as the Ford team is concerned, this is all hands on deck as Jim mentioned and we are working urgently and as a team as you can imagine.
"
3273,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,3,"Yeah, industry as you know in the third quarter was down about 10% in China.
To be honest, that's a bit expected because the previous two years there was a purchase incentive boost to the industry, which was eliminated this year.
We saw a pretty big hangover in the first quarter.
Industry demand came back, but it has not really recovered to last year's level in the third quarter.
As Bob said, there's a lot of speculation about incentives or not.
Look our turnaround in China is really up to us.
It's about our new products and our cost performance.
But we definitely see a weaker market there.
Some of it is external, some of it it internal, like the purchase tax I mentioned, but for us the opportunity is within our control.
"
3274,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,4,"Thank you, Colin.
Operator
And our next question is from line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.
"
3275,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,5,"Okay.
Well, WLTP has been a really large effect in Europe.
As you know, it's had a pretty big industry effect.
The great news is that Ford planned this very thoughtfully.
We had no capacity issues, very little in our transition to 6.2.
We are already through that transition.
So Joe's team did a fantastic job and we don't really see any hiccups in our business due to that.
But I know it -- obviously it has a big impact on the industry as a whole.
We've seen -- we're kind of entering the second month of a hangover for the sell down of 6.1.
But we're through that now as a team.
As far as Europe is concerned, Bob mentioned that we have such a gem in our LCD business, continues to get stronger actually for us.
Our share goes up.
Even if the UK, our leading market is down, we continue to make more progress.
The opportunity for us in Europe is twofold for our profit turnaround.
The first is cost in every part of our business and the team is really continues to accelerate that work and we're working with all of our stakeholders on that.
The other one is addressing our mix deficit on our passenger cars.
We just have been under representing the utilities, as Jim said globally, but especially in Europe.
But that all changes as we launch a new generation of utilities in Europe and even add name plates next year and beyond.
So I think the mix effect in cost will be key.
"
3276,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,6,"We believe as the utility business in the US becomes a lot more competitive, given all the nameplates have been launched.
Bob said, we really feel like there's two big bets for Ford.
The first is differentiation where we're going to expand the number of nameplates into more differentiated like authentic off-roaders or really fantastic on-road urban crossovers, but the other one is to address our total cost of ownership.
We feel that from models, like Escape, for them to continue to be great profit opportunities for the Company the residual value, the fuel economy performance of the vehicle, these are critical metrics for this leadership team.
And as Bob said, we are actually taking some short-term share decisions on Escape to protect the transition to the new vehicle, as well as protect our residual value to minimize our variable marketing spend.
And that's another reason why we've had this mix effect.
"
3277,F,2018,3,james-d.-farley,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-markets",False,7,
3278,F,2018,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-operations",False,0,"Yeah, the way I would describe it is we're at the peak of our capital and we've acknowledged that in our previous discussions.
We're going to see the benefits over the next several years as the new product programs that we're launching today get the full benefit of the architecture and module work.
So you're accurate in saying and thinking that we'll get more benefit as the years progress, but we are starting to see engineering savings in the near term.
On a capital basis, the capital reuse work we're doing with the module architecture work combined will save us significant amount of capital over the next several years.
"
3279,F,2018,3,joseph-r.-hinrichs,"executive-vice-president-and-president,-global-operations",False,1,"(inaudible) we're timing it to the introduction of the new products.

Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2018 earnings call.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer.
Also joining us are Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets; Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President of Global Operations; and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework we unveiled earlier this year which we now call creating tomorrow together.
Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then we'll open the call for questions.
Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussions include forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance.
Actual results may differ from those stated.
And the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 35.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.
Company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis.
Now let me to turn the call over to Jim.

3283,F,2018,3,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,0,"Hi, great.
Thanks for taking my question.
Thanks for the earlier color in China too.
But I wanted to ask on Lincoln in China, specifically and on branding more generally.
Relative to these tariffs that you're having to pay 40% now, where are you in terms of the localization of Lincoln in China? Can that all be accelerated? And then the more general branding question is, previously, I think it was seem at Lincoln would benefit in China from being associated with like the Limousines used historically by the American presidents et cetera, by its American branding.
Just curious how you think American car brands are being perceived in China currently with some of the headlines this year.
I see Chevrolet and Cadillac seem to be doing all right.
So maybe there hasn't been too much change.
But just wanted to check in to see if you're detecting anything at the margin.
"
3284,F,2018,3,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,1,"Okay, that's good to hear.
Then I thought to ask too on Europe and WLTP, what has been the impact to your business there? How are you positioned relative to the other automakers in regards to that transition? And then just more generally in Europe, on the last call you talked about how -- maybe there hadn't been as much of a profit improvement from some of the recent launches over there.
Just wanted to follow up to see if that was still the case and what your current plan might be to improve the profit in Europe short of the better contribution margin from new models, et cetera.
"
3285,F,2018,3,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,2,"Okay.
And then just very lastly on mix in North America.
It looks like there are some very impressive gains there.
Can you elaborate on the drivers? I think I heard SUVs, anything else, speak to the sustainability of that? And I just wanted to check too, because the line item there is called mix/other.
What the other bit might entail and its sustainability?
"
3286,F,2018,3,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,3,"Very helpful.
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of David Tamberrino of Goldman Sachs.
"
3287,F,2018,3,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,4,
3288,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good afternoon to everyone.
I'd like to start my comments on slide 6, pointing out a few items from the Company key metrics.
So first, we reported mixed results on the top line with Company revenue higher than a year ago, driven by strong product mix in North America.
Wholesale volume on the other hand was down 10% and this was largely due to our joint ventures in China and Turkey.
Market share also was lower, this was driven by lower share in China although we had share declines across all regions.
And this reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of about 11%.
Finally, net income was $1 billion.
Now to put the quarter into context against recent performance, you can see on slide 7, that revenue was lower than in the past three quarters due mainly to lower volume.
Now some of this is seasonal reflecting the normal summer plant shutdowns that occur in Europe and North America.
Company EBIT and EBIT margin were essentially flat from the second quarter despite the lower volume and our positive Company operating cash flow was substantially higher than the second quarter and a year ago.
Now turning to slide 8, we see the absolute results for the Company across our reporting elements.
Company EBIT was driven by auto and Ford Credit results with losses as expected in mobility and Corporate Other.
The mobility loss was split about equally between investments and mobility services and our autonomous vehicle business.
The increased loss from the year ago, also was driven about equally by higher investments in both those areas of our mobility segment.
The Corporate Other loss consists of costs for corporate governance, mark-to-market adjustments on marketable securities and interest income.
The year-over-year increase in the loss was due to higher governance costs and unfavorable fair market valuation adjustments to our marketable securities.
The details of our automotive segment, which are shown on slide 9, highlight our performance in North America where we generated a healthy EBIT of $2 billion, which is higher than a year ago despite lower volume and higher commodity cost.
This was enabled by strongly positive mix as our portfolio continues to shift more to trucks, utilities and vans.
As a result, and as Jim mentioned, EBIT margin reached nearly 9%, which compares to an average first half margin of 7.6%.
While we continue to see a combined loss in our auto operations outside North America, the loss slightly improved from the second quarter despite lower volume.
This includes adjustments to dealer inventories in China that now have us positioned right where we want to be in terms of days supply.
In South America, the ongoing recovery in Brazil slowed due predominantly to external headwinds, including an 18% currency depreciation compared to a year ago and increasing inflation, including higher commodity prices.
In Argentina, the peso lost 45% of its value compared to a year ago and annual inflation is running at 34%.
Our team has responded with substantial price increases, resistance of inflation recovery by suppliers and continued reduction in structural costs.
We also continue to progress our plans to fundamentally transform our longer-term operating model in the region.
Turning to Europe, we saw favorable market factors from a year ago related to new products such as EcoSport, Fiesta and Transit Custom.
Our commercial business continued to be strong as well, delivering a record market share as Jim noted.
EBIT, however, deteriorated from a year ago, largely due to unfavorable external factors affecting performance in Turkey and Russia, combined with launch-related costs from the new Focus.
Our team is focused on accelerating actions to improve our near-term performance, while they continue to put in place the plans to substantially redesign our future business in Europe.
In Asia Pacific, the markets outside China, remained profitable, although lower than a year ago, generating a 9% EBIT margin.
As in the second quarter, the EBIT loss in Asia Pacific was driven by China, reflecting a loss for our consolidated China operations, as well as at our China joint ventures.
The losses were driven by the same factors as in the prior quarter, which is lower volume and lower net pricing.
Compared to the second quarter, however, we reduced the loss in China by over $100 million or about 20%.
We've made very good progress in addressing the underlying issues with more work to do.
We're focused intensely on our sales turnaround plan for China, and we're now just at the beginning of a strong product launch cadence, starting with the all-new Territory SUV, the all-new Focus, and the new Escort.
All of these models will make significant contributions to reinvigorating our sales growth in the first quarter next year.
We also expect to benefit as we move forward from the added focus of transitioning China to a stand-alone business unit within Ford, led by a strong Chinese leader with deep local knowledge and proven extensive operating experience.
We also intend to strengthen over time our position in emerging markets, enabled in part by the creation of a business unit, largely focused on how to win in these challenging and growing markets.
Let's turn now to slide 10, Ford Credit key metrics.
Ford Credit was an outstanding performer in the quarter, generating an EBT of $678 million, which was the best quarter in over seven years.
This was driven by favorable volume and mix and favorable lease residuals.
We saw our auction values rise 5% from prior year constant mix, and we now expect auction values for the full year to improve on average 3% at constant mix.
We're very encouraged that US consumer credit metrics remain healthy.
And in addition, Ford Credit's balance sheet remains strong with managed leverage remaining within the targeted range of 8 to 1 to 9 to 1.
The slide 11 reminds us of the strength and stability of Ford's balance sheet, featuring cash and liquidity levels in excess of our targets, and global funded pension plans that remain fully funded.
Finally, we are reaffirming our guidance for full year Company adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.50 per share.
So in addition to what Jim and I covered in the call, we have provided supplemental material in the earnings deck with more details and insights on the business.
So with that, what I'd like to do is to turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.
"
3289,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah, I just want to supplement what Jim said.
I think that's a perfect way of thinking about the way you expressed it John.
I am very thankful for the question.
When you think about the business, and even if you look at the quarter, we have a strong North America, can be and should be stronger, but it's now gaining momentum.
We have a strong commercial business in Europe, despite the loss that we had in the quarter.
We talked about big part of geography, in terms of the market outside of China and Asia Pacific at 9% margin.
I didn't talk about MENA, but there we had I think 7% or 8% margin.
Small market, but it's 1.3 billion consumers, and it is going to grow dramatically over the next 10 years.
And we're already starting to see the ability to be profitable there.
So it's the rest of the business, right.
And that business has got to be fundamentally redesigned.
The restructuring is an output of that or a result of it.
It's not a restructuring play.
It's a redesign play.
The result is the consequence of this restructuring and it will unfold.
There will be, I presume, spikes that'll be like a big thing that comes in this region at a certain point in time.
And then, maybe it's a bit quiet for a while, and something else big as we now get to that next chapter of what's going to be an unfolding story.
So I think that's a perfect way to think about it, which also I hope, I know it's frustrating, but I hope it helps investors understand why one can't sort of go to the last page of the book and look at the ending.
It's got to sort of unfold.
And that's -- and we'll share everything with you as we can as the things are announced.
"
3290,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yes, it's been for the year of several hundred million dollars.
I wouldn't be more specific than that.
"
3291,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,3,"Yeah, the only thing I would add and Joe can tell me if I'm wrong, that I think David conceptually some of these things were piloted with our C2 platform, which is the new platform that underpins the focus of the new Escape that comes in and so forth.
So a lot of it was piloted on that.
That's already starting to go into our plans.
So I think the learnings from that have just been further developed.
So unlike some competitors who had huge changeover costs associated with going to a different approach we don't see that happening inside Ford and in fact, as Joe mentioned, we expect to see efficiencies moving forward.
"
3292,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,4,"So I'm not providing anything other than saying that we are very comfortable with the range that we've provided and expect the business to come in within that range at the end of the year.
In terms of cash flow, I am not providing any guidance on cash flow other than for the full year which should still be consistent with the guidance we provided all throughout the year, which is positive, but down from last year.
"
3293,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Well, North America should, I mean that's one of the things that Kumar and the team are working on with their return to 10 initiatives.
I mean at this point in the cycle, it should, but if you think about the headwinds that Ford has around commodities, that's about $1.5 billion this year.
And the vast, vast majority of it sits in North America.
So that alone is worth quite a bit of margin, if you will.
So I think if anything, you've raised the point around some of the increases we've seen recently in warranty costs.
You think about that, you think about the commodities where we're investing and EVs, which of course has an impact and we're not selling them yet.
All those things and then to see North America starting to pick up pace in terms of its margin, it's 9% or near 9% in the quarter is very, very encouraging because they really should be operating at that type of 10%-plus level at this point in time.
They understand that, that's what they're working to achieve.
"
3294,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,6,
3295,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,7,"Well, I mean our business planning period is five years.
There will be a lot that is completed in five years.
But frankly, I think there will be some elements that go on a bit beyond that.
And let me just give you a good example.
We may have made recent investments in new products that a normal cycle would need to run for five years as long as those products are generating positive cash flow in sort of an incremental basis we will run them out.
So we're not going to short cycle them to get expense of being able to demonstrate how strong we are taking action we want to generate cash.
And so the consequences then of that rain out (ph) and not redeploying capital in that particular location or plant or segment could result then in something it takes place outside the period.
"
3296,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,8,"And -- this is the tough kind of leadership question, we have to keep our foot on the throat of our performance.
So we are doing that.
All of us are really happy actually about the momentum we're building as we adjust that target in that ironic.
But we think it's important as we get a better handle on our business, so we share with you that we need to change the time frame on that.
"
3297,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,9,"Yeah, I guess from a couple of standpoints.
Joe, one is -- and this has been our view for quite a long period of time, is that we do expect industry to decline over the next number of years.
I mean, still be strong absent a recession, but the decline in part due to affordability for all these increasing transaction prices and ultimately the effect of rising interest rates on monthly payments.
We also have not assumed that there is any material change in the level of commodity prices that we're seeing and that's hitting North America more than any other business units and that includes the bubble that we presently have in place.
That's a result of some of the policy decisions that have been made.
So that's not assumed to back off.
So all those could be opportunities if that weren't the case.
And then, of course, we do normal modeling, both variable and central cases around other scenarios that effective for (ph) each of our regions and as well as North America.
So yes, there's something else that you had in mind, but that is sort of the present thinking around those assumptions.
"
3298,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,10,"At current level.
"
3299,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,11,"The regular dividend.
"
3300,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,12,"Well, it's important.
I mean, we've been there before, don't want to go back, but I mean the impact is largely on, firstly Ford Credit.
The -- we have to fund them to the tune of over $40 million (ph) a year.
And of course some of that is unsecured, some of its securitized.
So, it impacts the size of the market that we have available for that funding and obviously, the cost of it.
Now, ultimately Ford Credit is going to pass that cost along to Automotive.
So, at the end of the day it sits in Automotive in terms of the impact.
But it's important.
It's not around -- I think it's an important thing.
It's not around the balance sheet, it's not around the fact that we pay a dividend.
It's around the operating performance of the business.
That's very, very clear and talking with the rating agencies that even if we stop paying the dividend, that doesn't address the operating performance.
So we're extremely focused.
Going back to what Jim talked about around the EBIT margin, return on invested capital, we are extremely focused on getting this business back onto a stronger operating performance track, because that is the issue that the rating agencies are expressing concern around.
Obviously, it relates to cash flow generation at the end of the day.
But that is what we've got to focus on -- is that issue.
It's not a dividend issue, it's an operating performance issue.
"
3301,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,13,"Well, we haven't not done that.
I mean we're just simply saying it's not going to be in 2020.
Since we had put that marker out there and based on what's happened since then, we are compelled to share with you that we don't see at the moment a way to get there.
So we're simply saying not in 2020, but as I mentioned in my earlier comments, certainly we're trying to get there as soon as we can.
But I'm not going to put a time frame on it, because we (ph) will have to come back again and change it.
"
3302,F,2018,3,bob-shanks,executive-vice-president-and-chief-financial-officer,False,14,"We haven't adjusted our EBIT guidance reduction or guidance.
We had a guidance on EPS and that is still within the range of $1.30 to $1.50.
We've not provided any guidance on EBIT.
So it is incorrect to assume that there is a reduction.
"
3303,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn and thanks everyone for joining us today.
I'll briefly cover three topics before I turn it over to Bob for more detail and then we'll take your questions.
First, let me provide an overview of third quarter results and our 2018 guidance, which remains unchanged.
And then secondly, I'd like to share with you specific detail on the progress we are making against our strategy to create value for all of our stakeholders.
And then third, I want to provide a look ahead at a number of upcoming touch points we'll have with investors and provide an update on our mid-term guidance.
So let's get started.
If you would please turn to slide 2.
Starting with the quarter, top line grew 3% in the face of significant global sectorwide headwinds and our Company EBIT margin was sequentially unchanged despite substantially lower volume.
Our North America performance was strong with an EBIT margin of nearly 9% and I have to say that the North American leadership team has done a great job optimizing every opportunity to improve growth and returns.
And now we're heading into a really busy and exciting period of product renewal, which you'll hear more about.
I believe North America results demonstrate the early evidence that our fitness actions and commitment to focus on higher return opportunities are now taking hold and this is driving a more resilient business model.
Within North America results this quarter, we achieved $1 billion mix improvement from our strong product line focus, including more F-150 and more Super Duties that had record transaction prices.
And additionally, the F-Series share of the full-size segment increased in the quarter and Ford continued to be the number one best-selling brand in the US.
We also remain the number one selling brand for commercial vehicles in Europe.
In fact, we gained commercial vehicle share reaching our highest quarterly share in over 25 years.
In addition, we delivered record year-to-date sales of Ranger in Asia Pacific.
I'm delighted that our entire -- our earlier approximations that we can find that right winning portfolio has this positive news in the quarter.
Our future work on our portfolio is directed at making this even better.
In addition, Ford Credit quarterly results were the best since 2011.
We delivered positive Company operating cash flow and we generated earnings per share of $0.29.
Our balance sheet and available liquidity remained at healthy levels.
We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating.
In the quarter, we had over $23 billion of Company cash and our target balance of $20 billion with liquidity over $34 billion.
Turning to the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance of a range of $1.30 to $1.50 and positive cash flow, albeit lower than 2017.
So now let's go to page 3.
This framework, which we have shown before illustrates our plan for creating value for our stakeholders.
At the highest level, the obvious strength of our F-Series trucks and our Transit family of commercial vehicles has positively driven margin in recent years.
When I look back at these successes, there's not much I would have wanted to change.
But it's clear these strengths probably masked weaknesses in the fitness of our overall business and also shrouded poor design elements of other areas of the business where we destroyed value.
To be a great company, my message to everyone is we have to attack this opportunity.
In an answer to the question what have we been working on this past year, we've developed and implemented a plan to redesign the Company to dramatically improve the fitness of the overall business, address those areas of weakness I just pointed out and prepare Ford to win in a fast changing future.
Our mission is to build on our traditional strengths, while capitalizing on the sweeping changes brought about by propulsion technology, shared mobility and artificial intelligence that are all ushering in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world.
Now this transformation is predicated on the best and highest use of our capital across four growth drivers.
Earlier, I mentioned the efforts on creating and bringing to market a winning portfolio.
So let me start with that.
At a high level, we plan to fortify and grow our leading position in trucks, our leading position in commercial vehicles and performance vehicles, such as the Mustang.
Despite our heritage in SUVs, we know we're not the leader in this space, but we certainly are a solid player.
Customers consistently rave about products like the Ford Explorer and the new Lincoln Navigator.
This is a multi-billion dollar opportunity and we're moving with urgency to leverage our SUV expertise and brand image to become a global leader in utilities.
This drives clear choices like our decision to phase out sedans over time in North America.
Not only are customers increasingly migrating to different silhouettes but also because of their lack of profitability, these traditional sedans destroy value.
We can reallocate that capital to higher return opportunities.
This decision means new entries in utilities trucks and white space vehicles with new silhouettes that will be more attractive to customers while delivering higher returns.
Last week, my team and I hosted almost 4,000 North American Ford dealers in Las Vegas and we showed them how our lineup of nameplates will grow in the next five years versus where we are now.
Overall, by 2020, we expect 75% of our line-up in the US to be new or refreshed.
In fact, I hope you saw the new Built Ford Proud ad campaign we launched this past weekend to support this product push.
To deliver this fresh and more vibrant lineup around the world is not enough just to reallocate capital to higher return opportunities though.
We also have to improve in two key areas, engineering efficiency and product line management and both of these will deliver huge benefits downstream.
You've heard Hau Thai-Tang, our executive over product development explain how we're moving to five flexible global architectures that will give us the ability to deliver more product faster and with that less capital.
We believe that we can reduce the time it takes from sketch to showroom by 20% while improving capital efficiency by an additional 20%.
In addition, we have implemented new product line management teams.
Now these are agile cross-functional teams, they are responsible for product lines from end-to-end including P&L.
This brings us much closer to our customers and their wants and needs.
We have established clear lines of responsibility for every product line with the mandate to deliver appropriate level of returns.
The next area of focus is propulsion.
And we use that term not to confuse you but because we're going to offer our dealers a portfolio of power trains to give our customers a variety of options.
We have the internal combustion engine, we have hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric.
And yes, we are deploying -- we are redeploying capital and increasing investment in electrification.
And I'm even more excited about the strategic view that we've developed here.
We're going to electrify our most popular name plates like the F-150, Explorer, Mustang and Transit.
We'll leverage hybrids to deliver fuel economy and performance similar to the way we employed EcoBoost so
successfully in the past decade.
For example, we currently offer hybrids on three of our US name plates.
And by 2022, we will have offer hybrids or plug-in hybrid powertrains or both on 12 nameplates.
We're developing a suite of fully electric vehicles that is aspire to have an impact like other exceptional nameplates you associate with Ford.
An example is the performance utility vehicle coming in 2020 that has received early reporting from the press and yes, we will also offer fully electric commercial vehicles.
In fact, further on electrification, we will leverage partnerships with Zotye and JMC in China and Mahindra in India to deliver affordable electric vehicles at scale.
As you know, our customers have an intimate trust in Ford Motor Company and we are confirming to them with all of this kind of news that Ford is committed as a company to meet the Paris Accord for CO2.
And we love the challenge of doing it in a way that excites them, helps them get their work done, while supporting strong returns for Ford.
We are making real strides in autonomous vehicles and are in a far better competitive position than we were only a year ago.
In August, we formed our stand-alone Autonomous Vehicles LLC.
As expected and intended, we're receiving significant interest from potential partners and financial investors.
And due to the trust our customers have in the Blue Oval, we're singularly focused on developing a profitable business model guided by safety.
Look for an event we have planned in Miami early next month to share much more about our self-driving system and business model innovation related to autonomy.
And then with mobility, when we refer to mobility in our discussions, I want to be very clear.
Mobility is all about wrapping software and services in new offerings to our customers.
We already made a financial commitment to build our transportation mobility cloud.
This is an open platform through which Ford and its partners can deliver a myriad of products and services that will drive higher margins and recurring revenue streams that enable greater functionality and productivity for our customers.
For example, yesterday Ford Commercial Solutions announced a partnership with Avis to connect more than 35,000 Ford vehicles in the Avis fleet.
These vehicles will allow Avis customers to manage their entire rental experience through the Avis mobile app.
Additionally, these Ford vehicles will provide valuable telemetry data in real time, including odometer, fuel level and vehicle condition updates, allowing Avis fleet to quickly process an information to prepare vehicles for customers.
No longer will you have to record your fuel when you turn your car in.
Now having provided that overview, I want to emphasize that we have extremely -- we've had an extremely productive quarter in terms of putting building blocks in place to support that strategy.
Let me share some key highlights here.
In the US, our product defense started in earnest with the launch of the Edge and Edge ST.
And just this past Monday, Joe Hinrichs and I celebrated the start of production for the new range of pickup in the United States, which will be on sale early next year.
This all new focus is off to a strong start in Europe.
And in China, we introduced the Territory SUV, which will be key to reaching new customers in second tier Chinese cities.
In terms of autonomy, we just announced our second test city in the US, which is Washington DC.
Now this will allow us to accelerate and build on the work we are already doing in Miami.
I was also a part of an announcement where we are teaming up with Uber and Lyft to support a concept called SharedStreets.
This is a platform designed to leverage data to improve urban mobility.
The data sets pledged by all three of us will provide the public and private sectors with new tools to reduce congestion and emissions, while improving the efficiency of city streets, making it easier and safer for everyone to get around.
Let me add that our performance in China clearly has been disappointing.
I can assure you the leadership of the Company has sworn the issue and we identified what is required for a turnaround plan.
Importantly, you read yesterday that we named a new CEO of Ford China.
I'm excited about the hire of Mr.
Anning Chen, whose background, believe it or not, includes a stint at Ford more than a decade ago.
Anning's appointment allows us to reorganize our AP regions so that China is now a stand-alone business reporting directly to Jim Farley to ensure that we improve speed, execution and local expertise.
No doubt, you read about the fact that we've recently kicked off a redesign of our global salaried workforce.
This is a new approach and it will improve costs.
But that's only a secondary benefit.
The sustainable fitness targets that I put out there ensure that we recognize that our organization must be more agile, accountable, flatter and faster.
This is important to the kind of company we're trying to become.
This kind of fundamental change, especially in how we work and what we work on cannot be solely designed from the executive suite and executed top-down.
The goals here are to flatten the organization and increase manager span of control.
We've already had success at Ford and we have given people this type of approach and the chance to redesign their teams and how they work.
This isn't a new experiment.
Finally, the North American team, for example, has set up energy rooms where cross-functional teams focus on specific product opportunities.
We're smiling because there's no private offices, no endless power point, no faceless emails and no long meetings.
It's been a revelation to see how fast they have moved to improve the business, evidenced by the strong margin you're seeing that North American has delivered in the past two quarters.
And yes to the question, we are racing to replicate this globally over the next few months and we plan to provide an update on the efficiencies we're getting from this in future calls.
The transformation I've just shared with you is (inaudible) fraction of what we as a team have imagined and we clearly are executing.
For example, we previously told you that our marketing function needed an overhaul to become more fit, effective and modern, especially in terms of leveraging big data and technology.
Well, we've taken action.
Earlier this month, we announced key changes to bolster our in-house capability and we moved to a new agency model that will yield more creativity and substantial efficiencies.
We're addressing real issues.
We are moving quickly to redesign the business in support of our stated strategy.
With that progress, I know that you want to hear more about how we will implement the $11 billion restructuring plan which we highlighted in the second quarter as well at that time we talked about ongoing discussions with various strategic partners such as the one with VW and the partnership with Mahindra.
These are big pieces of the picture that I'm trying to paint and we're fully committed to sharing detail as soon as we can.
But I can't allow to get ahead of the process.
I assure you that the need to get our stakeholders up to speed is the priority for me and the entire Company.
But I've committed to you that we will have several touch points with you in the coming weeks and months to get more specific detail of areas of important progress in AVs, the extensive fitness plans that we are now implementing and progress on our strategic partnerships.
So before I turn it over to Bob, let me touch on our medium-term targets.
There are adjustments here given the dynamics of the environment I want you to pay close attention.
We know that the underlying earnings power of the Company is at least at an 8% EBIT margin or better with a high-teen return on invested capital.
I mean, we know this because 150% of our EBIT is already coming from products generating mid-teen margins with an ROIC above 40%.
We've been transparent about this.
In April, on a call like this, we said, we believe we can hit an 8% EBIT margin and a high-teen ROIC by 2020.
And at the time that was assuming reasonable economic conditions.
We also said that our improved fitness would drive a more resilient business model at all points of the cycle, which I want to confirm we continue to standby.
Well, the news today is the current external environment has driven higher costs and uncertainty for the entire sector.
And as we said last quarter, we had an unexpected deterioration in our business in both Europe and China.
As a result of these factors, our current forecast shows we will not reach our EBIT margin and ROIC targets by 2020.
However, as I tell you as I told the Board, we're not standing still.
We're attacking everything that is in our control.
We're working with urgency to redesign our business to operate more profitably.
Our fitness initiatives are tracking as planned, our restructuring and strategic partnering initiatives are progressing and our reallocation of capital toward a winning portfolio of products and services is beginning to deliver results.
Our progress on these fronts gives us even more confidence that we are building a more resilient and vibrant high-performing Company capable over time of attaining EBIT margins of 8% or better with an ROIC in the high-teens.
So at this point, I'll turn it over to Bob and I'll be back to you in a moment to answer questions.
Bob?
"
3304,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Yes, I think if I could have some license to think of the language a little differently, let me set this up for Bob, which is the way Bob and I think about this is I've come into the Company trying to assess the design of the business kind of at an underlying level.
Design for, as you know John, reduced capital, higher margins but there is other things, clock speed, where we were talking about things moving faster.
And when you think about that, I sit in your shoes and you say, hey, when will we know this? At what rate are you making these things happen? What I remind everybody is, we first have to find the areas that need the attention, we're through that.
We then have to design the solutions for them.
We're through a lot of that, but not all of it.
And then we have to put them in place and perform.
So if you're reading any hesitancy from me, it's not that we don't know where we're going or we don't know how to do it.
It's that it's a massive undertaking that we have to have very thoughtfully orchestrated, because my experience in doing this is the worst thing we could do is disrupt our business and we are going to do that.
So now the accounting of it and things like that, I'm going to turn to Bob and let him give your opinion on that.
"
3305,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Well, again, I'll turn this to Jim Farley because Jim has been making a trip there almost every three weeks and you've heard about the news in the organization I've been talking to the partner.
While we've been fixing Ford's problems, there's a lot going on in China.
And Jim you might share what you are seeing in the last three months in China large.
"
3306,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Well, the good news is -- great question, good news is we have not seen any sentiment change at the consumer level.
In fact Lincoln is up about 3% year-over-year for us despite having to take pricing.
So we see continued very strong demand, we watch the favorability of both the Ford and Lincoln brand monthly and we have not seen any change in the favorability of the brand as of yet.
And this is a very important question about localization of Lincoln.
We haven't been specific about the model, but one of the keys to our profit improvement plan for China will be accelerating our localization.
We've already announced a Ford modeled Explorer as well as a Lincoln model and that's very key to our progress.
"
3307,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"Yeah, it's almost nothing.
It's almost all product mix and about 60% of it is that we're selling as a percent of our total sales we're selling more F-Series, more Navigators, more expeditions, more higher margin products and about 40% is that we're selling less of cars, but also the Escape.
And I think that's -- the Escape one is an interesting one.
We're going to launch a new Escape next year, and Jim might want to comment on it.
We're actually taking conscious actions decisions to kind of pull back a bit on volume because we're trying -- not trying, but we're protecting, if you will, residual values and protecting the nameplate brand as we prepare for the launch of the new one.
So as a result, less of those, so it's benefited us to the tune of favorable mix overall.
Do you want to comment on that? I think, it's a great example of -- I like the work we're doing around the product rooms.
"
3308,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"You're asking the question in the five-year plan what has happened in one quarter?
"
3309,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,6,"Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
I just -- I am trying to get at how precise you want that to be.
So this is where I guess I was a minute ago that we're seeing definite benefits now in our business.
We said these were backend loaded because of the description I gave you a moment ago when I was reminding you how these processes get identified to be reengineered to be put in place to realize value in those four steps.
So then more value comes in the future.
But it is happening and I've cited for you in North America is where I'm seeing early benefits.
There is a concept that we've called yield management, which is one of the '19 and that we're seeing real-time benefits there.
"
3310,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,7,"Again, David, I'm sorry, but let me see if I can reframe that.
So you realize that refreshing -- the freshening that we just have done that we're just launching, the kind of the capital that we have spent there tied to the new products is one thing (inaudible).
And this concept of this architecture is all the new things that are coming after this most recent refreshing.
And so we have in the five-year plan definite capital improvements.
I think I mentioned that in the text.
"
3311,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,8,"Yes, let me tag team with Joe here because he, remember as part of his executive role, helped put this new architecture.
And Joe, what's your sense?
"
3312,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,9,"Thanks for the questions.
Operator
And I believe we have time for one last question.
Our next question is from line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.
"
3313,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,10,"Thank you, Itay.
Operator
That concludes the question-and-answer session.
I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Hackett for closing remarks.
"
3314,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,11,"Thank you very much.
Just want to confirm quickly that we're moving with urgency to execute against this strategy.
We are pleased with signs of our success.
These early signs including strong results as we just talked about with the EBIT margin in North America of almost 9%.
We're very, very happy with the strong balance sheet with over $34 billion in liquidity and we're making great progress on the product portfolio.
We can emphasize that we had enough dealers last week with lots of applause supported that.
The redesign of the business includes the strategic partnerships with VW and Mahindra, they're all on track.
And finally, we look forward to sharing more about this global redesign of the Company.
We are going to be coming to you more frequently including we're going to talk about these strategic partnerships in the near future.
Thanks for your coverage and we look forward to our next call.
Operator
This does conclude the Ford Motor Company third quarter earnings conference call.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.

3315,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,12,"And John, just to confirm to you, you know that the point where you're examining these kinds of options, if there was expedient options or more big bang ways of doing things, yes, I was open to all kinds of ideas like that, that's what we've already plowed through.
And so your understanding tonight should be just the way Bob and I are describing.

3316,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,13,
3317,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,14,"And John, it would be -- it wouldn't be fair to say, it takes the full five years, right? So part of the reason we're going to have this, a gathering where Joe Hinrichs takes you through a deeper understanding of the fitness actions, is that you can see the range of things in terms of some of them are, what I call the now, near, far kind of clock.
Some of them are now.
Some of them are actually impacting now.
I think we're trying to be really clear that North America's -- some of its results are from many of the fitness actions that we put in place a year ago.
But you're also right that some are going to take longer because they're more complicated design challenges.
"
3318,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,15,"Yes, I think it's really more around timing.
We had expected to hit those types of numbers in our five-year planning period.
Back earlier in the year, we saw the opportunity to do that earlier through the impact of the fitness actions, but subsequent to that we've seen more bad news on commodities, some related to policy, some not.
We've seen issues on exchange, we've seen South America take another dip and so forth.
So there is -- Turkey is another one, Russia.
So, there are other issues.
And then frankly, what we saw happen in Europe and in China that was unrelated to externals, we expect and are addressing them very aggressively, but as you kind of flow that through to 2020 that could still have some sort of negative impact versus what we had expected back in April.
Tried for that not to happen, but based on looking at the numbers today, that's where we are and we've just got to disclose what we see and that's where we are.
But certainly we're not backing off and we certainly see the ability to achieve the 8% margin and the mid-teen ROIC in the years ahead.
"
3319,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,16,"Yeah.
"
3320,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,17,"I think that's a fair question.
Let me give that to Jim Farley.
"
3321,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,18,"Thank you.
Operator
And our next question is from line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.
"
3322,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,19,"Yes.
Thanks, Joe.
I'm going to let Bob to add to this.
But in my text, remember I made reference to resiliency more than once because one of the things we hope to convince you of is the design of the business has more resiliency in the downturn.
So, it's my expectation that you wouldn't be modeling that the way you used to.
But Bob how would you?
"
3323,F,2018,3,james-p.-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer,False,20,"Yeah, and we want to emphasize that we don't know how we've lost control of the way that's been projected.
But it's -- we've been consistent saying that we plan to pay the regular dividend in this five-year plan.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.
"
3324,F,2018,3,itay-michaeli,citi,True,0,"Great, thank you.
Good evening.
Maybe just one more on the 2018 guidance for Bob.
Is there any bias in terms of the range on the EPS or kind of the factors that would cause it to be at the low versus the higher end of that? And then maybe just to confirm, you expect Q4 still have positive operating cash flow?
"
3325,F,2018,3,itay-michaeli,citi,True,1,"Great.
And then on North America I mean it looks like if I back out some of the recent recalls and some of the issues in Q2, you're running comfortably above 9%.
And you talked about the product cycle you have coming in the next couple of years.
I guess what will prevent North America from running even above the 10% you previously talked about in the next couple of years?
"
3326,F,2018,3,itay-michaeli,citi,True,2,"Great.
That's very helpful.
That's all I had.

"
3328,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Yeah.
Great.
Got a couple of questions here.
I think, I'll start with 2018 guidance.
You held the $1.30 to $1.50, but you bought your tax rate down from 13% to 10%.
I think that implies a couple of hundred million dollars of EBIT where your guidance got lowered.
It looks like that might just be South America instead of improving just being flat, but wondering if there's any other buckets that we should be looking at for that implied EBIT guidance reduction?
"
3329,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,1,"Okay.
(multiple speakers) Follow-up on that later.
Jim, on the fitness plans that you've outlined, about $25.5 million.
I know, it's over a long period of time, maybe just wondering how much, if any, has accrued to the bottom line so far in this quarter.
"
3330,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,2,"Well, I'm asking if there's -- just to see if there's been any traction with those cost savings initiatives dropping to the bottom line? Just that.
"
3331,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,3,"But nothing quantifiable?
"
3332,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,4,"Okay.
And then just lastly from me, since you've outlined the module architectures.
I'm curious, how much CapEx has been already spent on that transition.
How long that's been contemplated within the organization and if there's any incremental spend that needs to be done in order to get you there and transition the portfolio?
"
3333,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,5,"You did, I just -- I'm asking because other OEMs have discussed developing module architectures and it's taken multiple years for them to get to that and deploy it.
So the question really is how much of that has already been done or established and behind us versus going forward and needs to be spent while you're watching those products.
"
3334,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,6,"Understood.
That's helpful.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
"
3335,F,2018,3,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,7,
3336,F,2018,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,0,"Good afternoon.
Thanks for taking the question.
Maybe just a follow on some of the longer-term planning and some of the market dynamics that you didn't anticipate that caused you to take that down.
Have you similarly built in some contingencies around potential variation your assumptions for the North America market or does that also assume that we remain roughly around the current levels?
"
3337,F,2018,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,1,"That's helpful.
And then just the second question is, not to get too semantic (inaudible) I think there's a lot of investor concerns and questions over this.
On slide 11 when you say committed to the regular dividend through the cycle, is that at current levels or just to continue to pay a dividend through the cycle?
"
3338,F,2018,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,2,"Okay, thank you.
"
3339,F,2018,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,3,"Yeah, thanks.
"
3340,F,2018,3,joseph-spak,rbc-capital-markets,True,4,
3341,F,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,0,"Thanks ,everybody.
Just got two questions.
First, one on restructuring.
I want to ask the question, what does $12 billion -- I'm sorry, what does $11 billion of charges or $7 billion of cash charges buy you in the restructuring world? But am I wasting everyone's time here? Are you gonna -- is there anything else you can say in terms of geography, function, region? Anything else tonight besides the number?
"
3342,F,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,1,"Hi.
"
3343,F,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,2,"Okay.
Tonight's not the night for that? Okay, all right.
The second question, Jim, is to you.
I think the postponement of the Capital Markets Day is kind of a pretty big deal, Jim.
These types of things you're introducing into the strategy, like spending $11 billion over three to five years, dealing with key stakeholders, tech partners, revamping China.
It requires someone to be in the seat a fair amount of time to see it through.
So, to be direct with you, Jim, whenever you do reschedule the Capital Markets Day, to be clear with investors, will you be the one delivering the message, or will someone else be doing it? And I mean that with all due respect.
You're a very spry 63, and you got great contributions to the culture and to accelerating cultural change.
But I think it's important, and I'm kind of reflecting a fair amount of sentiment in the investment community around management continuity as well.
So, I really would appreciate a comment on that.
Thank you.
"
3344,F,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,3,"I appreciate that, Bob.
And listen, Ford's a 115-year-old company.
It's not your first rodeo here in terms of restructuring over that 115 years.
I just can't really think of an example where, for such an important restructuring and such large numbers, and you're kind of almost teasing the market with these very large numbers.
Even not just for investors, but internally for your own people who are gonna read the newspaper and say, ""What's going on?"" I mean, doesn't -- I'm just -- I'm concerned that -- and seeing examples of people that restructured successfully, including one we lost today, laying it all out in a narrative that can be understood, that can be on the back of a card, like from the Mulally days.
That had a powerful impact, because I think the risk is that this industry is so dynamic, possibly -- yeah, very, very dynamic and cyclical, that as that narrative plays out, the rules change, your free cash flow moves negative.
And then we're dealing with a moving bar, and we don't know what to compare it to.
Sorry, that's just feedback.
I really do hope you can reconsider this communication strategy, because it's just not good enough, Bob.
"
3345,F,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,4,"Okay.
"
3346,F,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,5,"Thanks, Bob.
Thanks, Jim.
Operator
Thank you.
Next, we have a question from Ryan with JPMorgan.
"
3347,F,2018,2,adam-jonas,morgan-stanley,True,6,
3348,F,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"Good evening, guys.
Maybe just to follow up on this large spend of $7 billion in cash, $11 billion in EBIT.
Bob, as you think about this as a CFO sort of philosophically, with maybe not even getting into details, I mean, is this the kind of thing that you look at as an 18 to 24-month payback on a standard basis, or is this sort of a much more holistic turn in the company to something that is totally different than what we're looking at right now?
"
3349,F,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,1,"So, it sounds like you've identified sort of the outperforming products and the underperforming products.
So, if we look at the rough 6.5 million units of global volume that you have on a consolidated basis, I mean, are we looking at a third of that being sort of the high-performing, a third being low-performing and one-third in the middle being sort of stuff that you can fix and move up? I mean, what are the rough numbers? I mean, are we gonna see potentially significantly lower volume in the future? Is the 6.5 million going to be four or three? Is that the kind of stuff that's going on in the thought process?
"
3350,F,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,2,"Okay.
And then, Jim, you've got a great management team underneath you with Joe, and Jim, and Marcy, and a whole bunch of other people.
The plans keep shifting, and it's kind of difficult to operate in that kind of environment.
Is there any risk of retention or any idea to go out with retention packages, because it sounds like this is going to be a pretty big tariff, and you want to make sure -- I mean, it's a great team.
You want to make sure you keep them together.
How do you think about human capital in this equation?
"
3351,F,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,3,"Okay.
And then just lastly, Bob, when you look at the outlook for cash flow, it didn't have the turn, but still positive.
Is that still part of it? I mean, you're saying just the operating cash flow was lower year-over-year versus 2017, but the still positive clause was taken out.
Is that reading too much into it, or?
"
3352,F,2018,2,john-murphy,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,4,"But still positive.
Okay.
Thank you so much.

3354,F,2018,2,lynn-antipas-tyson,executive-director-of-investor-relations,False,0,"Thank you, Imani.
Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call.
Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President of Global Markets.
Also joining us are Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President, Global Operations; and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit.
Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework we unveiled last quarter.
Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail, and then Jim Farley will provide a provide a deeper dive into our global markets.
After Jim Farley's comments, we'll open up the call up for questions, and then following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.
Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references.
These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S.
GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.
Today's discussions include forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance.
Actual results may differ from those stated, and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 43.
In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.
Company EBIT and EPS are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis.
Now, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.
"
3355,F,2018,2,lynn-antipas-tyson,executive-director-of-investor-relations,False,1,
3356,F,2018,2,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,0,"Hi, good evening.
Thanks for taking my questions.
I'm gonna ask a question on the $11 billion of restructuring charge and $7 billion of cash outlay in another way.
So, I understand you're working on a variety of possible actions that you're not ready to disclose, including because they may not be finalized, you have a variety of stakeholders, and it might not be value maximizing to announce these actions sooner rather than later, such as plans to exit a country or region, etc.
But with that said, now that you have disclosed the potential costs of restructuring, can you also disclose the potential benefits? So, for example, what is the return on the $11 billion or the $7 billion? What is the payback period on that investment? What is the improvement to margin and free cash flow that that spending could bring about? Are these costs simply necessary to achieve your targeted 8% EBIT margin and high teens ROIC, or does this take you above and beyond the 2020 targets?
"
3357,F,2018,2,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,1,"Okay.
And then the last topic area I want to explore is Asia-Pacific.
So, just looking at the China EBIT bridge on slide 28, and you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think the way to interpret this chart is that the change in China equity income is reflected in the JVs category.
And then the volume/mix and net pricing column to the left of that relates to, I guess, consolidated China operations.
Is that right? And if so, I had not realized that your consolidated operations there were material enough to result in that type of a swing factor, $141 million from volume/mix, $101 million from net pricing.
Maybe Bob can help me understand that.
And then secondly, Jim, I remember meeting with you shortly after 1Q results, and you seemed pretty excited about the potential financial contribution of refreshing something like 80 or 90% of your portfolio in China this year.
After your sales performance and profitability in China in 2Q, how are you feeling about the ability to benefit from those launches?
"
3358,F,2018,2,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,2,"I see.
Thanks for the explanation.
"
3359,F,2018,2,ryan-brinkman,jpmorgan,True,3,
3360,F,2018,2,james-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,0,"Thank you, Bob.
Well, it's great to see the progress in North America.
In fact, this morning, J.D.
Powers reported the results of the annual APEAL survey, and for the first time in history, a domestic product won the top score, the Lincoln Navigator.
Beyond the products, the 10% margin has galvanized our team in North America.
Our performance in the quarter reflects the underlying strength of our current portfolio and mix of trucks, and the intense focus the team has on fitness.
You can feel the momentum.
We have built strong, profitable, competitive moats, like our LCV business.
F-Series and Transit make up the industry leader in commercial vehicles, thanks not only to the product, but our distribution and commercial capabilities.
Our F-Series this year is on pace for a record-setting year, with sales up 5% and equally strong pricing, despite an incredibly intense competitive market.
Talking about the revitalization of our utilities, our first big launch, the Expedition/Navigator -- well, sales are up 55%, and we are having even stronger results on pricing.
All of this is before we refresh 75% of our North America lineup next year, mostly utilities.
We know that when we play to our strengths for customers, we drive strong profits and returns.
In contrast, the erosion we've seen in both Europe and China is unacceptable, highlighting why we are changing our portfolio in these regions to profitably grow.
Turning to Europe and our deteriorating results, despite being only 30% of our revenue, our LCV business continues to be the bright spot, with 13% EBIT margins.
This reflects our strong core portfolio, with Ford as the number one best selling LCV brand, led by Transit and our vans, and Ranger, which is now the best-selling pickup in the region.
But despite this strength, one of our underlying issues is that we are behind on the shift to utilities, and now our portfolio under-indexed on this highly profitable and growing segment.
The biggest issue we face is the UK.
We're the number one brand in the market.
Back in '16, we made $1.2 billion in Europe, and most of it was in the UK.
Brexit and the continued weak sterling has been a fundamental headwind for our European business.
This explains the majority of our deterioration, along with the age and mix of our utilities and cost.
Taking all of these factors into account, we now expect to deliver a loss this year in Europe.
To deliver on our long-term target of 6% EBIT margin, clearly, we have to redesign Europe, centering the operations on our profitable LCV business.
We are aggressively attacking costs and driving improved capital efficiencies across the business.
Importantly, capital allocation plans now align with utility and the LCV business opportunity.
Turning to China, the deterioration of our business in this important global market has been swift.
When we completed the deep dive into the root cause, we exposed serious shortfalls in our go-to-market capabilities, including inadequate dealer profitability; excess stock, including our high volume C cars.
We now maintain -- we haven't maintained a fresh enough product lineup for this rapidly changing and dynamic China market.
These missteps, together, with our uncompetitive cost structure, has resulted in a significant deterioration in our 2Q results.
We have taken urgent action.
We've addressed the dealer profitability, also our stock and production, and we've completely reset our merchandising.
New products are on their way.
60% of our lineup will be refreshed or new by the end of next year.
However, until all of our utilities are launched in China, we continue to face this mix deficit.
We are improving our cost competitiveness with aggressive fitness actions, as well as more localized product, as Bob said, in China, such as the Explorer.
We're close to hiring a new CEO for Ford China, and we have already onboarded a number of local Chinese talent in key management positions, such as marketing and sales leads, for both Ford and Lincoln to drive not only our strategy, but they're already reinvigorating our sales.
China is already the world's largest automotive market, growing to twice the size of the U.S.
market by 2025.
And I can assure you, we understand the importance of getting our China business back on track.
This will complement the progress we've already made in the region, with ASEAN and Australia, thanks to Ranger and India, as Bob mentioned, with the work we're doing with Mahindra.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to end on this.
Bob mentioned the sizable provision for restructuring contingencies of $11 billion and $7 billion of cash-related effects.
With this and other fitness actions, we are determined to reshape our portfolio of products and markets.
Complementing this is our aggressive reallocation of capital to regions with products that people love in the most profitable segments.
We're expanding our incredible lineup of Ford commercial vehicles.
We're growing the range of white-hot utilities -- not just Expedition, but in all sizes and price points.
And we're completing the build-out of an incredible urban crossover lineup with world-class energy efficiency.
Operator, let's go to the Q&A.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Certainly.
As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, simply press *, followed by the number 1 on your telephone keypad.
Again, that is *1 to ask a question.
And we'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster.
Okay.
Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
"
3361,F,2018,2,james-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,1,"Yeah, thanks for your question.
We have 16 launches in China, all of them in the second half, so we are still very optimistic about the impact of those launches.
We have addressed the go-to-market capabilities and gaps that we've seen, and dealer profitability, etc.
Most of the launches, like the new Focus or new Escort, are sedan silhouettes, and most of the profit uplift for us and others is really around utilities.
So, as we build out in '19 and '20, the whole new lineup of utilities in China, that's when we're gonna get the lift.
So, it's gonna be great to see that revenue build in the second half.
The profit will come with our utilities.
"
3362,F,2018,2,james-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,2,"Well, we're really confident about our leadership position in the truck market.
Obviously, we have very new product.
Super Duty is doing extremely well.
We have good stocks, but they're on the low side.
We've had great transaction price improvements, despite the sell-down of multiple brands' trucks.
So, we continue to expand our sales and unit volume.
We have a refreshed product.
As you know, we have the diesel F-150 at 30 miles per gallon, which is great for merchandising and for customers.
We have the new Raptor coming, which is very popular and a significant part of our mix now.
And Super Duty just continues to get traction.
Customers seem to really appreciate the powertrain improvements of F-150, including the 10-speed transmission and the other changes we made.
So, we think we're in great shape.
"
3363,F,2018,2,james-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,3,"That's a great question.
We're through all of our past-year cars.
We have just S-MAX, Galaxy to go.
We still have the commercial vehicles to go.
It was definitely a lot of extra workload on the team, not only us, but also the homologation teams, but we are through it now.
It's not a material impact to us as a company financially.
We've probably had a tenth or two-tenths, maybe, lost just because the delay in getting homologation done in terms of our sales.
But we're on track and steaming along, which is really important for our light commercial lineup.
"
3364,F,2018,2,james-farley,executive-vice-president-and-president-of-global-markets,False,4,
3365,F,2018,2,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Yeah, great.
Talking about North America, how are you thinking about the back half competition from GM and FCA? They both had pickup truck-related headwinds due to their changeovers in the first half.
And I think both of them today said they're targeting approximately 100,000 increases from 1H to 2H in their wholesales.
So, how are you thinking about that increased supply coming into the market for pickup trucks? And are you anticipating any pricing pressure or again, that incremental competition for Ford North America in the second half of the year?
"
3366,F,2018,2,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,1,"Okay.
So, no anticipated headwinds.
Pickup trucks continue to be strong for Ford.
All right.
My second question, just on the Ford Autonomous Vehicle unit that was announced.
How is that business currently capitalized in terms of cash that's been allocated to it? How are you thinking about potential third-party investments? How imminent could that be? Have you been approached, are you approaching anyone, or is that more just setting it up down the road for potential investments?
"
3367,F,2018,2,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,2,"Okay.
That's helpful.
I'll follow up later with a few more.
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
"
3368,F,2018,2,david-tamberrino,goldman-sachs,True,3,
3369,F,2018,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,0,"Yes.
Thank you.
We had a lot of discussion around strategic repositioning and restructuring, and I guess we're not gonna get more answers there.
So, instead, I want to kind of ask a question more about just the week-to-week operational management in the quarter and how comfortable you are between the two Jims, Joe, Bob, that you're on top of these issues in Europe and China as they develop.
And I go back to in May, you reaffirmed your guidance, despite the Meridian fire, which indicated things were on track in North America.
But probably more broadly, there are at least no surprises or at least other offsets, and now we have this.
So, can you give us a sense just, A, of kind of what really changed so rapidly toward the end of May and June; and B, whether you feel, because I know, having been a consultant, it's easy to get to spend a lot of time planning with the five years out and forgetting about the five weeks out, how you make sure that part of the business is running well?
"
3370,F,2018,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,1,"And in terms of what led to guidance reaffirm, to guidance cut?
"
3371,F,2018,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,2,"Just finally, are you through the WLTP changeover, or is that going to pressure third quarter schedules as well?
"
3372,F,2018,2,brian-johnson,barclays,True,3,"Okay, thanks.

Clearly, as Jim said, our second quarter was challenging.
This was due in part to unexpected events over which we had little control, such as the fire at our U.S.
supplier Meridian.
It also reflects a policy environment that's increasingly uncertain, causing real unfavorable bottom line effects on the business, such as higher commodity cost beyond normal cyclical effects, as well as tariff-related impacts.
The quarter.
However.
also underscores the importance and urgency of the work well under way in Ford to redesign our business.
And as we do this.
how critical it is that we consistently focus our capital on areas where we have confidence of earning an appropriate return.
And where we don't.
we must and are addressing those issues.
Thus.
the $11 billion of EBIT contingencies with $7 billion in cash-related effects that Jim just mentioned.
It's important to highlight that we believe we can fund these cash effects without impinging on our other capital outlays.
including investments for growth and our regular dividend.
You'll note that all of the metrics for the quarter were lower than a year ago.
These declines were primarily driven by lower volume of high margin products in our North America business due to production disruptions caused by Meridian, along with performance issues in our China operations.
Now, at a high level, company revenue was about $39 billion.
Company adjusted EBIT was $1.7 billion, with an adjusted margin of 4.3%.
Adjusted EPS was $0.27, and this included an effective tax rate of about 21%.
And company cash and marketable securities at quarter end were about $25 billion, with total liquidity at about $36 billion.
On slide 10, the year-over-year bridge for company revenue, the $1 billion decline in revenue was more than explained by lower volume, fully explained by North America, which was the Meridian disruption, and Asia-Pacific, which was mainly our China consolidated operations.
All other factors improved.
Turning to slide 11, the company's adjusted EBIT was down $1.1 billion from a year ago.
This was more than explained by automotive.
As shown on slide 12, our automotive operations were profitable, generating an EBIT of $1.2 billion, driven by a $1.8 billion EBIT in North America.
This was offset in part by a combined EBIT loss of about $600 million in the operations outside North America, with each region in a loss position except ME&A, which delivered a record second quarter profit.
As shown below the graph, North America and Asia-Pacific accounted for nearly all the automotive EBIT decline due to the factors I've already mentioned.
The underlying strength of our North American business came through in the quarter.
As detailed on slide 15, we earned $1.8 billion, with an EBIT margin of 7.4%, despite the adverse impact at Meridian.
The year-over-year bridge for North America, which is detailed on slide 16, shows that effectively, the entire $579 million decline in EBIT was due to Meridian.
It's worth looking at this bridge more closely to get a better appreciation for North America's profit trajectory, supported by strong market factors.
If you exclude the impact of Meridian, the favorable effect of the gain from the IPO of Pivotal and the adverse impact of the Takata settlement, North America's EBIT margin jumps from 7.4% to 9.9%, the level of ongoing margin that we're working to deliver.
Now, in our earnings deck this quarter, we are providing you with greater transparency into the profitability and returns of each of our business units that Jim touched on, similar to what we did on our first quarter call for the total company.
The graphs show the major parts of each business disaggregated by high and low performance.
As you can see in slide 17, the majority of North America's business is strong and high-performing, with an EBIT of $12.5 billion, a margin of 18%, and a ROIC of 48%.
We plan to strengthen and expand this part of our North American business, and we've already begun to address the low-performing parts, demonstrated by our recent announcement to no longer allocate capital to traditional sedan silhouettes.
This is just one part of our effort to return North America to margins of at least 10% and to create a more resilient business.
Now, moving to South America on slide 19, the EBIT loss in the quarter of $178 million was unchanged from a year ago.
While overall industry conditions improved, and we held costs essentially flat, excluding the inflationary effects, this was completely offset by the significant weakening of local currencies, particularly the Argentine peso, and very high levels of inflation, especially in Argentina.
As slide 20 shows, our business in South America lacks a strong competitive position or profit pillars.
In fact, we have not earned an appropriate return on investment over the most recent economic cycle that spans from 2004 to the present.
For those reasons, we are moving on a significant redesign of our business model, focused on where to play and how to win.
Turning to Europe on slide 22, let me state plainly that we are disappointed with our performance.
The loss of $73 million compares to a profit of $122 million last year.
The decline in EBIT was driven by higher costs, primarily regulatory related, and unfavorable exchange, mainly sterling.
While market factors were slightly positive, we had expected a much stronger boost from the top line both in volume and net pricing.
Turning to slide 23, Europe, similar to North America, actually has a strong core product portfolio that last year represented more than 200% of the region's EBIT.
This quarter consists of commercial vehicles, including Ranger, our Kuga small utility, and select imports.
On the other hand, the low-performing part of our portfolio represents a majority of our volume, revenue, and capital deployed in the region, consisting principally of cars and multi-activity vehicles such as C-MAX.
Clearly, our European business requires a major redesign and refocus, particularly given the ongoing effects of Brexit on our most important and profitable market.
That work is already under way, focused on addressing the low-performing elements, and expanding and strengthening the healthy pillars of our portfolio.
It's important to recognize that partnerships, which are a part of our fitness toolkit, are already an integral part of our European operations, and going forward, we expect them to play an even greater role.
Let's turn now to Asia-Pacific.
Now, effective this quarter, we are breaking China results out separately, which encompasses our unconsolidated JVs plus our consolidated operations.
This provides investors greater transparency into how we are executing in this critical market and also how our business in Asia=Pacific outside of China is performing.
As you can see on slide 26, a summary of Asia-Pacific's key metrics, we had a very difficult quarter, with major year-over-year declines across all metrics, almost entirely driven by China.
As slide 27 indicates, the year-over-year decline in Asia-Pacific's EBIT totaled $561 million, with $506 million of this coming from our China operation and $55 million from the operations outside China.
At the total AP level, the year-over-year decline was due to lower volume and net pricing, as well as lower China JV net income.
Slide 28 provides the absolutes and year-over-year details for China, with the rest of the region shown at the bottom.
We are very disappointed in our performance in China.
We lost $483 million in the quarter, a decline of $506 million from last year.
The decline was driven by unfavorable market factors for Ford and Lincoln imports into China, and continued negative industry pricing.
The lower net pricing also includes adverse stock accrual effects driven by price changes in response to tariff changes.
The decline in the China JVs was driven by unfavorable volume and mix ,as well as lower net pricing, which was primarily industry related.
Since volumes in the JV were down year-over-year, we also saw a decline in royalties in compensation for engineering expense that Ford incurred in the past.
Given the large increase this year in Ford engineering expense to support a substantial expansion of our product portfolio, including all new BEVs, along with a number of imported products to be localized, the gap between Ford-incurred engineering expense and present-year royalties we received from the China JVs is substantial.
As shown below the chart, the operations in Asia-Pacific outside China were profitable, earning $89 million, which was down from a profit of $144 million a year ago.
The EBIT margin was 4.2%.
This decline was driven by unfavorable market factors, mainly in Australia and ASEAN.
India continued to improve, although it did incur a modest loss.
As slide 29 shows, in 2017, Asia-Pacific had a meaningful, high-performing business, anchored by Ranger, most utilities, Mondeo, and Mustang.
Moving forward, we're focused on getting our China business back on track, including localization of most imported products, sustaining the strong performers in the region outside of China, and getting appropriate returns from our business in India.
India is another example of where we're leveraging partnerships, specifically Mahindra, to strengthen our competitiveness.
Now, turning to slide 30, our mobility segment, including mobility services as well as autonomous vehicles, we saw EBIT loss of $181 million, which was down $118 million, with both the absolute loss and the year-over-year variance split about equally between mobility services and investments in autonomous vehicles.
Ford Credit had another strong quarter, as shown on slide 31, with modest growth in receivables, earning before-tax of $645 million, up $26 million, with very strong credit and consumer metrics.
Auction values in the quarter were up 4% from a year ago, and we now expect full-year average auction values to be up 1% to 2% at constant mix.
Operating cash flow in the quarter, detailed on slide 34 ,was a negative $1.8 billion, which was driven by unfavorable working capital and timing differences.
The balance sheet remains strong, as does our liquidity.
And finally, as shown on Slide 37, the company adjusted EPS bridge.
We have updated our full-year guidance from a range of $1.45 to $1.70 to a range of $1.30 to $1.50.
Based on the midpoint of each range, the decline of $0.18 ,or about 11%, reflects lower than expected contributions from Asia-Pacific and Europe, offset in part by stronger performance from North America, despite taking a substantial hit on commodities and Ford Credit, as well as a slightly lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%.
With that, I'd now like to turn it over to Jim Farley, who's gonna share insights on our North America, Europe, and China businesses.
Jim?
"
3375,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,1,"Could I just comment on the question around restructuring?
"
3376,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,2,"Well, we're looking at that.
I mean obviously, when you go market by market, and we even provided a few specific comments today that would tell you in certain regions that the majority of volume or revenue is actually low-performing.
We haven't done that across the board.
But your supposition, John, is correct in terms of the magnitude of what we're having to address.
But what I would also remind you is that there's a capital reallocation to new things.
So, while certainly, some things will be left behind and they should be, there will be new things that we'll be investing in that actually are already more friendly to us, we're already strong, and we see ways that we can expand our portfolio in those areas, both, if you will, from a horizontal standpoint as well as vertically.
And also, Jim is working to identify and get ahead of future trends, and try to get us in the forefront of providing products to address those consumer needs, so we don't find ourselves in the future in a situation where we're under-indexed, for example, in utilities in many parts of the world where so many customers have moved.
"
3377,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,3,"No, no, I'm laughing because I looked at the slides this afternoon.
I said, oh, I forgot to add that.
Yes, positive cash flow, but lower than last year.
Thank you for asking that.
"
3378,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,4,
3379,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,5,"Yeah, and so, Adam, we can talk more about this later, but I think you're raising a really important point, and I just want to make sure that investors and others who are listening understand why we shared what we did today.
So first of all, you should expect that we will be using the earnings calls and other interactions that we have with you, and investors, and buy side, as things take place, and as we can share what our thinking is and our plans and actions, we're gonna be doing that real-time.
So, what I want to leave with you is this.
If you go back to the prior quarter and the -- what I call the bubble chart, which is the high-performing, low-performing, which we provide for the total company, and then you look at what we're providing today, which is like a next step forward.
So, we're showing you what that looks geographically.
We've also shown you within each region where we have high-performing and low-performing parts of the business.
The way I would encourage you and investors to think about all of that is those are, if you will, roadmaps, not specific to the degree I understand you would like to see, but they are roadmaps.
They are roadmaps in terms of the strong business that fits inside what, in the aggregate, is a somewhat mediocre business because of the low-performing elements that we still have.
But it's a roadmap in terms of where we're going to allocate more capital to.
It's also a roadmap, in general, of where we're gonna allocate capital from.
So, as you can imagine, that is a complex thing to do in terms of over the whole business.
We're gonna have to orchestrate this.
It will play out over time.
There are many constituencies that we're going to have to manage, because while those numbers that we gave you are large and substantial, they could be even larger if we don't manage this in the right way.
I mean, we'd like them to be smaller, so we're going to not, if you will, tip our hand before we need to so that we can manage this in the most efficient and effective way as possible.
"
3380,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,6,"No, I understand what you're saying, but let me just provide another -- yeah, a few other thoughts for you and others to think about.
So, one reason that we wanted to provide it is because we have been doing a lot of work in terms of how we're gonna redesign the business.
We clearly have a point of view, maybe not complete yet, because we still have a lot of more work to do, but we have a point of view about what that redesign is going to entail.
We're not providing the specifics for the reasons I mentioned, but it's clear that that redesign is going to be fundamental, and it's going to be deep, and it's going to really address these underperforming parts of the business.
"
3381,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,7,"The other thing I would remind you is we've been to the rodeo.
If you go back 10 years, a number of guys that are sitting around the table, and gals, went through an enormous restructuring with similar types of numbers, if not bigger, in the restructuring of North America.
And I was there on the day that Mark provided the first view of what The Way Forward plan was gonna be.
It was high level.
We talked about numbers of plants that we might close.
I actually looked at the details today.
It turned out some of those plants were different.
Some of the plants that we were gonna close we didn't, and some that we ultimately closed, we didn't think we were going to.
And the thing that's interesting about this, and this is another thing that's important for investors to understand, because everybody wants to have the answer today -- when we announced that in January of '06, the last two plants, which we didn't identify at that time that closed were in 2011, when we closed Twin Cities, which built the Ranger, and St.
Thomas in Canada, where we built the Crown Vic, the Grand Marquis, and the Town Car, because it was the right time to do that.
We were able to run them out, generate the cash flow, and manage that in the appropriate way.
That is exactly the same approach that we're going to take now.
"
3382,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,8,"Yeah, so let me respond to that.
So, the way that I would think about that, Ryan, and obviously we'll provide more as we can.
As I mentioned earlier in the Q&A with Adam, think about it this way.
We're showing you substantial parts of the business where we get extraordinary margins.
And we've told you that we're only going to allocate capital to new investment opportunities going forward that generate the appropriate returns on capital.
In the process, we will either move the low-performing parts of the business through fitness or other means in the lower left quadrant up, or we will dispose of them.
So, if you think about what that business looks like, it's gonna be a business that rocks.
It's gonna be a business that generates very strong operating margins, just as we do in North America, and very, very strong returns on invested capital.
It will look different.
It will be different, but it will be a much stronger business.
And that's exactly what's behind the restructuring charges that we've shared with you today as the -- if you will, the creation and the design of that new business.
"
3383,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,9,"So, let me answer the first part of the question, Ryan.
And that question is exactly why, really -- it's one of the reasons why we want to start disclosing China the way that we are, because of the significance of what goes on outside the joint ventures, which is all that we disclosed previously.
So, you're correct in your understanding that the JV is the $192 million decline that you see in the call-out box under the JV column.
We've put against that the royalties because they come from the JVs.
And you can see that they're giving us less on a year-over-year basis because of the volume decline.
So, when you think about the rest of the business and the consolidated business, think about it -- in normal situations, we would see a good return, a good profit coming from the Ford imports, and the major factor there would be the Explorer, which we've already announced we're gonna localize.
We have losses for Lincoln, no surprise, because we've just started over the last several years to establish it.
It's off to a good start.
We even grew in the first quarter again.
And that business model changes when we begin to localize, which starts in '19.
In fact, if anything, the business case is even stronger with the level of tariffs that we have today.
The piece that you don't see, and that's changed, and that should change in a positive way as we move forward is around what I call net engineering expense.
So, Ford Motor Company engineers for the joint ventures today, and we get compensation for that product when it comes to market and they start building it, let's say, three or four years from now.
So there's a lag between the two.
Jim has talked about the fact that we've got a big product onslaught that's under way, including BEVs, a much stronger lineup of SUVs, quite a number of products coming.
So, let me just give you a couple of things that will dimension this for you.
If you go back to the '15, '16, -- '14, '15, '16 period, the balance between the engineering that Ford incurred in the current year and the royalties that we were receiving from the joint ventures was pretty much balanced 50/50, so there was no net impact, if you will, on the bottom line because the expense was offset by the royalties.
In 2017, as we began this onslaught of engineering, if you will, for this big expansion of the portfolio, it started to tilt out of balance because we started to invest much more heavily in terms of engineering.
But that's for products and an expanded portfolio that comes in years ahead.
So, we started to tilt out of balance in terms of net expense, net engineering expense.
That net engineering expense this year, in an absolute sense, is about $600 million.
So, we've gone from balance to a negative net engineering expense of $600 million, and that's a $300 million increase on a year-over-year basis, which is part of the headwinds that we were facing.
That's not part of the guidance change because we had expected that, but that is definitely a major, major factor in terms of the absolutes that we're looking at.
As we move forward, and the engineering becomes more normalized, and we start to see the volumes grow coming from the expanded portfolio, our expectation is that we go back to a much more balanced position, which will be part of the improvement that takes place over time in the China consolidated business.
"
3384,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,10,"Yup.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.
"
3385,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,11,"Well, in terms of the funding, we are setting it up obviously as a separate legal entity.
We've done the same thing with Ford Smart Mobility, so there's optionality there.
And it is to allow for other partners or participants in the future.
We will be establishing a balance sheet, if you will, for them, but for now, it will be funded internally.
And I won't disclose any details around that.
"
3386,F,2018,2,robert-shanks,chief-financial-officer,True,12,"Well, what I expect it to do is basically to, if you will --we've got anchors.
We swim in the water with ankle weights, big ones.
And what we want to do is we want to get them off so that the real underlying strength of this company can come through.
And I can tell you, it's kind of interesting.
Again, I went back and looked at -- I actually kept all this stuff.
I'm not supposed to, because I think it's way past the time, but I kept all the files from back in 2005, 2006, and I was looking at the projections that we made of what would come out of what we called The Way Forward plan.
I mean, it paled in comparison versus what we actually delivered.
So ,the power of what this company can bring in terms of returns if it just invests in the right things in the right way and just releases the anchor weights that we historically have carried around with us for whatever reasons will be tremendously powerful.
"
3387,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,0,"Thanks, Lynn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to honor the contributions of Sergio Marchionne, a charismatic leader who deserves praise not only for his business accomplishments, but for his resolute discipline, demanding the most of himself and those around him, courage to speak plainly in the face of adversity, and an unwavering commitment to his values.
Our thoughts are with his family and colleagues, and may Sergio rest in eternal peace.
Now, please turn to slide two.
In April, we shared our framework to improve the competitiveness, profitability, and returns of our portfolio and to drive sustainable value creation.
This includes four smart choices for growth: a winning portfolio, commitment to new propulsion; investment in autonomous technology; and advancement of Ford's role in the mobility experience.
At the time, in filtering for value creation, we also put a spotlight on the divergence between the accretive and dilutive parts of our business.
We said we were going to feed the high performing parts and deal decisively with the areas that destroy value.
And we affirm that where we could raise returns of underperforming areas via fitness and/or alternative business models, we would, and we would disposition the rest.
Today, I want to provide an update on how we're moving swiftly to execute against that framework, including the AV and organizational changes we announced yesterday.
There's plans for restructuring that I will discuss in a moment, as well as an update on our near and longer-term targets.
Then I'm also going to touch on our underperformance in China and Europe.
So, back to the growth strategy.
Let me start with our commitment to cultivating a winning portfolio.
And if you would, turn to slide three.
Now, this graph, which is based on our 2017 results and is similar to what we showed you last quarter, shows our profitability be region.
It gives you a clear roadmap of where, from a geographic perspective, we have opportunities to redesign our business model.
Now, this redesign includes the reallocation of capital to opportunities with higher returns, restructuring, and strategic partnerships relative to restructuring, and mind you, we see this underneath that redesign.
We now believe we have the potential for about $11 billion of EBIT restructuring charges, with $7 billion of cash-related impacts over the next three to five years.
It's not surprise that North America, which is solidly in the upper right quadrant on that chart, accounts for all our company EBIT.
With returns of about 24%, the region earns well above our cost to capital, which is evidence of our earnings power when we focus our portfolio on where we can win.
And over time, North America's return profile should improve further, driven by fitness in our decision we talked about last call to no longer allocate capital to traditional sedan silhouettes.
So, these actions give us confidence in our target to return North America to 10% EBIT margin.
Notwithstanding this quarter, Europe and Asia-Pacific have been profitable, but with nagging low margins and ROIC below our targeted cost of capital.
South America was firmly in the lower left quadrant, with highly diluted margins and ROIC.
Middle East and Africa is in the same quadrant; however, this year, that team has done an excellent job on fitness, and the region now has a credible path to growth and improved returns.
Now, I'd like nothing better than to give you visibility and the specifics of how we may restructure.
But I want you to recognize, we're mindful of all of our stakeholders here -- the employees, dealers, unions, regulators, government officials, and investors.
Therefore, we only can share information publicly once decisions are made.
Now, we followed a similar approach last quarter when we announced our decision to exist sedan silhouettes in North America.
But our commitment is to keep you informed, and often.
When you have strong and weak franchises in regions, it's not as simple as just pulling the plug or exiting markets.
We know we can capitalize on our strengths -- we have a strong brand; bolster underperforming products in regions, and then, smartly and selectively disposition when we cannot make an appropriate return.
To do this well and with grounding in the future, it takes some time, more than the year I've been in this role.
As we mentioned in our earnings release, we have postponed our September analyst meeting.
Now, this was driven by the fact that we're in the midst of our global business redesign efforts; there's important partnership discussions that are taking place; and because of the uncertain policy environment that we're all in.
We plan to do two things.
First, we're gonna reconvene when we have concrete details to share.
But we're going to update you more certainly with touch points such as conferences, and one-on-one meetings, and daily interactions.
We plan to communicate frequently.
Now, let me turn back to the other smart choices for growth that I've been highlighting.
So, turn to slide four.
This is the area where we're starting with new propulsion choices.
We continue to stand by our global commitment to the Paris Accord 2°C stabilization glide path, and we're using this to guide our business.
For example, we're on track to add hybrid electrics to our high volume profitable vehicles like the F150.
Our battery electric vehicle rollout starts in 2020 with a performance utility, and we'll have 16 EVs in our portfolio by 2022.
Those 16 are all additions to our portfolio.
In the quarter, we had announced two new fuel-efficient taxis, hybrid and diesel, to give operators more choice and lower total cost of ownership.
We also introduced an all new lease interceptor utility hybrid.
People said it couldn't be done.
This is the industry's first pursuit-rated hybrid SUV, delivering improved performance at a lower cost.
Now the next area of growth is autonomous technologies.
So, coincidentally, we announced the reorganization of our autonomous vehicle efforts into a single effort under the Ford Smart Mobility umbrella.
This new Ford autonomous vehicles LLC will be led by CEO Sherif Marakby.
Sherif has had a long career at Ford, time at Uber, and it's an important step to provide our customers with trusted mobility services while creating long-term value for our stakeholders.
This new structure, which allows for third party investments, brings together the teams who have focused on our AV development for the past 18 months with a singular focus of commercial deployment of our AV business in 2021.
For your information, by 2023, we will have invested $4 billion into the development of our AV business, and this includes the billion we announced when we became a majority stakeholder in Argo AI.
By creating this AV LLC now, we can leverage the incredible strides our development teams have already made and streamline future decision-making, and better capitalize on the market opportunities.
In the mobility segment of our growth strategy, we expanded the scope of our strategic partnerships with a new memorandum of understanding with Zotye to establish a JV to provide smart, customized all electrical vehicle solutions in China's fastest-growing ride-hailing market.
We also signed a letter of intent with Baidu in China to jointly explore areas of cooperation and connectivity, artificial intelligence, and digital marketing.
And Ford Commercial Solutions introduced two new connected vehicle products to provide fleet managers and telematic service providers direct access to valuable OEM-grade vehicle data.
This is the power of the APIs, to allow them to better manage their fleets.
Let me go back for a moment to the winning portfolio.
Candidly, we're extremely dissatisfied with our performance in Europe and China, and we had not planned for these types of results.
For each region, we've identified root causes.
This is why I mentioned with the winning portfolio, we see issues there.
And we know how to do this -- the actions required to get these businesses back on track.
In fact, today, I've invited Jim Farley to take you through a deeper dive on this before we go into Q&A.
Let me return to the announcements we made yesterday and touch on four key management changes that we announced, along with the new AV LLC.
As I mentioned, Sherif Marakby is the CEO of that.
He will report directly to Marcy Klevorn.
And Marcy had a rich history at Ford, building the software stack as our Chief Information Officer.
I'm really happy that Marcy will now focus execution with this group.
Joe Hinrichs will now have responsibility for IT and our global order-to-delivery system.
In support of the fitness initiative, this realignment will help us accelerate the integration and application of technology across the industrial system to further streamline manufacturing, adopt big data, speed vehicle delivery times, reduce inventories, and improve capital efficiency.
Joe's had roles not only in setting up new businesses around the world running North America, but also was part and parcel to these important negotiations 10 years ago that helped save the company.
He's got a great view of the business end-to-end, and this is an important assignment.
Under Jim Farley's leadership, we're now embedding a deeper product line focus across the company, which will allow global product line teams to put greater emphasis on customer insights and market opportunities, delivering more user-driven products and services.
This approach builds on the success we've already experienced with our F-Series teams in North America, the Ranger team in Asia Pacific; and we've copied it with the commercial vehicle team in Europe.
We're also subtly making a linkage between the market leadership and the product leadership here.
And Hau Thai-Tang, Executive Vice President of Product Development and Purchasing, will now report directly to me.
This move ensures that these critical functions have an even stronger voice at our leadership table as we execute on fitness, and we create the winning portfolio around the world.
Okay.
Turn to slide six for me, please.
And before I turn it over to Bob, let me say that I am confident in our plans to create a winning portfolio and execute on our other growth drivers, including AV.
I mean, North America, Ford Credit -- the quarter they just had shouldn't be lost in our news today.
They had very solid quarters.
And while Europe and China are notably challenged, we're moving swiftly to stem the negative tide in both of those businesses.
We've been working on this.
We have line of sight to about $11 billion in restructuring with cash-related effects of $7 billion over the next three to five years, which we believe will provide substantial benefits from both a growth and a profitability and return perspective.
Now, due largely to the performance in Europe and China, today we're lowering our 2018 EPS guidance range to $1.30 to $1.50.
I'll say it again: $1.30 to $1.50, despite better than expected performance from Ford Credit and North America.
I'm gonna get asked this question, so let me say, looking further out, we are still targeting the 8% EBIT margin and high teens ROIC by 2020.
So, let me at this point turn it over to Bob for more detail.
"
3388,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,1,"Yeah, hi, Adam, Jim Hackett.
"
3389,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,2,"It is the center of gravity.
And so, the company -- yeah, the company has addressed that.
and it's an important thing.
In fact, it's so important, it's the kind of thing I discuss with the board quarterly.
just so that everyone's on the same page about how important these people are to us.
"
3390,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,3,"Appreciate the question.
Operator
Okay.
We will now take our last question from Mr.
Brian Johnson with Barclays.
"
3391,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,4,"Well, there's a huge commitment to that.
I mean, the way the company thinks about this, we think about it in time phases of now, near, and far, and each one of them gets attention.
I think that from a now perspective, we really know our business.
We know where profit's coming from, where the challenges come from.
I think when you stare at the China problem, we're taking full responsibility for what we would do differently with that.
And it does go back to the things we've been saying, is that there was some what I would call weak signals that became profound about the product acceptance in China, Ford products and the aging.
There were some things about the partnerships that needed to be tuned up.
We are a new team, and we're committed to these folks and our dealers.
So, I'm confident.
This is why I said this in my comments, that the things, Brian, that you wonder slipped away here, we actually know how to do.
We've got really good people and know how to fix this.
There is a sense, I just want to show you the humility of this -- China is a really competitive market, hypercompetitive, 20 to 30 competitors that we didn't have a decade ago that are indigenous.
So, but I love a challenge like this.
I think that our ability to understand customers and use and translate that into product is gonna be one of the big pillars of our recovery.
As you think about, though, the questions all the way through that time phase of just what we're working on now, you can't forget the future.
And in the middle of this, we've all been dealing in industry and business with trade and shifts in that regard.
I'm really confident.
The team's been great at dealing with that.
If you think about North America, we had all the effects, because we have supply at a higher percentage from North American steel than any of our competitors; same with aluminum.
And here we are recording the kind of margins that we're seeing today.
So, I'm really happy with the unexpected events.
A fire hits the company, and it's amazing, amazing what the people at Ford did to turn that around.
And you see the extent of what it could have done to damage our business, and we think we're gonna actually recover by the end of the year there.
So, this is just an endorsement that these kinds of things aren't hard for us to manage.
And I'm confident that I really believe in everybody here and our ability to address all these things.
"
3392,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,5,"Well, I mean, you've had a long day in that regard, right, in terms of as you stare at the industry.
So, I think the headwinds relative to some of these unexpected things are why we've got to have confidence that this isn't being upended by trade, and tariffs, and things like that.
I'll just make a statement that -- I've said this before, the trade structures always have existed.
And the best times that you can see business perform inside trade is when there's equilibrium.
And forget for a moment who's winning and who's losing.
Just think about, you design your business to the certainty of that.
So, all of us are learning how to kind of deal with that unexpected nature.
And who can speculate how long the uncertainty will stand? But we're ready to deal with it.
I think when you think of Brexit, for example, it's probably lost in our reporting how profitable the UK normally is for us.
And I'm reading about other aerospace companies who want to have you still waiting to see the evolution of that trade structure so they can make decisions.
What we're telling you today with the forecast of the charges for restructuring, we're going ahead and starting to deal with the effects of all these things in a way that we get more control of our future.
"
3393,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,6,"Thank you.
Lynn, so I'd like to just make some closing comments.
Thank you, everyone, for joining us again today.
We're committed, as you've heard over and over, that we're taking appropriate and decisive action to drive profitable growth, maximize returns of our business over the long-term.
We're through this process of identifying opportunities by region to redesign our business model.
We are actively reallocating capital to areas where we can generate the higher returns, including understanding restructuring and strategic partnerships.
Remember, we've announced a few of these.
There is a sense of urgency in the company.
We're committed to this EBIT margin target of 8%, the high teens ROIC in 2020.
And we realize that the China and Europe performance need to be clearer to you and to us in terms of a positive future.
So, thank you for following Ford, and thank you for joining us today.

3394,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,7,
3395,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,8,"No, we're not going beyond that tonight.
"
3396,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,9,"Yeah, thank you, Adam.
It's a straightforward.
I love the job that I have.
We're making tremendous progress.
I get to -- look, this is a year ago that we had our first quarterly call, and I look back on what we said we would do.
We've made tremendous progress.
We've made a number of decisions.
In fact, a few are worth emphasizing.
One is this product portfolio turnaround, all the work.
Of course, as you know, in the industry, Adam, these are decisions that will fuel growth and profits in the future.
I'm not blaming anyone in the rearview mirror, but I had nothing to do with the portfolio that we're now kind of laboring under in a couple markets.
And we've taken really decisive action to address all of that.
The second thing is, the fitness initiatives, which we introduced, kind of an abstract word, everyone wasn't sure what it meant, we now have earmarked over $11 billion of value.
We've started to work on our longer-term planning, and we're expecting more to come from that.
So, it's had more traction than I first forecasted.
The third thing is, is this team has really come together.
I feel like in any kind of endeavor I've been in, it takes time for a group of people to come together and work closely.
You heard with these management choices.
I'm really proud of the group that I have on -- side by side with me.
And hell yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we're going and what we want to get done.
So, I think there should be zero question about that.
"
3397,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,10,"Yeah.
"
3398,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,11,"Let's let Jim Farley take that part first, because I'm gonna have Bob come back to the way the accounting is coming through.
Jim?
"
3399,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,12,"Jim?
"
3400,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,13,"Dave, this is Jim Hackett.
Let me confirm that setting this up does a number of things for us.
If you look at slide 38, it's on the right.
This is the part you probably wouldn't see if you were peering into Ford, where all the capabilities that we've been in the middle of managing, we now tie that together.
And then the monetization on the other side, which is the promise of this whole business, which many of you have written about.
This is expanding in terms of interest.
Lots of people, of course, in other parts of our industry have received capital.
So, we've had people approach us.
We're not disclosing any of that tonight, but yeah, we've had interest.
And I would just suggest to you a couple things.
One, there's not gonna be 10 winners in this space when we look back.
There's gonna be a few, and we plan on being one of them.
And we can look at the computer industry in a similar evolutionary way to see what happened as it took off.
Two, the Argo AI team, we just met with Bryan today, is really making progress.
In fact, the velocity of the way the vehicle learns -- you've got to think about the compounding that you know about from miles driven -- the velocity of its learning is faster than some of the chip capabilities that we contract for, which, said another way, is we're already advancing the neural network learning of the system beyond what people thought it might do, which is great, because that's what it has to have in order to be safe and deployable.
The third thing is that we've committed in our plan $3 billion of additional dollars.
But that's a fair question to ask, if there's more.
And Bob, I'm gonna let you address that.
"
3401,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,14,"And that's why I want to sneak in to Adam and Ryan and all of your questions about how long have those weights been on those ankles? And so, this is a credit to the team.
In a very short time, we're making decisions, planning.
We're gonna do this very thoughtfully, but with dispatch.
And so, I'm really proud of that and I'm a little mystified why that doesn't come through, because this -- in previous calls, this was the question.
Are you really going to be candid, Jim, and take a deep look at things, and how quickly will you come to conclusions, and what actions will you take? I do understand, and it's fair that you want to know what kind of returns these bring in, so we plan to update you on that.
But I think this hard work has really happened, and so I'm happy where we stand tonight with what we know.
"
3402,F,2018,2,james-hackett,president-and-chief-executive-officer-,False,15,"And I would add to that, Bryan -- or John, that the fitness initiatives, which we talked about, we've identified 19 of these.
Those have come in richer than we originally projected.
And so, I'm gonna assert here that as you stare at the volume as you do and you start looking at the profit performance of the business, it's still realizing lots of value that comes from these fitness initiatives.
"
3403,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,0,"I'm Takeuchi.
How do you do?
Noriko Okamoto
I'd like to call Mr.
Kuraishi to present the first-quarter financial results, please.
"
3404,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,1,"Let me begin.
First, the FY '22 first quarter three months financial results.
Regarding Honda Group unit sales, motorcycles increased in Indonesia, India, among others, automobiles dropped in China, while increased in the United States.
Life Creation increased in the United States.
Next, income statement.
Due to increase across the board in all business segments, sales revenue increased from the same quarter last year to JPY 3,583.8 billion.
Operating profit was JPY 243.2 billion due to increased sales revenue and model mix.
And share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method was JPY 55.9 billion due to profit increase in Japan and Indonesia.
And next is a change in profit before income taxes.
Profit before income taxes in the first quarter was JPY 311.3 billion, up JPY 384.7 billion from the same quarter last year.
Due to profit increase attributable to increased sales revenue and model mix as well as currency effect, operating profit reached JPY 243.2 billion, up JPY 356.9 billion from the same quarter last year.
Moving on to results by business segment.

Both combined, operating profit is estimated to be JPY 159.2 billion.
Automobile business due to profit increase attributable to increased sales revenue and model mix, operating profit was JPY 70.6 billion.
Financial Services business, due to increase in used vehicle prices, among others, operating profit reached JPY 92.2 billion.
Life Creation business and others.
Operating loss was JPY 300 million, of which aircraft and aircraft engines operating loss was JPY 8.3 billion.
The next is cash flows in the nonfinancial services in FY '22 first quarter.
Due to temporary increase in inventory, cash flow was minus JPY 99.5 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter was JPY 2,297.8 billion.
Moving on to FY '22 consolidated financial forecast.
First, Honda Group unit sales.
Motorcycles, due to the resurge in COVID-19 infection in mainly Asia, we are forecasting unit sales to be 17.4 million units.
Automobiles.
Given the resurge in COVID-19 infection, we reviewed our semiconductor supply plan and the FY '22 forecast is now 4,850,000 units.
Life Creation mainly expected to increase by 400,000 units in Europe and North America, our revised forecast is 6.3 million units.
Next, FY 2022 consolidated financial forecast is as shown.
And change in profit before tax.
Profit before tax is JPY 1,000 billion up JPY 85.8 billion from last fiscal year.
Operating profit, despite the provision for credit losses and SG&A increase, thanks to profit increase attributable to increased sales revenue and model mix.
Operating profit is up JPY 119.7 billion.
Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method due to [Inaudible] related companies in the last fiscal year, resulting in a onetime impact of JPY 56.8 billion.
Profit is down JPY 52.7 billion.
Compared to the forecast announced last in May, despite profit drop attributable to declining unit sales, which is resulting in change in sales revenue and model mix, due to further cost reduction, cost control efforts and currency effects, profit before tax is forecasted to be up JPY 130 billion.
Lastly, FY '22 forecast, capital expenditure, depreciation and R&D is as shown.
And this concludes my presentation.
Thank you.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you very much for your attention.
So now I would like to move on to the questions and answers as part of the presentation today.
We have already announced via Zoom invitations for those in the media.
[Operator instructions] Thank you for your cooperation.
So first question from NHK [Inaudible].
Unknown speaker
I have two questions.
One is the semiconductor shortages plus in South-Asian countries, the pandemic is resurging again, that's a concern.
But after the second quarter onwards, what is the perspective of the regular production plans? And second question, and so when do you think the shortage of the semiconductor components programs continue.
In the long run, what is the prospect on those shortage of the parts components of the semiconductors?
"
3405,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,2,"Well, cost reduction covers a lot of things, but two, three years ago as a company, we have been trying to reduce costs in all areas possible in daily production activities.
So we have tried to make efficient production.
In the first quarter also, we have seen an improvement.
And therefore, we will continue to have this impact of the cost reduction going into the second quarter after.
And I think it's an accumulation of small efforts that we are seeing a big result.
Unknown speaker
What specifically are you doing to reduce the costs? Which costs are going down? And about the unit sales, I believe that the unit sales is expected to drop, but the profit as sales revenue is expected to increase as for the cost reduction.
"
3406,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,3,"Well, according to our current cost structure, we are purchasing about 80% of covenants outside -- from outside.
And 20% is made in-house.
But we want to make efficient production, and therefore, we are examining what needs to be changed to -- and also how we can reduce our cost to produce the same number of units.
We are looking into the cycle time, how to reduce the cycle time and the man hours, et cetera.
So it's accumulation of all these small efforts that we are seeing a reduction in our cost.
Operator
Next one from Mr.
[Inaudible.
Unknown speaker
[Inaudible] from newspaper.
So semiconductor shortage.
So impact on the unit sales is as much as 150,000.
However, operating profit and also the sales revenues.
How much impact on those two sales and operating profit because of the semiconductor shortage.
And I know that the future is uncertain in that regards still.
But by the end of this fiscal year, what is your perspective of impact -- negative impact by the shortage of the semiconductor? How much impact do you expect for that? And also the raw materials cost increase, including the semiconductors, its impact, how much impact do you expect for this fiscal year? And any counter-measures for that, please?
"
3407,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,4,"And I'll talk about this sales revenue for the automobiles, 150,000.
That's the impact.
And as of which 90,000 impacted on the OP list, that includes 60,000 for China.
And volume mix is -- volume mix area.
That is including those impact.
And our expectation is at 400.
That's the impact on that.
And in the beginning of the fiscal year as compared to the last one, the raw materials such as the precious metals are soaring -- price is going up about JPY 250 billion.
Cost increase now is included in the expectations for this year for the raw materials cost increase.
Precious metal increase of the prices actually are a little lower than the total situation of that.
Aluminum, the steel, platinum, there's expected cost increase of those and offsetting with that JPY 250 million upward change up-rate will be expected for that.
Operator
[Inaudible] please?
Unknown speaker
[Inaudible] newspaper.
I have two questions.
The first about the U.S.
Well, the incentives are going down.
And I think this is resulting in good, better results.
But in the first quarter and FY '22, do you have any specific numbers about the incentives? And about China.
In the first quarter, I think that the retail volume unit sales is increasing.
But yesterday, the Wuhan factory operation was suspended.
And well, in Asia, you are seeing this.
But what about the outlook for just China only for this fiscal year?
"
3408,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,5,"Yes.
Allow me to explain about the incentives.
Well, yes, in the first quarter, the incentives on a cash basis.
Well, in auto data, it includes the dealers incentives so -- but looking at the incentives as we define it in the first quarter, I think it was much lower than the previous year.
And therefore, I think it's very low, the incentives, but still, the incentives toward the inventory because of the accounting, they have to adjust the inventory and also keep down the incentives.
And therefore, this fiscal year, the outlook compared to last year, I think it's about -- the incentive is about 10% lower than the previous year.
Operator
[Inaudible] newspaper, Mr.
[Inaudible].
Unknown speaker
[Inaudible] from [Inaudible] newspaper.
Two questions.
One is the semiconductor shortage was being touched upon in the first quarter.
How many are units of the production is impacted by the semiconductor shortage in the first quarter? And then you may not be able to tell, but how long would that situation continue? That's the question one.
And second question in the Southeast Asian countries, lockdown maybe posing impact and what is going on at the dealers, distributors over there? What is going on because of the lockdown in Southeast Asian countries?
"
3409,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,6,"OK.
The operating profit for automobiles, as you said earlier, last year, our operating profit margin that was 3.1% at Honda and high now because of the North American markets and other areas will be more numbers of volume sold.
And also there were negative impact as well because of the soaring raw materials and also the cost reduction efforts and also the price -- excuse me, the commercial value of the vehicles that also is impacting, and also I think mainly these are because of the unit sales, the volume number going up and that is impacting on that number, plus because reduction efforts being carried, finally.
And then as for the European businesses, electrification businesses.
In Europe, by 2022, we would like to make main products 100% electrified and that is planned and now.
And when we say EVs, that includes HEV as well.
Therefore because of the announcement recently, actually, we need to look into the specific parts of that.
Now specifically with regard to what they want to do with the environmental issues.
However, in 2050, we are trying to achieve carbon neutrality.
However, in response to the announcement recently, we'd like to accelerate our electrification activities for our product.
Thank you.
Operator
Next question will be the last question.
Last question is Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun newspaper, [Inaudible].
Unknown speaker
My name is [Inaudible] from Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun newspaper.
Well, you have been talking about the semiconductor shortage and also the lockdown and the pandemic spread in Southeast Asia.
But in the mid- to long run, you have been making various efforts like cost reduction and supply chain review.
So do you have any plans that you can disclose for the mid- to long term? And the second question about capital investment.
Well, you say that there is no major change.
But due to the external environmental changes, is there anything that you might change in terms of the substance of capital investment? Though demand is the same.
"
3410,HMC,2022,1,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,7,"Yes.
And the capital investment, it does include a number of things.
And there are the renewal of existing equipment and new equipment and the external environment has been changing, and thought the amount remains the same.
If we have to accelerate our electrification efforts, I think what, we'll be investing and will change.
But currently, we have nothing that we can announce here today.
Thank you.

Director, senior managing director, Kohei Takeuchi.
"
3413,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,1,"So let me explain the first-quarter results of FY 2022 as well as the summary of the full year outlook.
First regarding the unit sales of Honda Group in the first quarter of FY 2022, the volume sales outperformed year on year in all business segments due to the recovery of the demands from the last year, which had a large impact by COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, our motorcycle businesses, 3.879 million units sold; automobile businesses, 998,000 units; and Life Creation business 1.708 million units were sold.
I'll explain about the main market situations next.
The total market in Japan has outperformed the same period last year because the demand recovered from the last year decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Honda, too, had impacted by semiconductor supply shortage and so on.
However, we outperformed last year unit sales with the effective launch of the new Vezel launched in April.
M-Series had reached three million cumulative unit sales in Japan since its launch.
The total market in FY 2022 still remains uncertain going forward due to concerns of resurging COVID-19.
Honda revised the forecast from last time.
Taking advantage of the new Vezel and new model Civic, that will be launched in this autumn.
We will aim to maximize the unit sales.
Total market in the U.S.
has surpassed the level same period last year, thanks to increasing vaccine for COVID-19 and effective economic stimulus measures, which really have recovered demand.
Light truck models propelled all business in Honda, which have updated the monthly sales record in three months consecutively, exceeding the market growth.
New model Civic launched in June, is receiving favorable acceptance by customers.
We expect the total market by FY 2022 to achieve solid demand.
However, impact of semiconductor supply shortage and so on still will remain.
Honda has revised the last forecast, though we will endeavor to minimize the impact of supply shortage of the chips and to catch up with the production.
The total market in China has seen the demand recovery owing to the effective measures for economic stimulation by the government.
However, the market underperformed year on year due to the impact of the semiconductor supply shortage and so on.
In spite of such supply shortage of chips, Honda achieved better than the market growth with the incremental sales of our XR-V and so on.
Regarding the total market of calendar 2022, we expect the demand to stay steady with the residual impact of semiconductor shortages.
Honda has revised the last forecast.
We will plan to expand our unit sales by new model launch and EV lineup improvements with our Breeze PHEV premiered in Shanghai motor show in April.
Moving on to the motorcycle business.
The total market has outperformed year on year with once dropped demand due to the COVID-19, now are up, recovered.
Honda has performed better year on year in all of the markets.
However, in India and in Malaysia, we suspended the production activities for a while because of the resurging pandemic.
Speaking of the total market of FY 2022.
Because of the COVID-19 infections rising up again, mainly in Asia, the future is uncertain.
Honda have revised the last forecast, mainly for India.
Next, summary of the financial results of the first-quarter FY 2022.
Despite impact by supply shortage of semiconductors storing the raw material prices and so on as compared to the significant impact by the COVID-19 in the same period last year, our unit sales increased.
And as the initiatives we have pursued to solidify the existing businesses being affected, the operating profit has increased by JPY 356.9 billion to JPY 243.2 billion.
The profit for the period attributable to the owners of the parent for the first quarter increased by JPY 303.3 billion, JPY 222.5 billion with incremental investment profit from the equity.
This slide shows the sales units as well as the P&Ls.
Next, with regard to the FY 2022 outlook.
We plan to increase both sales revenues and the profits of our FY 2021 results based on the increase in sales units and effective initiatives to solidify existing business and so on.
From the last year forecast, unit sales are revised reflecting the latest semiconductor supply plans in addition to the impact of COVID-19 resurgence, mainly in Asia.
Those impacts will be absorbed by additional suppression of SG&A, cost reduction effects and so on, and we revised the operating profit guidance to add JPY 120 billion to hit JPY 780 billion.
Regarding the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the parent with incremental operating profit and so on, we up-revised the guidance to add JPY 80 billion to hit JPY 670 billion.
This slide shows the unit sales and P&Ls.
Speaking of the dividends and the share buybacks.
Annual dividend for FY 2022 stands the same as we announced last time.
In the Board of Directors meeting convened today, we made a decision for share buybacks.
For the purpose of improved capital efficiency, execution of the flexible capital strategies and so on, we plan to buy back our common stocks up to 18 million shares or the maximum sum of JPY 70 billion of the acquisition prices for the acquisition period between August 5 and December 31, 2021.
Next, Mr.
Takeuchi will present to you the details of the results.
"
3414,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,2,"Thank you for your question.
So after the second quarter onwards, our prospect is, for instance, based on the first-quarter results, in the market, thanks to the vaccinations progress and also the government economic stimulus measures, thanks to those things, but from some areas or regions, and of course, the impact of the COVID-19 last year was quite significant.
Basically, the sales itself has grown quite significantly.
The market is good.
And the semiconductor situation going forward and COVID-19 still unclear, uncertain going forward in both terms.
However, the sales is going to stay steady going forward.
That's our prospect.
And in terms of those parts influence or impact, in the beginning of the fiscal year, when we had the announcement, we talked about our progress of FY 2022.
With the unclear semiconductor supplies, we had thought that there could be a impact on the 100,000 unit production.
However, in the second half, we said that we will try to catch up with the production as much as we can, looking at the situations in order to minimize the impact on our production.
So when we put together our budget, we did not include the impact by the semiconductor shortages.
We state our unit sales perspective to five million instead of the time in the beginning of the year.
But globally, we tried to minimize them.
However, in the first-quarter period, the situation is contained within our expectations.
However, [Inaudible] recovery is a little bit slow and also in Asia, lockdown of the cities going on.
Because of that, based on the latest business situations, we put up those full year forecast.
The latest one now is down revised to 4.85 million units, 150,000 less.
And of course, the VOIs, the virus is of concerns and semiconductor shortages.
There are many factors impacting on the businesses going forward, still uncertain, I should say.
However, we will watch out the market situations, and we will try to hit better than the last year unit sales this year.
And in order to have a stable part supplies, we are speaking to the several companies and suppliers and sites, so that we can get supplies for more than one places.
And also we will try to keep appropriate level of the stocks inventories for different parts of component.
So the impact on the production is minimized.
But in the long run, we need to commonize those parts and components and generalize the use of those parts and more stable supplies by multiple suppliers.
But of course, we cannot avoid impact by the lockdown.
As of now, in Asian countries, there are some lockdown situations for the pandemic in several places.
Because of that, the production is squeezed.
And in other words, we can use -- divert those components and parts, which are not needed in those lockdown sites to other countries like China or Japan.
This is where we can adjust the production situations globally is where we can try to minimize the impact on the manufacturing status.
Thank you very much for your question.

Next is from [Inaudible] newspaper.
Unknown speaker
I am from [Inaudible] newspaper.
I have two questions.
First, for this quarter, China compared to the United States, the domestic unit sales seems to be low.
And this is -- is this due to the shortage of semiconductors or are there any other reasons for this? Can you give an explanation for the reason? The second, about the forecast.
About the motorcycle unit sales, it's down and yet your profit forecast is up.
So can you explain this? And the cost reduction or cost reduction efforts, I think that you're expecting more effect.
But can you explain what specific effects you are anticipating for this cost reduction effort?
"
3415,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,3,"[Inaudible] thank you very much.
Well, first, about the domestic sales.
The domestic sales, the economic activities are recovering and the demand compared to last year when we had the severe impact of the pandemic, I think it is recovering to what we have seen before the pandemic.
Meanwhile, I talked about Honda.
Due to the shortage of semiconductors and there's a drop in production volume.
And especially for us in the global market, in our global business, we are allocating semiconductors here in Japan.
For the April, May impact for us was big, Meanwhile, other companies, the April-May impact was not that big.
And because of this, for the first quarter, especially, Honda appears to be low in volume.
But in July.
Other companies are starting to suffer from the shortage.
And therefore, the new Vezel, mainly and the M-series and the demand is very strong.
And we believe that in the second half and once the supply of semiconductors recover, we can achieve the unit sales equal to other competitors and much better than last year.
And about the forecast and the reason why we are forecasting a drop in unit sales, as I've already explained in our budget, originally, we did not include the impact of the semiconductor shortage.
But this time, due to a number of new factors, we had to review the unit sales.
Especially in the second half, we were planning to offset and recover, but from the second quarter onwards.
So we believe that there will be greater impact than we expected in terms of the unit sales.
And depending on the region, we have to produce overcapacity.
And therefore, we believe that it's difficult to recover by the end of this fiscal year, and this has been factored in this time.
As for the motorcycles, I think it's mostly India.
But again, in the first quarter, including the lockdown, due to the spread of the coronavirus infection, there was a drop.
But now in July, India, the pandemic situation has improved significantly.
And currently, though there was a drop, we are expecting to increase sales, and that is what we are forecasting for now.
The cost reduction effect, Yes, Mr.
Takeuchi will respond.
"
3416,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,4,"Thank you for question.
So the expectation of the semiconductor shortage impact 4.85 million units that we announced this year actually is the number based on the adjustment with semiconductor suppliers as of now, and that is the number that we adjusted and now understand that this will be as many as we can, of course, do.
Of course, for the COVID-19 and it is not controllable.
Therefore, we cannot say much in that end.
However, as I said, the global production adjustment will be done, so that we will keep our target of 4.85 million EBIT production for the year.
"
3417,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,5,"Let me respond in regards to your question regarding China.
About China we are seeing that the new models are being introduced.
And we believe, overall, as a market, the business will be better than last fiscal year, the results will be better than last year.
But I said because of the components shortage and also the various uncertainty related to this industry, we have to pay attention to these developments.
As for Honda, there is this impact of the semiconductor shortage but the new models and also the lineup -- strengthening our lineup of EVs and others, we think that because our brand and also models have been well received.
And I think that in the first quarter, it has been a record high.
We want to enhance the strength of our brand and also expand the lineup of our EV cars and Honda Connect will be evolved so that we will be providing products which are filled with fun features.
As for Wuhan, from August 3, the factory has suspended operation.
But this is because of the development area where our factory's located, there was a cluster at the supplier there.
And therefore, we had to suspend the operation.
And we are consulting with the local government at Wuhan.
And we don't think that this will continue for a long time.
And as for our impact, we already, we have the shortage of semiconductors.
We have to adjust the production even without this.
And well, we don't know how long this situation will continue, but we believe that in principle the impact will not be that big and we are targeting toward sales more than last year.
So our target remains the same.
About the incentive, please?
"
3418,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,6,"So the impact on the production first quarter, about 170,000 to 180,000 units of production impacted by the semiconductor supply shortage in the first quarter.
But until when will that continue, we'll try to catch up in the second half as we have produced 150,000 in the first place.
And in the second quarter, I think, we thought the impact will be resolved.
But in the second quarter, first, however, because of the pandemic in Asian countries and also dealers there plus production's lost in some places and those impact is actually being carried over to the same quarter.
And in the second half, in principle, I believe, we can catch up with that.
We can recover that in the second quarter.
And the impact of the lockdown in South-East Asian countries.
At the moment, large impact is seen in Indonesia, in Thailand and in Vietnam and in Malaysia.
And dealers of course, have different situations in place -- different areas.
I wouldn't say all of the dealer distribution activities are stopped.
That is really variable from one place to another.
Basically, those dealers are still active by selling the products as usual.
Operator
Automotive News, Mr.
Hans, please?
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the inventory situation in the United States.
It must be very tight.
The numbers say it's very tight compared to last year.
How is that impacting incentives? Are you able to lower incentives because you have such low inventory? And what adjustments are you making to make sure that you can get more cars to dealers to increase those inventory levels.
In other words, how are you trying to boost inventories in new ways.
Operator
[Foreign language]
"
3419,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,7,"Well, first about the inventory situation.
Well, the industry on the whole, the inventory level is quite low.
And regarding Honda as well and because of the shortage of components, mainly in semiconductor has a impact on our production.
And in regards of Honda, the industry average is 25 days.
Honda is currently 23 days, I understand.
And therefore, compared to the normal situation, there is a very low level of inventory.
And given this tight inventory situation, the cars which are due to be delivered to the dealers, we are trying to increase the inventory cycle and make it faster so that we can deliver more.
Well, the United States, the people -- well, they buy it and they take home the car with them on that very day.
So we need to deliver these new cars to the dealers as early as possible.
But through digitization and other efficiency measures, we have been doing this in the past as well.
But using these new methods, we want to try to adjust the inventory.
But in regards to the United States, I'm thinking about the business style there.
Unless there's an inventory at the dealers, there will be a very tough situation.
Then normally, we will try to reduce the inventory.
And including the online sales, we have to think about how we can try to sell despite tight inventory.
About the incentives, let's begin with Honda, our incentive is low.
And the average of the industry is 2,700 and our average is 2,100.
So in regards to Honda, I don't think that there has been such a significant drop in incentives.
But depending on the product, there are some differences

Next question [Inaudible].
Unknown speaker
I have two questions.
One is about the automobile business operating profit.
In the first quarter, 3.1%.
Last year, full year basis, it was 1%, therefore, it's an improvement and what are the factors behind for that improvement? And question 2 is about European businesses.
European commission said that by 2030, where Hybrid, as those cars -- of those types are banned.
And what's the plan for that Swindon plant.
And what is your positioning of our European businesses, to say, and if we have any plans for the European businesses going forward, please share with me.
"
3420,HMC,2022,1,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president",False,8,"About the supply chain.
As I earlier mentioned, in the long run, in order to have a stable supply, stable procurement, we need to have more sources of semiconductors and consider how we should be holding our inventory.
So there are a number of things that we are currently studying.
And the supply chain review needs to be done, I think, as a result of all these factors.
And about the capital investment?

This is Kamiyama from Asahi newspaper.
Yes.
I have two questions as well.
My first question is about the semiconductor shortage.
The impact of that to production.
So from April to December so far, I just want to know how much of a production decrease has happened because of the semiconductor.
And then for the January and March, I think you said that you will try to recover this for production.
So I'd like to ask for your prospects for procuring semiconductors.
And then the last financial results briefing, you said that you will try to use the semiconductors in major markets like states in China.
If there are any further new actions that you're doing to recover this, please let us know.
That's my first question.
My second question is about the surging raw material prices.
So what are you doing against that? So overseas manufacturers, they -- some of them, they are raising the vehicle prices to be sold in Japan due to the material prices hike.
I wonder if you're ever considering it.
I don't think that's ever happened in Japan so far, but I'm just wondering what will be the difficulty if you ever try to raise your product prices in Japan? Thank you.

[Foreign language] Then, Mr.
Kuraishi, you will first present the third quarter financial results.
Over to you, Mr.
Kuraishi.
"
3425,HMC,2022,3,kohei-takeuchi,director-and-senior-managing-executive-officer,False,1,"[Foreign language] And I'd like to begin the explanation.
First, under group unit sales for FY '22 9 months was motorcycles due to increase in mainly Asia, unit sales increased to 2,775,000 units.
Automobiles, due to decline in China and North America was unit sales was 3 million units.
Life creation due to increase in mainly North America and Europe was 4.5 million units.
And next, FY '22, three quarters, nine months change in profit before income taxes.
Profit before income taxes was JPY 845.2 billion, up JPY 186.5 billion from the same period last fiscal year.
Operating profit was JPY 671.6 billion, up JPY 224.6 billion from the same period last fiscal year.
Operating profit, excluding currency translation effect was JPY 97.7 billion.
Breakdown was revenue model mix, etc., despite the drop in automobile unit sales due to the effect of controlling incentives and others was plus JPY 81.4 billion.
Regarding cost reduction, etc., despite the impact of the certain raw material costs due to cost reduction and price increase effects was minus JPY 9.7 billion.
SG&A was plus JPY 98 billion due to cost reduction effect, such as warranty expenses.
And next, sales revenue, operating profit by business segment.
Motorcycle business operating profit was JPY 282.3 billion.
Automobile business operating profit was JPY 188.5 billion.
Financial services business operating profit was JPY 258.1 billion.
Combined operating profit of automobile business and financial services for automobiles was JPY 437.2 billion.
And next slide, creation and other businesses.
Operating loss was JPY 7.4 billion, of which aircraft and aircraft engine operating loss was JPY 23.6 billion.
Moving on to cash flows.
FY '22 in nine months free cash flow of nonfinancial services business was JPY 178.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period was JPY 2.416.8 billion.
And moving on to FY '22 consolidated forecast.
Honda group unit sales.
Motorcycles forecast is revised downward from the last forecast to JPY 17.04 million reflecting drop in mainly Asia.
Automotive business, despite shortage in semiconductor supply and research of COVID-19 infections, the rebid forecast remains unchanged, i.e., 4.2 million units.
Life creation business, reflecting mainly the drop in North America, we are forecasting 5.95 million units.
Let me proceed to explain FY '22 forecast change in profit before income taxes compared to the previous forecast.
Profit before income taxes is forecasted to be JPY 1.020 billion, up JPY 160 billion from the previous forecast.
Operating profit is forecast to be JPY 800 billion, up JPY 140 billion from the previous forecast.
Operating profit, excluding currency effects, as plus JPY 130 billion breakdown is the revenue model mix, etc., despite drop in consolidated automobile unit sales, the low inventory and incentives control resulted in a forecast that is up JPY 40 billion.
Regarding shortages semiconductor supply, though we have seen improvement in the nine months versus the previous forecast.
There was a flood in Malaysia in the fourth quarter and drop in production due to the research of COVID-19 pandemic.
Yet, group automotive unit sales forecast remains unchanged, i.e., 4.2 million units for the full year.
Consolidated other mobile unit sales in North America is down due to the research in COVID-19 cases.
And next is SG&A is up, we had JPY 11 billion.
And due to other expenses being capital and in addition, reduced warranty expenses.
And the FY forecast compared to the actual results of last fiscal year, profit before income taxes is up JPY 105.9 billion.
Operating profit is forecast to be plus JPY 139.7 billion, excluding currency effects.
The major breakdown in items or revenue model mix despite a decrease in automobile unit sales due to incentive control, etc., it's up to JPY 4.7 billion.
Cost reduction, etc., despite the impact of searching material costs, we saw a cost reduction and price increase effects.
This combined cost reduction is JPY 35 billion minus.
And lastly, FY '22, capital expenditure, depreciation, and R&D and the forecast is as shown.
This concludes my presentation.
Thank you for your attention.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much for your attention.
So now we'd like to move on to our Q&A session.
[Operator instructions] The first question is from Yomiuri newspaper, Mr.
Katagiri, please.
"
3426,HMC,2022,3,kohei-takeuchi,director-and-senior-managing-executive-officer,False,2,"[Foreign language] Yes, about the incentives that was asked.
Well, as Katagiri-san said, the incentives yes, in terms of the consolidated unit sales, it is a negative number.
But with the control of incentives and also reduction in warranty expenses, we have managed to offset that.
Well, just looking at the incentives, especially in North America.
Last time, it was about $2,000 per unit, but it's almost half, as I said, but still at the dealers, well, I think that they have a very low stock in terms of the days.
And in the second half, we believe that the incentives in the second half of the year will be half or even less than the $2,000 incentives.
Well, the inventory at the dealers -- this has been posted as a cost at the dealership.
And therefore, this also is resulting in reducing the stock inventory and reducing the incentives.
But about the inventory at the dealerships, well, this is true in Japan as well as China.
But in North America, we see this significantly.
And so the North American incentive reduction is the major contributor.
And also the warranty expenses that are included.
Well, normally, warranty expenses include a claim.
And also we -- when being us, our customers and well, there's a recall expenses.
And it accounts for 1.1% of total sales.
But I think we have been able to curve this, meaning that we are making improvements in our quality.
And this -- therefore, we are estimating that the ratio will be less than 1.1%.
In the fourth quarter, mainly in North America and also due to the research in the omicron virus, production is not progressing.
So we have to revisit our cost expenses.
And having done that, we have concluded that we have both revenue and profit increase.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you.
Then we'd like to move on to the next question.
We have from Asahi newspaper.
We have Mr.
Kameyama, please.
Mr.
Kameyama, can you hear our voice?
"
3427,HMC,2022,3,kohei-takeuchi,director-and-senior-managing-executive-officer,False,3,"[Foreign language] So currently, the -- because of the surge in prices of raw materials.
So right now, we are thinking that about the precious metals, we are expecting a JPY 270 billion raw material increase or so.
So this time, this will go up actually to JPY 290 billion.
So where the JPY 20 billion difference coming, whereas this is the steel price in North America is about to go up.
So because of that, we will incorporate into the fourth quarter numbers.
But is that -- can we pass that on to the sales in Japan? So in North America, what's happening is because the steel material or the other metals prices going up.
So we are a making efforts to reduce the cost internally.
However, the price surge was too high that we are planning for that in some markets like in North America.
However, for Japan, we do not have any plans to raise any prices.
But if we have to in consideration of competition with other manufacturers, we might have to consider that going forward.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Mr.
Kameyama.
Next question.
Next, Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper.
Mr.
Abe? Abe from Nikkei, please.
"
3428,HMC,2022,3,kohei-takeuchi,director-and-senior-managing-executive-officer,False,4,"[Foreign language] So giving you the previous time and this time, the forecast, so there's a JPY 40 billion-plus the details of that you want to know.
So the volume I talked about it earlier, in total, so including the global sales volume, including China, that was JPY 4.2 million.
So we have not changed that target.
But because this is talking about OP, we're only looking at the consolidated ones.
So which means this about JPY 1 million minus for automobile.
This is mainly coming from North America.
So that has about JPY 70 billion impacts.
And also the incentive reduction that the dealer that we talked about in North America because the inventory level went down at the dealers.
So plus was about JPY 85 billion-plus.
And then so with that in a lesion, there was a bit of a plus upside on the financial finance as well.
So we have about JPY 40 billion.
And also cost reduction, minus JPY 37 billion.
So of that, so the steel price raises in North America.
And then, so we netted some other factors and then it came out the total of the changes in the raw material prices.

The first question about the automobile production situation currently.
Domestically, the utilization ratio when compared to the forecast, it says in the whole page, well, it is as planned.
But I will say that -- I would like to know what is happening to the production overseas, that is China.
And well, I do hear that there is such an impact of production overseas, but this reduction in production does not necessarily seem to be impacting the forecast.
So can I ask you about the stability of production overseas?
"
3434,HMC,2022,3,so-katagiri,the-yomiuri-shimbun,True,2,"[Foreign language] And the second question, I would like to know more about the increase in profit, the reason? Well, you say that you control the incentives.
And at the last meeting, in North America, you said that normally is around JPY 200,000, but it's a little more than half.
But in the past three months is the case when you further reduce the incentives.
And this trend, even if the lowest inventory and shortage of automobiles were to be resolved will this continue? And also in China, I think that the prices are going up, but are you still going to control the incentives going forward? And you said that the warranty expenses and other expenses have been controlled.
But can you elaborate on what this actually contains or includes.

3440,HMC,2022,3,hans-greimel,automotive-news,True,2,"The first question is about the incentives in North America.
A lot of automakers are benefiting now from low incentives.
But when the market returns to normal situation with better inventories and better supply, how do you see the overall market reacting to this? Do you see a shakeout of companies that are going to have to rely -- some companies will have to rely on higher incentives again? And how confident are you that you can keep incentives low when it returns the market returns? My second question is about the allocation of chips, the global allocation of chips.
You said that you are able to reallocate global chips to Japan.
Can you talk a little bit about your strategy for allocating chips and does that mean you're reallocating them from North America to Japan or from other -- some regions to other regions? Thank you.

"
3443,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,1,"[Foreign language] I would like to present to you the outline of the financial results for the third quarter and the full year forecast for fiscal year ending in '22.
I would like to start with the situations in key markets.
The total market demand in Japan was lower than the same period last year due to impact from factors, including supply shortage of semiconductors.
Honda, so we've seen some growth in models such as Brazil and the cumulative results until third quarter showed lower sales compared to the same period last year.
N-Box ranked No.
1 in the new car unit sales among Kei cars in the calendar year 2021.
While the total market during the fiscal year ending '22 showed firm demand, we believe that it will continue to be impacted by factors including semiconductor supply shortage and the resurgence of the pandemic.
Honda will strive to recover its production and will maintain its previous forecast.
Next, take a look at the total U.S.
market.
While demand recovered under the economic stimulus measure, it was still impacted by factors, including semiconductor supply shortage.
So the demand for the cumulative three quarters was almost flat compared to the same period last year.
Honda's unit sales for the three quarters surpassed the results of the same period last year due to increase in light truck models.
But if we look at the three months just through the quarter by itself, it was lower than the same period last year due to impact from semiconductor supply shortage.
And Civic, by the way, was named the 2022 North American Car of the Year by the way.
We see the total market for the fiscal year ending in '22 to sustain strong demand, but still, we expect the impact from semiconductor supply shortage and the pandemic to be significant, we believe.
Honda has revised its previous forecast downward, considering our immediate production status.
Now looking at the Chinese overall market, demand recovered, thanks to the economic stimulus measures by the government, but the impact from semiconductor shortage resulted in a lower demand compared to the same period last year.
Honda has expanded sales of XRV and saw some effect from launching the new Integra, but still, our sales was lower than in the same period last year.
The total market for the calendar year '22 is expected to surpass the previous year with solid demand, though the impact from semiconductor shortage remains.
Honda has revised its forecast upward considering the most recent sales situation.
In China, in January, Dongfeng Honda Automobile announced the construction of a factory dedicated to electric vehicles.
We will continue to further expand our electromotive vehicle product range and provide further attractive products.
Now turning to motorcycle business.
Total market, while impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic is still showing recovery in demand in many markets.
Honda also showed better results in many countries for the cumulative three quarters compared to the same period last year, but the numbers were lower in countries such as India and Vietnam due to the impact of resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic.
The total market for the fiscal year ending in 2022 is expected to see solid demand, but we expect that the impact from the resurgence of pandemic will still remain.
While Honda plans for sales volume surpassing that of the previous fiscal year, we have revised our forecast downward from the previous forecast in view of the sales status in India and the impact from semiconductor supply shortage.
Next, I would like to present the summary of the cumulative results up to the third quarter.
While the automobile unit sales declined due to a supply shortage of parts, including semiconductors, and impacted by the surging material prices, thanks to cost reduction, curbing of incentive, and a positive ForEx impact, our operating profit grew by JPY 224.6 billion to JPY 671.6 billion.
And also, the profit attributable to the owners of the parent company grew by JPY 138 billion to JPY 582.1 billion.
Unit sales and income statement highlights are as shown on the screen.
Moving on to the consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending in '22.
Compared to our previous forecast, COVID-19 pandemic is spreading again.
Supply shortage parts, including semiconductor continues and further surging prices of material continues.
Thus, the environment surrounding our business is expected to remain challenging.
But we are making further efforts to curb our SG&A expenses and incentive so as to enhance our profitability.
So we have revised our operating profit upward by JPY 140 billion to JPY 800 billion and also revised our profit for the period attributable to the owners of the parent company by JPY 115 billion to JPY 670 billion.
The unit sales and income statement highlights are as shown.
Next about dividends.
Forecast for the full year dividend for the fiscal year ending in 2022 is JPY 110, unchanged from the previously published forecast.
I would now finally, I'd like to explain the key points of the results for the third quarter for fiscal year ending in 2022.
For the three-quarter year-to-date results for the year ending '22, regarding supply shortage of semiconductors with the cooperation from our suppliers, we have adjusted our inventory allocation around the world and made changes to alternative parts.
So we have made some improvements compared to the previous forecast.
Compared to the previous fiscal year, though we have seen a decrease in automobile production volume and impact from surging prices of materials.
We have made all our own efforts and have absorbed all of the impacts and have been able to attain higher revenues and higher earnings.
Combined with our efforts so far to solidify our existing business, which have given us toughness or resilience in the face of reduced production, the strength of our frontline gemba operations capable of responding promptly to the ever-changing environment production sales situations, has shown its true benefits, we believe.
For the fiscal year 2022 full year performance forecasts, considering the flooding in Malaysia, which happened in the fourth quarter, and the impact of reduced production due to the wave of omicron variant, we are keeping the full year automobile unit sales forecast unchanged.
While the environment surrounding our business is expected to be challenging, including surging prices of raw materials, we will further reinforce our structure for generating earnings and we are revising our full year performance forecast upward.
For the next fiscal year, we expect that the impact of semiconductor shores will linger.
But we strive to further strengthen the business foundation for profitability, which we have built, and we ensure that we are well prepared for the future, and we may aim for further growth.
And next, Takeuchi will give the details.
"
3444,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,2,"[Foreign language] OK.
About the sales of automobiles.
For North America, because of the omicron variant impact, so there was a shortage of manpower.
And then for temporarily, that led to production and then that led to lower production.
That's the main cause.
On the other hand, for North America, even though it declined on a global basis, this -- we did a reallocation of semiconductors around the world.
And then for Japan, the orders are coming in very steady and many customers are patiently waiting for long-term time.
So those have helped.
For the -- I would like to ask Mr.
Takeuchi to talk about the operating profit analysis.
"
3445,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,3,"[Foreign language] Yes.
"
3446,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,4,"[Foreign language] Yes.
"
3447,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,5,"[Foreign language] We'll answer the North American incentives.
So about the incentives and the future trend.
Well, as we have been explaining, these incentives, the reduction in expenses or costs.
Of course, the unit price and compared to the price, the incentives are kept low, and we are able to do business with low incentives.
And as we said, against the dealer's inventory, we allocate the incentive based on the inventory.
And because the inventory is low at the dealers, it's only some 11 days worth in case of Honda.
And therefore, this is also a positive for us.
These combined has -- we have seen a better forecast.
Now going forward, if the supply were to increase as Hans know, the American customers, they will buy from the inventory.
And therefore, once we have an increase in the inventory to a certain extent, it's not the unit price, but the overall price will have an impact on it.
Therefore, for the unit price from next fiscal year going forward, we will expand and have new models.
And therefore, we want to try to keep down the incentives as much as possible.
But we have to consult the dealers as to how much inventory the dealers will hold.
And this part, this -- it might be some margin to increase the incentives due to this.
Well, about the allocation of chips.
Well, currently, we had identified where the chips are shortage.
We are on a daily basis, bordering the chips.
And if there are pluses or minuses, we globally across the world try to adjust the production based on the available semiconductors.
But strategy.
Well, people are going after the limited availability of chips.
And where they have a large number of production and sales, chips will be allocated.
This is natural.
And also, those products where there's a strong demand by customers, we would try to allocate the tips to those models.
And likewise, for the highly profitable products, we will give priority to allocating the chips to such products.
We're doing this on a daily basis.
But as for the strategy, this is as far as we could explain.
That is all for me.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much.
Sorry, but due to the time restriction, we'd like to make the next question the last for this session today.
Thank you.
The last one would be from Nikkei Automotive.
Mr.
Honda, please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] OK.
Thank you.
I hope you can hear me.
"
3448,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,6,"[Foreign language] Yes, we can.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Concerning the Malaysia flooding and the resurgence of the COVID, from January to February, I believe that you have announced reduced production.
Are you doing something -- some kind of specific action for the supplier was considering the impact to the production of the components, the parts, and components of the suppliers.
So I'm just wondering what you are doing.
"
3449,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,7,"[Foreign language] So basically, what we are doing is with the -- we work depending on the circumstances of the parts suppliers and the semiconductor part suppliers.
Of course, if the -- if they have some supplies and parts and inventory, we might ask them to for those to us.
But basically, it's up to how we can -- we just -- all we can do is ask for the optimum allocation with the suppliers for their supplies in line with where we need the supplies pumps.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you.
Thank you to Mr.
Honda as well.
With this, we'd like to conclude our financial results press conference.
We have the material on our website.
So please refer to it.
Once again, thank you very much for your participation and attention today.
Thank you.

"
3450,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,8,
3451,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,9,"[Foreign language] Yes.
"
3452,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,10,"[Foreign language] And the second question?
"
3453,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,11,"[Foreign language] Well, let me start to answer about the current production situation.
Well, currently, globally, there are no factories which have staffed production.
So in automobile factories, the production is normal.
When in the third quarter, including our suppliers, we have made all our effort resulting in a recovery in production earlier than expected, and unit production has recovered to some 1.08 million units, whereas the omicron research, especially in North America, the supply chain overall, they have a lack of labor and therefore, it is difficult to carry out production currently.
And in Malaysia, there was a flood.
And once again, we see that the semiconductor supply chain is impacting us.
In the fourth quarter, originally, we were estimating normalization of production, and looking at the fourth quarterback in 2019 before the COVID, it was JPY 1.35 billion.
We are expecting it to reach that level.
But given the current situation, you had to revise.
But from the third quarter to fourth quarter, we think that sales is about plus 11%.
And so for the full year, we can retain this forecast of 4.2 million units.
Well, whether this is directly linked to production.
Well, it depends on the situation about sales and marketing.
Well, it depends on the inventory of different models.
So the production impact does have an impact on some but not so much on others.
It depends.
But it is true that the production is having an impact directly on our sales and marketing.
But there is some uncertainty about COVID-19 going forward, but we want to continue to increase our revenue and profit and maximize our sales.
That is all.
Thank you.
And the reason for the increase in profit, Takeuchi will explain.
"
3454,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,12,"[Foreign language] OK.
Then let me start with the semiconductor shortage.
In the three quarters total actually, we -- for 97 terms, we were planning for 5 million units actually initially.
However, against that target, right now, we are saying 4.2 million.
So it's 0.8 million units for the year.
So for the three quarters, so maybe at about 100 and I believe we were making progress up to 130,000 in volume.
So that is the situation as of now for the third quarter.
And for the semiconductor shortage, what we are doing against that is, as we have been mentioning to you already, across the globe, we are doing some production adjustments around the world, and we are developing alternative parts and dual sourcing.
Those are the things that we are doing.
And longer-term, reviewing the suppliers.
That will be another auction, which we are taking on as well.
But unfortunately, there are some things that can take longer time and some others that can be done immediately.
So we -- as of now, we believe that even into the next fiscal year, there will be impact lingering.
So to Mr.
Takeuchi to answer the second question about the raw material price hikes.
"
3455,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,13,"[Foreign language] All of a sudden, as I say about the U.S.
interest rate hike.
The Fed is trying to move toward that direction.
And therefore, this has had an impact on the debt market -- long-term debt market in the U.S.
Now the cars that we're selling in the U.S., 60% to 70% are being financed by our Honda America Finance.
And the procurement interest rate will also increase and this procurement interest rate, this will have to be applied to our new customers.
So we do expect that customers will have to pay more.
But rather than say that it's a revenue because the costs will increase and if sales will increase, then there will be a slight time gap and an impact on our revenue, but not too long.
But if there's an interest rate hike, there is inflation.
So I think that the consumers will be reluctant to buy.
And so I think that that is a source of concern to a certain extent.
Well, about electrification, but we so far have made announcements that Honda globally will move toward electrification and carry out a number of activities.
We're exciting our efforts and product lineup of batteries.
We want to tie up with the optimum partner for each market.
But as for specifics about the progress, when the time comes, we would like to make the announcement.
So we thank you for your further indulgence until that time comes.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you, Mr.
Abe.
I would like to move on to the next question from The Wall Street Journal.
We have Mr.
Sean McLain.
"
3456,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,14,"[Foreign language] With the pandemic spreading in North America, first of all, in our factories at the supplier sites as well, there is spreading the omicron variant is having a bigger impact.
So they are finding it very difficult to secure manpower for the production.
So because of that, there were some situations where the production got sluggish for some time.
But it is not that there was a major impact as big or starts from semiconductors.
However, because it was simply not predictable.
So production never fully stopped.
But depending on the production lines, which line it was, it is continuing that some stopping suspended from time to time.
But in any case, suppliers and ourselves, we are utilizing their indirect demand power for production.
So currently, our production lines, I believe, have recovered, but still going on for the future, it's still unknown.
In any case, for the next fiscal year, the omicron expansion resurgence and the semiconductor impact will continue to some extent, unfortunately.
As I said, we are taking different actions to address those, but there are some things that cannot be addressed short term.
And at the same time, it's like everyone is grabbing to get the supplies of semiconductors and so for next fiscal year as well, we are not really in the position to be able to come up with a clear sales volume.
So currently, for the fourth quarter, right now, have about $1.15 million.
So multiple of that, by four, you get $4.6 million.
So for next year, we're estimating that in the second half, things will improve.
So we would like to aim for production and sales better than that.
That's what we can say.
That's all we can say at this point in time.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much.
Mr.

And next, Weekly Toyo Keizai.
Mr.

"
3457,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,15,"[Foreign language] Yes.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] I have also two questions.
First, about battery.
In North America, well, already, you are going into a secure battery from GM.
But going forward, what are your plans for securing battery SES? You had entered into an agreement with SES to develop the lithium secondary battery.
Is this just for North America or others? What is your thinking on tying up with SES? That's the first part.
And second, about Tesla, on the other day, they announced the financial results, and they have more than 10% annual profitability and also more than 900,000 units.
Well, yes, you say that as a business model perspective, how do you see Tesla's perspective? It could be a personal perspective.
But how do you see Tesla's business model?
"
3458,HMC,2022,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,16,"[Foreign language] About the battery, as I said in different markets, we are trying to tie up with the optimum partner for that specific market and carry out the procurement, which is fit for the market.
As for the specific situation, status, when the time comes, we will make an announcement.
So please wait until that time comes.
About development with SES.
Well, this is development is a joint development agreement.
And in North America, GM, and China's CATL.
It's not like that when we're talking about procurement.
But as a next-generation battery as candidate, we are working with them to develop the future battery.
That's all.
Thank you.
and Tesla, well, yes, this is another company and competitor.
I would like to refrain from making any specific comments.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Mr.
Yokoyama.
OK, then I'd like to take the next question from a Daily newspaper -- Automotive newspaper.
Mr.
Fukui, please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] OK.
This is Fukui from The Daily Automotive newspaper.
Thank you.
Somewhat detailed question.
But in the full year outlook for the automobile business sales for Japan, you had it was plus North America negative.
So I just would like to know the background of why your forecast came out this way.
And another one is for when did the analysis of operating profit so the variation, variability you have the curbing of volume incentive and then the reduction in sales.
So that was JPY 40 billion.
So I'd like to know about the details of that and also the cost reduction and the raw materials detailed.

3459,HMC,2022,2,keiji-kameyama,president-and-chief-operating-officer,True,0,"[Foreign language] Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Kameyama.
Can you hear me?
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Yes.
"
3460,HMC,2022,2,keiji-kameyama,president-and-chief-operating-officer,True,1,"[Foreign language] Two questions.
First, you said the group unit sales has been reduced from 4.85 million to 4.2 million.
I think that we are already seeing delivery delays now.
But as a result of this reduction.
What impact will it have on sales? And also how long do you think the current situation will continue? That's the first question.
And second question, Well, on the one hand, production is declining.
But in the United States, are you seeing a drop in sales incentive? And this is a positive for your performance.
So how much incentives have been is incentives -- incentives have been reduced? And what impact has it had on your corporate performance, please?

3462,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,0,"[Foreign language] Good to see you, everyone.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Then I would like to ask Mr.
Kuraishi to give an outline of our fiscal year '22 second quarter results.
"
3463,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,1,"[Foreign language] OK.
Allow me to explain.
Looking at the results of the second quarter for the three months, our unit sales of Honda Group showed declines in Vietnam and Thailand in motorcycle operations, declines in China and the U.S.
in automobile operations, and an increase in the U.S.
and other markets in Life Creation operations.
Turning our eye to the earnings.
Sales revenues due to lower sales in Automobile operations declined from the second quarter last year to JPY 3.4043 trillion.
Operating profit was due to reduced profit from a lower sales revenues and model mix at JPY 198.9 billion.
And equity and earnings of affiliates was due to reduced profit in China, it was JPY 51.3 billion.
Next, I would like to explain the different factors affecting profit.
Pretax profit for the second quarter was JPY 249 billion, which was down by JPY 96.6 billion compared to the same period last year.
Operating profit was, even though there was an increase due to currency effect due to decreased sales revenue and model mix leading to lower profit, it was JPY 198.9 billion, down by JPY 83.9 billion versus same period last year.
Next, going to our financial results by business segment.
Operating profit for motorcycle operations was due to reduced profit due to volume fluctuation model mix, it was JPY 67.4 billion.
Next, going to operating profit from Automobile operations and operating profit related to Automobile sales included in financial service operations is expected at JPY 127.7 billion added together.
Operating profit from Automobile operations was due to volume decrease and lower margin from model mix, it was JPY 46.4 billion.
Operating profit from financial services operations was due to difference in the amount posted as provision for credit losses, JPY 84.5 billion.
Next, looking at the operating profit for Life Creation operations and other operations, it was JPY 500 million.
Of this amount, the operating loss from aircraft and aircraft engines was at JPY 7.2 billion.
Next, the earnings for the first half of the fiscal year are as shown on the slide.
To explain the factors affecting the profit, pre-tax profit was JPY 560.3 billion, which is up JPY 288.1 billion versus the same period last year.
Operating profit was due to sales change and model mix impact increase as well as currency effect, JPY 442.1 billion, which was JPY 272.9 billion, up from the same period last year.
Next, the free cash flow for the nonfinancial services operations for the first half of the fiscal year was minus JPY 18.7 billion.
And the balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of second quarter was JPY 2.3106 trillion.
Now I'd like to explain the full year forecast for the consolidated performance for the 2022.
First, the sales volume, the unit sales of the Honda Group.
Our forecast for Motorcycle operations is 17.5 million units, which is up 100,000 units compared to the previous forecast.
In Automobile operations, considering the impact from shortages in parts supply, including semiconductors, our estimates are for 4.2 million units, down 650,000 units.
In Life Creation operations, our prospects for sales was 6.1 million units.
The financial forecast for fiscal year 2022 on a consolidated basis as shown here.
To explain the factors affecting the forecast.
Pretax profit is expected at JPY 860 billion, down JPY 54 billion compared to last fiscal year.
For operating profit, there have been a positive effect from currency effect, sales revenues, and model mix, but this was offset by sourcing raw material prices and differences from amount posted as provision for credit losses and other SG&A expenses increased so that the operating profit is expected to be flat as last fiscal year.
Equity and earnings of affiliates was because in the previous fiscal year, we had posted a temporary one-off impact of JPY 56.8 billion due to TOB of three affiliates.
It is expected to be lower by JPY 72.7 billion.
Comparing our new forecast to our earlier forecast in August, Pretax profit is expected to be low by JPY 140 billion.
In operating profit, though, SG&A reduction and currency effect generated a positive impact, this would be offset by a reduction in earnings due to sales revenue decline and model mix.
Now the forecast is for JPY 660 billion, down JPY 120 billion compared to the previous forecast.
Lastly, our prospects for capital expenditure, depreciation, and R&D expenses are as shown on the slide.
This concludes my presentation.
Thank you very much.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you for your listening.
And now we would like to proceed to questions and answers.
[Operator instructions] The first question, Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
Mr.
Abe?
"
3464,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,2,"[Foreign language] Allow me to explain about the incentives in the United States and what impact it has on our performance, especially the incentives.
Because of the large volume and the amount of money spent, this is -- the biggest part is in the United States.
But as you know, because of the delay in component supply, production is down.
And the inventory dealers are really short.
And because of this, in the past, at the dealer's, there were these incentives had to be reduced significantly because of that from the unit sales.
And this decline, this has turned out to be a positive in North America.
Last fiscal year, there's auto rater data.
There was about JPY 200,000 incentive per vehicle.
But this fiscal year, it will be slightly above half of that, and that the incentive includes the loan incentives.
And it cannot offset the drop in sales -- unit sales, but still, it is a positive for us.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you.
Then the next question will be from Nikon Automotive, Mr.
Misitori, please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Good afternoon.
This is Mr.
Misitori from Daily Newspaper -- Daily Automobile Newspapers.
I have two questions.
My first one is the raw material price surging.
At the beginning of the term, I think you were expecting a JPY 250 billion impact throughout the year.
But by changing your forecast, any impact? I mean -- of course, I mean that sourcing crisis will that's something you need to take into consideration.
Would you consider repricing the final product? Another one is the RCEP that's starting in January, do you have any expectations for that? Of course, vehicles and local other parts, all of those are localized, I'm sure, in your case, but I would just like to know what your expectations are.
Thank you.
"
3465,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,3,"[Foreign language] OK.
Let me answer about the raw material prices.
It's true, as Mr.
Misitori said, for -- at the beginning of this fiscal year, we said that JPY 250 billion to JPY 260 billion, surging higher prices for the full year.
And that included the metals -- precious metals has used in the catalyst because the prices have really surged.
So that's why we came up with that expectation.
But the precious metals unit price has -- of course, there were some intervention for the government, and they are coming down somewhat from the peak.
But aluminum and steel, those other materials for those -- so we are still expecting the higher prices of those.
And then so we still incorporated those increasing prices of those other materials.
But right now, still we are expecting JPY 260 billion-or-so impact.
But any incorporation into the selling prices? No, we cannot transfer all those cost increases to our vehicle prices.
But we will monitor what the competitors are doing.
And then we might -- we will monitor what the competitors are doing, and we might include the increase of prices.
If it's OK with the customers.
OK.
So for RCEP, we are far advanced with the localization because we want to produce where the demand is.
So we don't think there's going to be that bad impact, but we will monitor the situation and take actions necessary.
Thank you
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much and next, Automotive News.
Hans, please?
"
3466,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,4,"[Foreign language] Well, let me try to answer your foreign exchange question.
Yes, as Hans says, the foreign exchange, well, on the one hand, we are supplying components in North America.
And also, we have to convert the North American profit to Japanese yen.
So the foreign exchange rate has a big impact on us, and the weak yen is favorable for us.
And if you compare the forecast last time from the second quarter, it was JPY 105, and it's actually JPY 110 in the second quarter.
And in the third quarter after, we have replaced JPY 110 against the dollar.
So because of this, we are seeing an impact of some JPY 50 billion on profitability revenue.
But as we hear, there -- the quantitative easing being reviewed in the United States and -- so I think that there might be a shift toward a stronger dollar.
And this would be a positive.
But when it comes to strong dollar.
Well, we're not just doing operation in the U.S.
and Japan, we're doing Brazil and supplying United States and also Thailand, etc.
So the local currencies, if they become weak and then the imported components will see a negative impact.
So we have to look at the overall situation.
It's not as simple to say that we just look at the U.S.
dollar and see the weak yen is advantageous.
No.
But what we're saying is that we have to be -- well, if there's $1 swing throughout the year, then we see an impact of JPY 112 billion.
So in the second half, I hope that we see a tailwind, but it's not as simple as that because we have to think about other currencies other than the U.S.
dollar.
"
3467,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,5,"[Foreign language] OK.
And then about the -- our view on the resource prices.
As I mentioned already earlier, it is true that the PGM for the precious metals at the beginning of the fiscal year because of the speculation, there was some -- unit price went really surged high.
And depending on the market -- so there are some metals where structurally, the demand could be high.
So we do consider the price can stay high structurally or long term.
So how do we minimize the impact from that? So maybe we come up with alternative materials for that for certain parts in the car or can we review our specifications so that we can reduce the amount we used and then the purchase contracts can maybe do long-term contracts.
And then we will take actions, different actions.
And if it has to be, we might transfer the cost increase to the prices.
But anyway, so to simply put, we do expect that there's a possibility that the prices go up.
OK, thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Next question, NHK, Mr.
Tivoli, please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Mr.
Tivoli from NHK.
How do you do? About the raw material.
This is a follow-up to the previous question.
Crude oil price is extremely high now.
Of course, steel, aluminum, you gave those examples, but about crude oil price, sorry.
I think that this has an impact on resin manufacturers.
So how much of an impact does it have? Currently, how much of an impact is it having? And going forward, if this should continue going forward, how much impact are you foreseeing?
"
3468,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,6,"[Foreign language] Well, as we've been saying, yes, oil is about $85 per barrel.
So it's extremely high.
And resin, you said, yes, some plastic.
They are being made from crude oil and the painting, the coating on cars.
Again, this is made from crude oil.
And currently, the prices have not gone up.
But if the crude oil prices continue to surge, it will have an impact.
The question then is how will we come up with alternative materials.
We are currently researching that and so that we would try to absorb the cost increase coming from the raw material cost increase.
So we also tried to offset with reducing the cost in other areas and so as to be able to offer our customers with good products.
Yes, as you say, Mr.
Tivoli, the components that we use and the impact of crude oil price increase is something that we are factoring in.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you.
The next question from Weekly Toyo Keizai.
Mr.
Yokoyama, please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] This is Yokoyama from Toyo Keizai.
I have two questions as well.
First one is the profitability, profit margin in automobile business.
So it's a 2.6 percentage at the end of second quarter.
So at 1.0, it looks like it's gotten better from 1.0 for the full term, but how do you view that? You talked about the incentive coming down.
But I'm just wondering if the automobile business renovation is taking bearing fruit? Or I'm just wondering if the -- maybe the stock has gotten lower and maybe that's what's boosting the profitability.
Let me just like, you know, my second question is about the battery.
So you said, you are thinking about a lot of our investment.
You have not made it clear whom you might team up within Japan.
I'm sure you cannot mention any name.
But if you could tell me your approach.
And then fourth, so you've got GM states and CATL for China.
But do you have any multiple sourcing idea for those markets as well? Thank you.

3469,HMC,2022,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-senior-managing-executive-director",False,7,"[Foreign language] OK, about the automobile business operations profitability.
As Mr.
Yokoyama said, the automobile business of -- we consider this a big challenge in our company.
So we have been working to renovate, innovate the profitability of automobile business.
And then within that, in the production volume, we wanted to optimize the production volume.
So in U.K.
and Turkey, we have compressed fixed cost in those markets.
And then even against the -- even midst of COVID, we have had some good results.
So for U.K., let's say, we have stopped the production already and then the Sayama Plant will close at the -- stop production at the end of December.
And also, we have some -- brought in some organizational changes that brought some efficiency in R&D.
So the automobile development team used to be in R&D, we have moved it to Honda Motors organization so that we can provide better efficiencies or better products to our customers through lower prices.
So we have been doing those innovation projects.
So we are seeing good benefits.
But this would take several years for the full benefits to come through.
So by then, we will have solid profitability from automobile business.
But if you think about the efficiency of development work and the optimization of production.
And then I don't know how -- we still need to consider how we are going to do this together in the EV business.
So we will need to -- might wait until next opportunity.
So, so far, we have been optimizing and then we have been getting better benefits from optimizing the existing businesses anyway.
And then now the incentive is lower and then the stock level is lower, so profitability is getting higher.
But if the -- so do we have to bring back the incentive when the stock comes back? I guess we cannot really say no outright considering the competition.
But now we've come up with a good profitability structure, foundation infrastructure.
So we probably would have to work better so that we can provide better products, better value to our customers at a lower incentive.
So it's not going to be the incentive comes right back just because the stock went back up.
So we hope that we continue -- can continue to secure good profits.

"
3472,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,1,"[Foreign language] I would like to begin by expressing my profound gratitude to the support given to us by our loyal customers, supporters, and all other stakeholders around the world.
Currently, there are customers who are waiting for Honda products.
We sincerely apologize for the vehicle production delay and the inconvenience caused.
The drop in production attributable to a combination of supply shortage of certain parts, including semiconductors and lockdown in mainly Southeast Asia due to the resurgence of COVID-19 was greater than our previous forecast.
As a result, FY 2022, Q2, Automobile Group unit sales was 917,000 units.
Honda is developing alternative equivalent parts and taking other measures to promote deal source of components.
We will recover production from the beginning of next year.
But given the prolonged lockdown in Asia among others, FY 2022 Automobile Group unit sales forecast is revised downward from 4.85 million units to 4.2 million units.
With the cooperation from various stakeholders, we will strive to keep impact on production to a minimum, and we will work to deliver our products to our customers as early as possible.
I'll move on to present the outline of FY 2022, second quarter financial results, and fiscal year 2022 financial forecast.
FY '22 is six months unit sales was: Motorcycles, 8,173,000 units; Automobiles, 1,915,000 units; Life Creation business, 3,230,000 units.
Next, the main markets.
Japan's six-month industry demand exceeded the same period last year.
But the three-month sales was hard hit by semiconductor supply shortage and was below the same period last year.
Despite strong sales vessel, Honda's three-month unit sales was down from the same period last year.
N-BOX Series set No.
1 sales in minicar segment for the first half of FY 2022.
Forecast for FY 2022 industry demand is expected to be strong despite semiconductor shortage.
Honda has revised the previous forecast given the current production situation.
Next is United States.
Industry demand recovered due to stimulus package and others.
Fiscal six months total was above the same period of the previous year.
Second quarter three months was lower due to semiconductor supply shortage.
Honda performed the market growth with light trucks as the main driver.
Passport updated its single-month sales record.
It sets at an all-time monthly sales record in September.
In June, we announced the name of the first Honda brand volume, EV SUV in North America.
The name is Prologue.
FY 2022 industry demand forecast despite semiconductor supply shortage, demand is expected to continue to be strong.
Honda has revised the previous forecast, reflecting the current production situation.
Next, China.
Industry demand recovered primarily due to economic stimulus measures.
But semiconductor shortage resulted in demand lower than the same period last year.
Honda also saw strong sales of XR-V among others, but the Q2 three-month sales underperformed the same period last fiscal year.
Calendar year 2021 industry demand forecast expected to stay strong, exceeding last calendar year.
Honda will increase its EV lineup and offer attractive products.
In October, we announced our electrification strategy in China.
First, Honda brand, China EV car, e:N series was unveiled.
Honda's omnidirectional advanced driver-assistance system, Honda SENSING 360, will be deployed in China in 2022.
Moving on to our motorcycle business industry demand.
In many countries, demand recovered and exceeded the same period last year.
Honda's Q2 six months total exceeded the previous year.
But regarding the second quarter three months total wholesales dropped from the same period last year in Vietnam and Thailand due to resurgence of COVID-19.
FY 2022 forecast, industry demand, though there is still concern over a COVID-19 resurgence, demand is expected to increase steadily.
Honda revised upward its forecast, primarily based on the current sales in India and Indonesia.
Outline our FY 2022, three months results.
Despite the impact of semiconductor supply shortage and increase in raw material costs, due to positive effects of unit sales increase, cost reduction, and currency, operating profit increased JPY 272.9 billion to JPY 442.1 billion.
Also, the earnings per share attributable to owners of the parent due to increase in share profit investments accounted for using the equity method increased by JPY 229.1 billion to JPY 389.2 billion.
Unit sales and income statement are as shown.
And next, our FY 2022 financial forecast.
COVID-19 resurgence, shortage of certain parts include -- including semiconductors and rise in raw material prices are expected to continue.
Though we anticipate a harsh external environment, reduction -- SG&A cost reduction and other profit enhancement efforts are expected to result in maintaining operating profit at JPY 660 billion equivalent to last fiscal year.
Unit sales and income statements are as shown.
Next, about dividends.
FY 2022 interim dividend is JPY 55 per share.
Annual dividend outlook remains unchanged.
Honda will strive to continue to realize stable shareholders' return aiming toward a payout ratio of around 30%.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Now we'd like to have Mr.
Takeuchi, our director, and senior managing executive officer, to provide details for our quarter financial results and forecasts.
"
3473,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,2,"[Foreign language] Well, first, let me talk about the impact of semiconductor shortage.
First, last time, some of the suppliers experienced a fire and there was a shortage of supply as well as the low temperature in the United States and lockdown in Southeast Asia.
And therefore, we believe that it was a one-time impact, but we decided to reduce our prospect to 4.8 million from the 5 million originally anticipated.
But we now see that the shortage, the supply shortage has even more serious and will last longer, the lockdown as likewise.
So it's been reduced to 4.2 million.
Well, we were anticipating that we will see a recovery in supply from the third quarter.
But regrettably, because of the long duration of the lockdown in Southeast Asia, we were unable to do so.
We are planning to make a recovery from the beginning of next year, but we believe that it will be difficult to achieve the recovery by the end of this fiscal year.
As for the prospect of being able to secure the necessary semiconductors, we have yet -- we have tried to look into this now.
As for the future prospects, due to the shortage of semiconductors, we don't know what the challenges will be in the future.
We are starting to see improvements now.
And we are also working to ensure dual sourcing so as to gain toughness against these incidents and cope with the supply chain situation.
So we are currently preparing for next fiscal year.
And in addition to recovery production in next fiscal year, our model cycle will be at a very good timing.
And therefore, we will do our very best to meet the demands.
And also about the April-September production, well, I'll explain about that later.
And whether the current drop in production will have an impact on our future strategies.
That part of your question.
As I said earlier, from next fiscal year, we believe that the semiconductor supply will improve.
And this fiscal year, well, this negative operating profit, whether this will have an impact -- direct impact on our automobile and reform EV.
No, we do not think so.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much for the Global Production, Corporate Communications will provide an answer later, OK.
The next question is from Yomiuri newspaper, Mr.
Katagiri, over to you.
"
3474,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,3,"[Foreign language] Yes.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] The impact from our reduced production, Japan and China, it's OK, the -- sorry, it was lower than expected.
But in the state, there was a good demand.
But probably other than the models, was there any reason for the better demand in the U.S.? And then if you could share with me the regional differences about the demand going forward for the rest of the fiscal year? So I guess, I think, for November, so still the demand is very low, but I just wonder how the demand there are for the rest of the world? My second question is a prospect for the future.
But the raw materials prices and then the risk for China, what do you -- how do you view the risks in China?
"
3475,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,4,"[Foreign language] OK.
Thank you.
OK.
I'm repeating myself.
But with the COVID-19 impact and the harbor traffic congestion, the lockdown in Asia impacting the parts.
There are various factors impacting the supply chain.
That is the current situation.
Particularly, the lockdown in Asia -- those are having a prolonged impact compared to our initial estimate, but we'd like to minimize, continue to minimize the impact we suffer.
So stock inventory allocation, and we're reviewing our allocation and production stock situation on a weekly basis.
And then we are trying to monitor the supply, particularly semiconductor.
And if there's any shortage, we will adjust.
We are adjusting production on a global basis.
Maybe we need to monitor the balance across different regions and then consider we are doing -- allocating the semiconductors.
But the semiconductor, of course, there are many different types.
And depending on our parts and components, there were available ones and not so available once that there are differences.
So I can't say generally, but basically, our stance is that along with the sales planning we do proper allocation.
But as well because different models mix are there.
So there are differences between different regions as a result.
But in principle, going forward as well for different reasons, we want to -- we will continue to monitor the sales situation on a weekly basis and continue our timely allocation.
That's our strategy.
And then for the power shortage in China, currently, as of now for the two joint ventures in China.
We have not seen any impact due to the power shortage, including their suppliers.
So we will closely monitor the future conditions and then take action, if needed.
But currently, Guangqi Honda and then the other entity as well.
Those are important production sites in those regions -- in these regions.
So they are closely monitoring the situation.
So we would like to continue to monitor the situation closely together with the central government to monitor the situation.
Thank you.

[Foreign language] The next question, Asahi Shimbun, Mr.
Kameyama, please.
"
3476,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,5,"[Foreign language] Well, first, I will respond to the unit sales.
So the semiconductor supply delay has resulted in us having our customers wait for the delivery of our products.
We apologize for the delay.
Well, currently, based on the plan that we have for the unit sales, we are in communication to ensure the delivery date.
We don't think that we'll see any further delays, but COVID-19 impact.
We have to see what impact will continue.
And so observing the situation, we will try everything to try to deliver cars to our customers as early as possible.
So as for semiconductors, as I said, from the fourth quarter, we believe that we will start to see a recovery.
And we can enter into a recovery production phase.
That is all.

3477,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,6,"[Foreign language] About the shift to EV and the specific strategies.
Well, in regards to transition, yes, battery -- we want to partner with the best for the local.
I'm sorry, GM in the U.S.
and CATL in China.
So we are working with those partners, and we're already making the investments necessary.
For other regions as well, we have to look at the local conditions, etc and consider various possibilities, including alliance.
As for factories, the other day in China, and we announced our EV strategy and, GHAC, WDHAC, we said that we will start to aim toward operation so that we can establish an environment-friendly factory.
So as for the details, well, I'm not in a position to disclose them now.
But we are making such preparations.
And when the time comes, we will be able to announce to you is including the investment numbers and what we are doing.
But please allow me not to disclose those numbers today.

Mr.
Hiraoka, please?
"
3478,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,7,"[Foreign language] For the semiconductor long-term, of course, we need to think about how we -- how much of our stock we want to hold.
And then we might think about like reviewing our contracts, about purchase agreements, also relationship with the semiconductor manufacturers.
We need to consider the supply chain and also we need to maybe work with the -- try to increase our toughness against semiconductor supply issues like working with the tier ones' company.
So we are taking those actions at the same time.
Currently, we are doing tests to use off-the-shelf semiconductor as well.
And then -- with that, we are trying to think of different options to obtain semiconductor -- secure semiconductor supplies.
Of course, we believe that the semiconductor shortage will continue going forward.
So we will continue to take -- and think of and then take actions in order to secure stable supply of semiconductors in different ways.
That completes my answer.
"
3479,HMC,2022,2,seiji-kuraishi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,8,"[Foreign language] OK.
About the battery strategy.
As we -- as I mentioned earlier, for large markets for China and then states, like I've said, we got GM for states, and then we got CATL for China.
Those are the ideas we have.
And at the same time, for Japan and for other markets, right now, we are still considering.
But our stance to that is that for Japan, we want to produce batteries in Japan and then consume them in Japan, so we can contribute to the local economy.
That's the consideration for the Japan market.
We don't have any specific thing we can share with you.
About the -- and then also for multiple sourcing for the other markets, for states in the U.S., we need to think about the States-China relationship as well.
So we need to closely monitor the situation and then make decisions.
There was a possibility, I'd say.
That's all I can say for now.

First, about the group sales unit and the revision that you've paid.
Well, this is a new number of 4.2 million.
What is the accuracy -- the outlook of semiconductor shortage and the prospect of being able to secure the semiconductors? What measures you're taking to enhance the prospect? And also, from April-September, the world production, how much reduction in production did you see compared to the original plan? The second question.
Well, currently, there is shortage of semiconductors.
But the profit that has been undermined, be it the automobile reform or investment in EV vehicles, does this not have any negative impact on your future plans? So can you elaborate on your views as to how the current shortage will impact future plans?

Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Yes, we can hear you.
"
3486,HMC,2022,2,hiraoka-daisuke,newspicks,True,1,"[Foreign language] Earlier this was mentioned about the semiconductor shortage.
I would like to ask a little bit more detailed question.
And at the same time, are your actions for the future -- for going forward about the semiconductor shortages, I'm sure -- you said that there are many different types.
But when it comes to the most, it is not that the most advanced semiconductors only are used in the automobile.
So I believe some ECU contains those 200-micrometer wafers, those legacy types are used as well.
So the legacy semiconductors for the semiconductor producers, ROI is low.
So they don't have a priority on producing them first.
So as the shortages get resolved, that type of production might be a bottleneck? Do you agree with me? And then another question is, are you trying to do some ECU integration? So that you might come up with a new technology for production like using 28-nanometer or 22-nanometer ECU.
Would you be considering integration into those types over like five years or so.
I'm just wondering if you have that kind of strategy.
And then my second question is concerning your prospects for the raw materials, resources prices, I think back in 2017, there were some surging prices.
So I'm sure that there is a chance that it might go down, but like copper and then rare metals, because people go to electronics, those prices, the demand will be increasing for those structurally.
So I believe even if there is some fluctuation in the prices, they will be structurally, the long-term wise, long term, I believe, the prices might go up.
I'm just wondering if you have that kind of prospects for the prices.

3488,HMC,2022,2,hans-greimel,automotive-news,True,0,"[Foreign language] I have two questions.
One is about the foreign exchange rate.
It's been a real tailwind for a lot of Japanese automakers lately.
I think you're keeping it steady for the rest of the fiscal year.
Do you expect the exchange rate to maybe help you improve your full year results in the end if it keeps moving in this direction? And the second question is about your provisions for the shift to electric vehicles.
When will we start to see some kind of investment or outlays or announcements from Honda about your investments in batteries or new electric vehicle lines or factories? Already, we hear from other Japanese automakers about their investments in electric vehicles, but yet they don't even have as ambitious plans of total makeover for electric vehicles only as Honda.
When can we start to see or expect some announcements or provisions from Honda?

So, I would like to know specifically what prices you raised and which region.
And that I believe other companies are trying to raise prices as well.
But I guess the transferring the raw material prices hikes, I think that is becoming an issue.
So, I would just like to know if you are considering that kind of a transfer.
So, that's what I'd like to know.
That was my first question.
Second question concerning production.
So, from April to June, you said you were on plan.
You are to plan.
But compared to the previous year, when would you say you will be recovering compared to year on year? So, starting this this term, or do you think your recover income from third quarter? What would you say?

This is Hans Greimel from Automotive News.
I'm wondering if you could give us an outlook for the recession possibilities in the United States, what the the economic forecast is for a possible recession in the United States, and what Honda is doing for counter-measures there.
Also, can you give us more details about the price increases in the United States? How sensitive is the market there to price increases? And is this something that you expect to keep doing further into the rest of the fiscal year and into the possibly future next year as well?

3496,HMC,2023,1,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,0,"[Foreign language] OK.
Allow me to start the explanation.
To begin, Honda Group's unit sales for first quarter of fiscal year to March 2023.
In motorcycle operations, unit sales to a year and year, in particular in Asia, and it came to 4,251,000 units.
Automobile came to 815,000 units, mainly due to declines in China and North America.
In power products, volume came to 1,546,000 units, mainly due to a decline in North America.
Next, I'd like to explain the factor analysis of pre-tax profit for Quarter 1 compared to the same period last year.
Pretax profit was 237.4 billion yen, which was lower by 73.9 billion yen compared to the first quarter last year.
Operating income was 222.2 billion yen, which was lower by 20.9 billion yen on the year.
To give you a breakdown of the substantive decline of our 85.1 billion yen, net of the currency impact, impact in sales came to -- though there were reduction in incentives, decline in automobile sales volume and other factors led to a decline of 89.4 billion yen.
Selling price and cost factors.
While there was impact from surging material prices, we strove to raise our selling prices and to reduce costs.
We reached an increase in profit by a 14.4 billion yen.
Expenses due to increase mainly in quality-related expenditures.
This gave us a negative impact of 12.0 billion yen.
Next, to explain sales revenues and operating income by business segment.
For motorcycles, operating income was 97.8 billion yen.
Automobile income was 83 -- sorry, 38.2 billion yen.
Operating income from financial services was 78.8 billion yen.
The sum of the automobile businesses operating income and that associated with automobile sales, including financial services, is estimated to be 113.9 billion yen.
Next, for power products business and other businesses, operating profit came to 7.3 billion yen.
Of this amount, the operating loss from aircraft and aircraft engine was 3.8 billion yen.
Next, I will explain the cash flow.
Free cash flow of the operating entities for fiscal year.
For the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 came to minus 149.3 billion yen.
And the end-of-term balance of net cash came to 2,310.1 billion yen.
Next, I'd like to talk about the consolidated financial forecast for the FY ending in 2023.
Firstly, speaking of Honda Group's unit sales, we are keeping the previous forecasts unchanged.
So, the forecast in motorcycle is 18,560,000 units; in automobiles, 4.2 million units; and in power products, 5,665,000 units.
And next, I'd like to explain the factor analysis of pre-tax profit compared to the actual results from last fiscal year.
Pretax profit is forecast at 1,040 billion yen, down by 30.1 billion yen from the previous year's results.
Operating income is forecast at 830.0 billion yen, down by 41.2 billion yen from the previous year's results.
I will explain the substance of decline of 207.2 billion yen net of currency effects.
Impact from sales is positive 169.8 billion yen due to increase in motorcycle automobile sales volume.
Selling price and cost impact is negative 146.0 billion yen due to the impact of sourcing material prices.
Expenses impact is expected to be negative 148.0 billion yen due to increase of quality-related expenses and selling expenses.
Next, the changes compared to our previous forecast are positive 5.0 billion yen for pre-tax profit and positive of 20.0 billion yen for operating income.
The decline of 60.0 billion yen net of the currency effects is because the impact from inflation has been taken into account.
Lastly, compared to previous forecast, forex impact has been incorporated in the forecast for capital expenditure depreciation and R&D expenditure for full year to March 2023.
This completes my presentation.

[Foreign language] Thank you very much for your attention.
Then we'd like to move on to the Q&A session.
As informed in advance, we will like to take questions via Zoom.
And due to the time restrictions, we'd like to limit it to two questions per speaker, please.

"
3497,HMC,2023,1,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,1,"[Foreign language] OK.
OK.
For the first quarter, the equity method, the interest, I'd like to answer that one.
I believe you see this waterfall graph.
We have this opportunity, 3.3 billion yen decline.
This was this portion.
The biggest portion came from China.
But as I mentioned, as we have announced already the other day, we will have to be selective for EV.
So, what we will do in China for the Acura business, we will discontinue the Acura business.
That's what we have incorporated.
So, we have some losses from there.
So, it's temporary, and also complaints.
And also we have some domestic subsidiaries.
We recently we had some -- due to the share prices, the equity method, we had some impairment losses due to the -- this is only the some of the domestic subsidiaries.
And then also the pension system was changed.
And then there were some losses in accounting.
So, those are the parts of the 33.3 of the -- half of that is coming from those factors.
And then the remaining half.
Is coming from the business operations.
From the first quarter, the volume unit sales saw impact in China, as well as in Japan as well.
So, this is of the same range as the operating income.
OK.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Yamane.

[Foreign language] Can you hear me? Yes, please.
"
3498,HMC,2023,1,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,2,"[Foreign language] Thank you very much for that question.
Well, about the FY '23 focused and the relationship between net profit and operating profit.
As for the operating profit target, Takeuchi has explained that we are taking into account the currency of 130 yen and 120 yen in the first and second half.
And so, it's a plus and 20 billion yen for the operating profit.
As the first quarter for the equity method and the related companies in Japan, there was the impairment of this geos in Japan and therefore the equity profit and method profit has been reduced and also the operating profit.
As it increases, there will be more corporate tax to be paid.
So, we have to factor in this negative.
And therefore, the 20 billion and also so 15 -- 10 billion has been offset as a result of this.

About my first question about the semiconductor situation.
In the first quarter, there was a Shanghai lockdown.
And there was this impact, and there was a reduction in production volume.
But currently, the Shanghai lockdown.
how much of the effect is still with you now? And about the shortage of semiconductor supply, when about do you think that this can be resolved? And also, if you are seeing some improvements and what initiatives that Honda is taking is resulting in these good results.

3502,HMC,2023,1,satoshi-sugiyama,thomson-reuters,True,0,"[Foreign language] OK, this is Sugiyama from Reuters.
Yes, we can hear you.
We have two questions.
The first question is about the semiconductor related one.
And earlier, with the -- I think there was a risk with the restrictions on the Taiwan Strait.
I guess there's a focus about it that the military practices by China.
So, I believe for a stable procurement of semiconductors, are you going to stay -- assume that there could be some incidents in Taiwan so that they will try to reduce the procurement percentage, if from Taiwan or from China? Are you doing anything to ensure stable supply? That's one question.
And the second question, in the States, a senator came up with a law to reduce inflation.
And then they said that the they came up with a tax -- they made stringent the qualification for the EV, the incentive sorry, EV incentive factory.
And then -- so, even for the -- this may become a hinder adoption of the electrical EV.
So, we'd like to hear what you have about that.

3504,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,0,"[Foreign language] First of all, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to our loyal customers around the world and all stakeholders who are supporting Honda.
Thank you very much indeed.
Currently, we have a number of customers waiting for the delivery of our vehicles.
We will do our utmost to deliver products to our customers as soon as possible.
We hope to gain your understanding.
I'd now like to explain our fiscal year '23, our first quarter financial results and FY '23 financial forecast.
First, FY '23 first quarter financial results.
Automobile production and unit sales, despite semiconductor supply shortage and Shanghai lockdown, bringing down unit sales from the same quarter last year in mainly China and North America, they were in line with the previous forecast.
Operating profit was down from the same quarter last year.
However, despite drop in automobile unit sales and soaring raw material costs, motorcycle unit sales were up, and companywide efforts were made to improve profit, resulting in operating margin equivalent to that of the same period last year.
Next, FY '23 financial forecast.
The outlook remains uncertain due to semiconductor supply shortage and inflation.
Honda's group unit sales plan for FY '23 remains unchanged from the previous forecasts.
But given the profit increase effect of the currency rate and forecasted cost increase due to inflation, we have revised upward our sales revenue and operating profit forecast.
At today's board meeting, a decision was made to acquire own shares up to 100 billion yen.
Honda will continue to accelerate efforts to enhance corporate value and promote electrification and other new growth initiatives.
Next, I will explain our main market automobile sales.
Despite the effect of new model launches, such as a Step WGN in Japan and HR-V in the United States, shortage of chips and the Shanghai lockdown effect resulted in unit sales lower than the same quarter last fiscal year in the respective markets.
In the United States, there was solid demand.
Sales were down from the same period last year because, last year, dealers had inventory to sell.
FY' 23 sales forecasts remain unchanged.
Though we expect demand to stay strong, outlook remains uncertain due to semiconductor supply shortage and resurgence of COVID-19.
Honda will actively launch new models to the market, such as CR-V and Z-RV so as to boost sales.
Next, motorcycle business.
Due to semiconductor shortage, unit sales dropped from the same period last year in some countries.
But unit sales increased significantly in our largest market, India.
And overall, we exited the same period last year.
Regarding FY' 23 sales, taking into account semiconductor shortage, we decided to stick to the previous forecast.
However, by replacing some models on sale, utilizing alternative parts, we will aim to further increase unit sales.
Next FY '23 three months results summary consolidated.
Despite drop in unit sales and due to semiconductor supply shortage and Shanghai lockdown, combined with rising raw material costs due to price cost impacts and reduction in incentives and currency effects, operating profit was 222.2 billion yen.
Profit for the period was 149.2 billion yen due to decrease in Chinese investment profits under the equity method.
Unit sales and income statements are as shown.
Next is the FY '23 consolidated financial forecasts.
In the forecast announced last time, despite uncertainty attributable to semiconductor supply shortage and COVID-19 resurges, given the currency and inflation impact and cost increase, we revised upward operating profit to 830 billion yen.
The assumed US dollar-yen currency rate in the first half is 130 yen; second half, 120 yen; annually, 125 yen.
The forecast profit for the period remains unchanged from the previous forecast at 710 billion yen.
Unit sales and income statement are as shown.
Next, FY '23 annual dividend is 120 yen, unchanged from the last announcement.
At today's board meeting, a resolution was adopted to acquire our own shares.
In order to improve efficiency of capital structure, implement flexible capital strategy, Honda acquired its own shares.
Total amount of shares to be acquired will be maximum 100 billion yen.
Next, Mr.
Fujimura, operating executive and head of accounting and finance supervisory unit, will explain the details of the results and forecast.
"
3505,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,1,"[Foreign language] Thank you very much.
Well, about your question, about the Shanghai impact and also the impact of the semiconductor supply shortage.
Allow me to try to explain to you what the situation is.
The lockdown in China, yes, in April, I think you've already seen the numbers, but the Shanghai lockdown, when compared to the same quarter last year, and we have seen a significant negative number.
That is true.
But when we made our forecast announcement for automobile group sales, it was 4.2 million units.
And we had factored in the prolonged Shanghai lockdown.
So, compared to our plan, we think that things were within the scope of our assumption.
So, please understand that this is a case.
And in fact, the Shanghai lockdown has almost been totally lifted in June, July compared to the same period, or same month the previous year, there were positive numbers.
And therefore I think things have normalized.
That is how we understand this.
And in the second half, we want to work hard to recover.
Now, about the semiconductors.
Currently, as you have seen in the newspapers and others, other industries like computers and cellphones.
And those sectors, there is some excess supply.
And we think that semiconductors will become available.
But when it comes to the automobile industry, that is not the impression that we are getting.
For the time being, we think that we will continue to see a shortage.
This is the current understanding.
There are different types of semiconductors, and there are different types that we have to manage.
The semiconductors depending on the type.
And we will continue to allocate based on what is available.
Now, when about do you think that we can resolve this? We think that until the end of this fiscal year, we'll continue to see the impact of this semiconductor shortage.
So, until the end of this fiscal year, we need to handle the situation and take into consideration that there will continue to be this shortage.
We want to make every effort to deliver our products to our customers as soon as possible.
Now, how are we going to recover this shortage, as we said earlier, with our suppliers, we are negotiating one on one.
Have them hold inventory where possible, and also try to develop alternative parts.
And also, depending on the type, I think that we have to sense and do risk management depending on the different types of semiconductors.
And therefore, if some of the suppliers, including the price, we are doing a long-term contract so as to secure the necessary supply of semiconductors.
But as I've explained, we are continuing to see this situation of shortage.
That is all.
Thank you.

[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Ms.
Tanabe.
The next question -- I'd like to move on to the next question.
From Asahi newspaper, Mr.
Kameyama, please.
"
3506,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,2,"[Foreign language] Yes, we can hear you.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] One question for you.
The decline in the first quarter.
You talked about the decline in equity in China due to equity method.
So, I would like to know about it.
"
3507,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,3,"[Foreign language] Yes, please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Nikkan Jidosha Shimbun.
[Inaudible] is my name.
Well, I have one question.
Well, the semiconductor shortage and others say that the delivery date has been delayed.
But what measures is Honda trying to take to make up for this delay?
"
3508,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,4,"[Foreign language] Well, as for the measures, well, we are very keen to deliver our vehicles to our customers as soon as possible.
But depending on the model type, there are cases in which we have to keep our customers waiting for a long period of time.
And in some cases, we had to suspend acceptance of orders.
It's been resumed.
But we are trying to avoid causing inconvenience to our customers.
As I've explained, this is serious shortage of semiconductor supply.
We are trying to resolve this.
And so to the suppliers which are supplying us with semiconductors, we are talking with them.
And so, every -- on a weekly basis and a monthly basis, we come up with a production plan.
And we are working hard to deliver our vehicles to our customers as soon as possible.
But as earlier said, until the end of this fiscal year, we think that the shortage of semiconductors, especially automotive semiconductors, will continue.
And so, we have to look at which models can be delivered at an early date in which markets and especially for those customers who are waiting long, we are trying to resolve this situation as soon as possible and understand that we are causing inconvenience to our customers.
We want to apologize, but we hope that people will understand the situation that we are currently placed in.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Mr.
[Inaudible].
The next questions are coming from Reuters, Mr.
Sugiyama.
"
3509,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,5,"[Foreign language] OK, geopolitical risk about Taiwan, well, it is true that semiconductor is -- is already concentrated in Taiwan.
Outside Taiwan, this would be China and then the States.
But in we are -- there are some semiconductor factories, new ones built in Japan, but they are still taking some time.
So, we need to continue trying to do a dual sourcing, but it's true that other locations are different.
But we need to do design changes and also keep a higher level of inventory.
So, those aren't really specific, maybe you might say that.
But we will continue to take those actions and think of all the further actions.
For the -- it is true.
This geopolitical risk is difficult.
But with [Inaudible] as well, we are consulting every party we can in engaging all the whole automotive industry and then are considering options for the future.
That's what I can tell you at this point in time.
About the Senate -- the States, the Inflation Act to curb inflation.
So, it's difficult to say what our view is.
The current model may not be eligible.
But we want to aim for carbon neutrality, so we would like to utilize our technology that we have, EV and FSEV, those are the technologies available.
So, we would like to be able to launch EV, electric vehicle.
And that's because -- before the factory becomes eligible for a tax credit.
But we need to be able to come up with the vehicles in terms of tanks to wheel.
So, we will focus our efforts -- all our efforts in trying to from -- first come up with the being able to launch a vehicle that will help in this carbon neutrality.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you, Mr.
Sugiyama.
And next question will be the last question.
[Inaudible] please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] [Inaudible] Thank you very much.
I have just one question here about the fiscal year outlook, a forecast you've revised.
The operating profit has increased, and the net profit remains unchanged.
What is the logic of this upward revision and retaining the net profit?
"
3510,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,6,
3511,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,7,"[Foreign language] Yes.
"
3512,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,8,"[Foreign language] OK.
Thank you.
About the selling price, let me answer that one.
So, going back to the previous year -- previous fiscal year, to two previous years ago, we have started seeing impact from 270 billion yen -- from two years ago to the previous year.
And then we did have some -- in fact, including inflation as well.
And then the transportation and labor would raise, we were thinking 290 billion yen raises expected.
So, plus we have a 60 billion yen in addition.
So, in raw prices and then the cost inflation, everything included.
We have accounted for those.
And then from two years ago to last year, we have made the efforts to reduce cost.
And as Mr.
Kameyama mentioned, we raised prices.
That was the biggest area in Americas, in the USA.
So, we have been recovering that.
For this year, actually.
From previous year to this year, we do have -- we cannot absorb the cost increase of 300 billion each year.
But we do have -- we have launched -- we have a new model, '20 model, year 23 model was launched in there.
So, we would somehow hope to manage absorbing those costs.
I guess you must be interested in Japan.
In Japan, we have the competitors.
We need to monitor the situation, how it plays out with others.
We will consider raising prices if there's an opportunity.
Next question.
You are -- production.
So, we said that 4.2 million units at the beginning of the fiscal year.
And then, you know, this was still -- so, well the first quarter, we had the impact from the Shanghai lockdown.
So, it was like 0.8 million.
And then we -- if we would raise both stages and then get better per quarter.
But this quarter -- sorry, the first quarter, we have to struggle with the semiconductor supply.
So, we are short by about 20,000 units or so compared to the original plan.
So, we can catch up with this.
We can cover this up with the second quarter.
And then we should be able to recover this in the second and the third quarter so that we should be able to build up.
So, we should reach 1 million in a quarter so that we can reach 4.2 total.
So, we will go gradually and then try to reach 4.2 million that was forecasted at the very beginning of the term.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Mr.
Kameyama.
Next question.
Yomiuri Shimbun.
Mr.
Nakamura, please.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Nakamura from Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.
Can you hear me?
"
3513,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,9,"[Foreign language] Yes.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Thank you.
I have two questions about the Shanghai lockdown impact.
To the extent that you can disclose, what components have been impacted? And if you're seeing some improvements, which component are you seeing improvement in? The second question, the raw material costs are continuing to rise.
But what kind of components do you see a significant impact of the raw material price increase?
"
3514,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,10,"[Foreign language] Well about the lockdown impact, which component was mostly impacted? Well, it's very difficult for me to specify any specific components because we have in Wuhan and Guangzhou factories, and there are many of the suppliers in the Shanghai area.
And many of the manufactures we're producing in Shanghai are being -- the components and subcomponents, they have all seen a reduction in production.
And this is the impact of the Shanghai lockdown.
And in June -- July, compared to the previous month, and thanks to the lifting of the lockdown, these numbers have improved, and they're in the positive.
So, I think that, overall, in China factories, because they are located in these locations, our suppliers have been impacted by the lockdown.
So, please understand that that is the case.
And about the raw material price increase rather than any specific component.
And from the past two fiscal years, the precious metal, those that have been used for catalyzers, these precious materials -- metals, these are the ones that have been impacted.
And from last fiscal to this fiscal year -- well, from last year.
In the fourth quarter of last fiscal year in North America, steel prices, because of the revision in January, we've seen a decrease of 150%.
And so, that was three months for last fiscal year and 12 months for this fiscal year.
And I think that this is the area that we're seeing a major impact.
Other raw materials, likewise, we are seeing the impact not just around materials but due to inflation.
There are increases in prices overall.
But the precious grade metals, I think, compared to the past, the increase is less.
And it's more or less plateaued, but it's not going down to the extent that it's having a positive impact on the profit.
So, from last fiscal to this fiscal year, I think the biggest impact is steel prices in North America.
That was the biggest from last fiscal year to this fiscal year.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Mr.
Nakamura.
The next questions are from Toyo Keizai, Mr.
Yokoyama, please, from Weekly Toyo Keizai.
Can you hear us, Mr.
Yokoyama?
"
3515,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,11,"[Foreign language] Yes.
Yes, we can hear your voice.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] OK.
I have two questions as well.
My first question is you announced this sales of Honda Lock to MinebeaMitsumi.
So, could you let me know the background why -- what's your aim or to background to it? And then related to that, among your subsidiaries and related companies, I guess you do have some internal combustion-related suppliers.
But are you considering some support to them while you shift to electrification? And then my second question also relates to suppliers.
So, I believe we heard about the -- well, there's a lot of cost pressure to the suppliers.
Are you thinking of any support? If you have any specific plans for that, please let us know.
"
3516,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,12,"[Foreign language] OK.
First, about Honda Lock, sales of Honda Lock, this will be from MinebeaMitsumi.
So, originally this company Honda Lock, the supplier, this is not -- is ready-to-lock.
So, keys, door mirror, those parts manufacturer rather than internal combustion-related.
But MinebeaMitsumi, they are not a dedicated automotive supplier.
But they wanted to utilize our technological advantages of a Honda group so they feel that they will be able to expand their business horizon.
So, that is why they approached us.
So, we started discussing.
So, it's nothing to do with the internal combustion suppliers at all.
So, for those suppliers related to internal combustion systems, I will -- we will like to discuss individually.
We will be discussing.
So, we would like to see what technological expertise each supplier has and what can be utilized for EV.
So, that's something up to the individual discussions.
About the price reduction, the supplier, so another manufacturer said that they are not going to try to pressure to reduce costs of suppliers.
But to us, suppliers our business partners which help us in delivering good products to our customers, of course, the raw prices that the supplier needs to buy, the prices are going up.
And then logistical costs is going up.
For example, for the -- in the States, the inflation is pushing up the labor costs as well.
So, of course, they would need -- we need to work together to enhance the efficiency and reduce costs due to competition.
But we still will need to discuss individually with the suppliers trying to take actions as appropriate and necessary with individual suppliers.
That is our approach.
So, in considering will -- we cannot really -- I cannot really say how much that will be or anything like that.
But we would like to -- so, we are saying 60 -- we are estimating cost increase that we mentioned earlier.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Yokoyama.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Next question.
Automotive News.
Mr.
Hans Greimel, please.
"
3517,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,13,"[Foreign language] Yes.
"
3518,HMC,2023,1,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,14,"[Foreign language] First question about the possibility of recession in the United States and how we tried to deal with that.
As Hans has mentioned, the United States -- it was 9.1% inflation rate last month.
And the interest rates, .75 increases continuing and by the Fed.
And also, in order to curb inflation, the interest rates are continuing to increase and eventually in North America.
I think that this will have an impact on the economy in North America.
So, we're keeping an eye on the developments.
But so far, looking at our automotive sales, with the dealers, I think we have an inventory of 20,000, which is very low inventory.
It is preorders of customers constantly.
Well, in the past, the customers would -- we would look at the inventory and tried to take orders.
But in Japan, we take orders and try to look into whether we can sell and have the customers buy and deliver the cars later -- at a later date.
So, I think that currently we have a large back order.
And we have to supply to our customers the products as soon as possible.
This is the current situation.
And therefore, with a recession month and taking immediate measures, we have to focus on delivering our cars and vehicles to our customers.
Now, if there were to be a recession, recently, due to the pandemic, we have seen a large dip in the unit sales, but we have been generating profit.
And so, I think that we have become more efficient in terms of fixed cost, etc., and we have to keep an eye on the possibility of recession.
And if necessary, we'll try to further reduce fixed costs.
About this sales price -- the selling price, for the past two fiscal years, we have been doing a number of measures.
But for North America, this fiscal year, rather than increasing the prices, our normal prices, we will increase it to the rate of inflation.
But it's not the case we are going to increase it by 9% in 2023 model year.
I think our most competitive CR-V, Accord, and also Pilot we'll see a model change.
And therefore, with the equipment, we will increase the value of our products.
And in line with the value that is being offered, we think that we can increase the price.
So, we will continue to seek for that possibility.
We will try to deliver quality good products to our customers and have our customers recognize the value of our products and accept price increase.
That is all.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Mr.

Questions & Answers:
Operator
Mr.
Masao Kawaguchi, general manager of accounting division, accounting and finance supervisory unit.
"
3520,HMC,2023,3,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,1,"First of all, I would like to thank all of our customers around the world for their loyalty to Honda products, and all the stakeholders who support Honda's efforts.
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers who are waiting for Honda products due to the current vehicle production delay.
We will do our best to deliver our products to our customers as soon as possible and seek for your understanding.
So, now explain financial results for FY 2023 third quarter and FY 2023 financial forecast.
First, the key points of our financial results.
The current business environment continues to be difficult.
In the third quarter, production and unit sales of automobiles decreased from the same period of the previous year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and semiconductor supply shortages.
In addition, manufacturing costs continued to rise due to soaring raw material prices and inflation.
Under these circumstances, Honda made companywide efforts to further improve its earnings structure and secured a 6.3% operating margin for the fiscal year '23 third quarter.
The motorcycle business posted record high operating profit and margin for the second consecutive quarter.
For the full year forecast, we have revised downward automobile unit sales.
Despite upward pressure on manufacturing costs, we will maintain our previous forecast for both operating profit and profit for the year by further improving our business structure.
Despite the unfavorable business environment, we believe our earnings structure is steadily improving.
And in light of a good profitability, cash level, and future fund requirements, the board today approved a resolution to acquire ¥70 billion of our own shares.
When added to the ¥100 billion already acquired this fiscal year, the total comes to ¥170 billion.
Honda will continue to accelerate its efforts toward electrification and new growth to enhance corporate value.
Next, I will explain the status of our automobile business in major markets.
In the first nine months of the fiscal year, unit sales in major markets declined for the same period year on year.
The third-quarter period was affected by semiconductor supply shortages and pandemic in China.
The unit sales in Japan were higher while sales in the US and China were lower than in the same period of the previous year.
In Japan, the N-Box was the No.
1 selling new car consumer, and the Freed was the number one selling minivan, for the calendar year 2022.
And in North America, the Acura Integra was named 2023 North American Car of the Year.
We have revised downward previous sales forecast for fiscal year 2023, taking into account the current production and sales condition.
In addition, we announced plan to launch a new light commercial EV in spring 2024, utilizing the features of the N-VAN.
In the U.S., we announced establishment of a joint venture with LG Energy Solutions to produce EV batteries and the signing of a basic agreement with GS Yuasa to collaborate on high-capacity, high-output lithium ion batteries.
Next, our motorcycle business.
In the first nine months, unit sales exceeded year on year in major markets.
In the third quarter, unit sales in major markets exceeded that same period last year due to the replacement of sales models, utilization of automotive parts, and the effect of new model orders, mainly in Vietnam, despite the effects of semiconductor supply shortages and other factors.
In Vietnam, unit sales reached a record high in October following September.
And in Brazil, unit sales reached 1 million units for the first time in calendar year since 2014.
We have upwardly revised previous sales forecasts for FY '23, reflecting the current strong sales trend.
As forerunners of the global launch of electric motorcycles, Honda announced the EM1 e in Europe in November and three commuter EV models in China in January.
Next, our overview of FY '23 nine months results.
Despite decrease in automobile production and unit sales due to semiconductor shortages and pandemic in China, plus higher manufacturing costs due to surging raw material prices and inflation, operating profit increased ¥62.2 billion to ¥733.9 billion year on year due to price increases commensurate with improved product value, increased motorcycle unit sales, and foreign exchange.
Profit for the year amounted to ¥583.1 billion, up ¥1 billion from the same period last year.
Unit sales and income statement are as shown.
Next, FY '23 consolidated financial forecast.
Despite declining automobile unit sales and upward cost pressure due to inflation, we are maintaining our previous forecast of ¥870 billion for operating profit, reflecting price increases commensurate with improved product value increase in motorcycle unit sales, mainly in China, and companywide efforts to further improve profitability.
The profit for the year forecast of ¥725 billion is also maintained.
Exchange rate assumptions for the fourth quarter and full year are ¥138 and ¥135 to the dollar, respectively.
Unit sales and income statement are as shown.
Next, I will cover the dividend information.
The prospects for fiscal-year dividend for fiscal year 2023 is at ¥120 per share, unchanged from our previous announcement.
At the board of directors meeting held today, we have resolved to acquire own stocks.
With the objective of enhancing capital efficiency and enabling flexible capital strategies, we will acquire own stock up to the maximum total amount of ¥70 billion.
Next, Mr.
Kawaguchi, general manager of accounting division, will explain the details of the financial results and forecast.
"
3521,HMC,2023,3,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,2,"OK.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Nabe.
Concerning the financial services operations and the states and the incentives -- OK, Mr.
Kawaguchi will cover all the details about the financial services.
For the financial services, since the pandemic started, what has been changing dramatically is that during the pandemic, the subsidies -- so far, there has been a lot of good subsidies from the government to individuals.
And then, we have not been able to provide good -- new -- I mean, new vehicles.
So, the used car market's prices has been going up.
So, in our financial services operations, there's a bit of a special factor.
There has been some impact in default and the losses of the residual value.
So, those are negative.
Risk expenses has been there.
And then, but for the past -- so, the two, three years, there has been -- the negative risk factors has been very low.
So, we used to have got ¥330 billion operating profit.
However, now, those risk factors are coming in.
So, we used to have this.
We are thinking, expecting something like ¥250 billion to ¥260 billion for throughout the year -- for the full year.
So, that is the effect that we are seeing.
So, so far, without going -- without the risk expenses, but those are now coming back.
That is the big reason behind these reduced earnings.
You have anything to add, Mr.
Kawaguchi?
"
3522,HMC,2023,3,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,3,"Mr.
Midori, thank you very much.
About the breakdown, I would like Kawaguchi to respond to your question about that.
But about the requests that we're receiving from our suppliers around their cost to the pricing and for us to accept their increase in pricing, well, this is true for ourselves as well.
But I do think that there is a big impact in various ways.
Well, recently, there's been the foreign exchange, the raw material, energy price, the personnel cost increase.
And along with the semiconductor situation, we had to reduce our production, and therefore, we have to shoulder the fixed cost more than in the past.
And we are asking the suppliers to put in place the necessary fixed asset to meet our requirements.
And therefore, I think that they are very much impacted by having to reduce their production volume.
We do recognize that this is their situation.
Well, when it comes to foreign exchange or raw material impact, within the fiscal year, we are purchasing section and the suppliers will work out and try to supplement the shortcomings.
But this year, just for this year, the energy price or, let's say, the inflation impact, production reduction impact, so all these included, we are trying to respond fully and try to support our suppliers in struggling with these challenges.
And it's not just the tier 1 suppliers or tier 2, tier 3 suppliers too, the supply chain as a whole, we are looking at how we can share the burden.
Well, each will be negotiated.
And so, I mean, our fourth quarter, I think that we -- we were thinking that a bunch of the costs will be posted in the fourth quarter.
We are diligent case by case.
And the third quarter -- we have already settled it or decided with it in the third quarter.
So, in the third quarter, in our actual numbers, the cost increases already reflected about half of the portion.
About the raw material prices included, the suppliers' cost increase.
Well, it's not really to respond to that situation, but there is a cost increase of 430 billion, of which suppliers also included.
They're having to try to deal with the supply situation in the full year.
We, our suppliers, we are trying to reduce our cost and improve our earning structure.
We, on both sides, are working on this.
And for this fiscal year, I think it will be difficult to ask them to try to work on this.
So, looking at the supply chain, we will talk with them and decide what needs to be done.
That is the situation.
And as for how much, I'll hand it over to Kawaguchi.

Operator
Then Mr.
Fujimura will first present an outline of the third-quarter financial results and the forecasts for fiscal year to March 2023.
Then Mr.
Kawaguchi will present the details.
Over to you, Mr.
Fujimura.
"
3525,HMC,2023,3,masao-kawaguchi,"general-manager,-accounting-division,-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit",False,1,"Allow me to start the explanation.
To begin with Honda Group's unit sales for nine month of the fiscal year 2023.
In motorcycle operations, unit sales grew year on year, particularly in Asia, and came to 14,285,000 units.
Automobile sales came to 2.74 million units, mainly due to decline in China and North America.
In power products operations, unit sales came to 4,121,000 units, mainly due to decline in North America.
Next, I'd like to explain the changes of our pre-tax profit for the three quarters compared to the same period last year.
Pretax profit was ¥859.3 billion, which was higher by ¥14.1 billion compared to the same period last year.
Operating profit was ¥733.9 billion, which was higher by ¥62.2 billion on the year.
To give you a factor analysis of the operating profit.
Impact from sales, though there was an increase in motorcycle unit sales, declines in automobile sales volume and in financial operations led to income decline of ¥97.1 billion.
Impact from selling price and cost, while there was a effect from our pricing in line with the product value due to surging material prices and inflation, it resulted in a decline in profit by ¥17.1 billion.
Next, expenses.
Due to increase mainly in setting expenditures and other factors, this gave us a negative impact of ¥65.6 billion.
R&D expenses led to a decline of ¥11.5 billion, and currency effect resulted in 253.7 million positive impact .
Next to explain the sales revenues and operating profit by business segment.
For motorcycles, operating profit was ¥376.5 billion.
Automobile operations profit was ¥112.9 billion.
Operating profit from financial services was ¥220.3 billion.
And for our power business and other businesses, operating profit came to ¥24.1 billion.
Next, I will explain the cash flow. Free cash flow of the operating entities for third quarter of FY '23 came to ¥217.0 billion and, at the end of the term, balance of net cash came to ¥ 2,339.3 billion.
Next, I would like to talk about the consolidated financial forecast for FY ending in 2023.
Firstly, speaking of Honda Group's unit sales, since the previous forecast, our motorcycle business, considering the growth mainly in Asia, forecast is for 18,730,000 units; in automobiles, 3.85 million units, considering the decline mainly in China; and in power products, 5.58 million units in view of the declines in Europe and in Asia.
Next, I'd like to explain the factor analysis of pre-tax profit compared to the actual results from last fiscal year.
Pretax profit is forecast at ¥1,080 billion, up ¥9.8 billion from the previous year's results.
Operating profit is forecast at almost the same level as last year's results.
To explain the factors behind the operating profit.
The impact from sales was a -5.2 billion due to reduced income in financial services.
The motorcycle unit sales group, selling price and cost impact is -¥93.0 billion due to surging material prices and inflation, though there was good effect from pricing in line with product value.
The expenses impact is expected to be -¥120.0 billion due to increase in the quality-related expenses and selling expenses.
R&D expense impact is -52.0 billion yen, and currency effect is forecast positive of ¥269.0 billion.
Next, the changes since our previous forecast.
We are keeping our pre-tax profit and operating profit forecast unchanged.
To explain the factors affecting operating profit, impact from sales is -¥47.0 billion, mainly due to decline in automobile unit sales.
Selling price and costs impact is positive ¥17.0 billion, thanks to effect from pricing in line with product value, though there is headwind of inflation adding to cost rises.
Expenses impact is +¥32.0 billion due to a decline in quality-related expenses.
R&D expense impact, a +¥15.0 billion, currency impact of -¥17.0 billion.
Lastly, since our previous forecast, our forecast for capital expenditure, depreciation, and amortization on the expenditures for FY '23 remains unchanged.
This completes my explanation.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Unknown speaker
Thank you for your listening.
And now, we'd like to proceed to questions and answers.
We have informed members of the media the procedure.
[Operator instructions] Let us begin with Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.
Mr.
Nakamura, please.
Mr.
Nakamura, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, please.
I'm Nakamura from Yomiuri Shimbun.
I have two questions.
The first, the sales in China.
I want to know the details about sales in China.
In November, due to the zero-COVID-19 policy, this plan had to be suspended.
But what is the forecast for production sales in China January to March? And also, about trying to shorten the delivery time in Japan and overseas, especially due to the shortage of semiconductors, I think that you're working to try to secure the necessary semiconductors.
But I'd like to ask you, including that area of semiconductors, how you intend to shorten your delivery lead time.
Thank you, Mr.
Nakamura, for your question.
We have received two questions.
First, about China.
Let me begin with China.
Well, as you pointed out, again, and also as explained, for the third quarter, especially October and November, due to the zero-COVID policy, the plant had to be suspended.
As well, in the coastal areas, it was the inland area of China, which was heavily impacted.
And also, we have the Dongfeng Honda plant.
It's in Wuhan, and because it's in inland area, including production, there was a big impact.
And the December, after, the government is shifting to boosting the economy.
And therefore, in regards to the restrictions of outings, the Chinese government have lifted these restrictions.
But as -- again, as a result, the number of infection cases increased.
And so, in the third quarter, well, compared to original plan, in regards to China, we were short of 120,000 units.
Of course, there is also the semiconductor impact included here.
Now, in regards to the fourth quarter and January-March quarter, well, we came up with the January numbers recently.
And due to the pandemic and others that some of the dealers were closed, and there was, to a certain extent, the impact of those sales.
And also, due to the Chinese Lunar New Year and also the car acquisition tax, there was a tax reduction, but this was ended in the end of December.
And therefore, in January, year on year compared to last year, it is around 50%.
But in regards to these factors, we had factored them in our plan.
And at February, in the spring, we will be able to resolve these impacts.
We were looking at the market developments last year in calendar year 2022 in China.
The passenger car market -- we are not involved very much in commercial vehicles.
So, talking about passenger car market, it was around 33.5 million units.
And into year '23, we are expecting it to be more or less the same.
And given that, the breakdown would change.
So, we believe that there will be growth in the new energy cars, and they will have a share of 30, 40%, and seeing a growth of 130%.
And so how are we going to compete, given this situation.
The N-Series, well, we launched the series last year, and it is still -- we also have ICE, internal combustion gasoline engines.
So, we will have to compete with these.
And of course, CR-V, highly appraised, and therefore, we want to ensure that these can be produced, and we want to cover with that and also for electrification.
The N-Series -- the second of the series will be launched within FY '24, and also Honda Connect.
And we look on the intelligence.
Honda SENSING 360, these will be evolved so that by FY '27 we will have 10 EVs in the market.
So, that is our situation in China.
And about the deliveries, both in Japan and overseas, the impact of semiconductor shortage, I said that, in China, there was also the impact of the pandemic.
We had to reduce it by 210,000 from the plan.
But other than China, again, we have 40,000.
So, in total, 250,000 reduction.
About the impact of this 40,000 units, given the markets, U.S., North America is a big factor.
And well, relatively speaking, North America, when it comes to the price range of the vehicles, well, the vehicles will come with a lot of equipment which require semiconductors.
And therefore, North America is more impacted by this shortage.
But in Japan and Asia, and including the measures that we're taking, we are increasing our units still.
So, the semiconductor impact, well, we initially we're planning for 4.2 million, but is now 3.8 million units.
We are trying to manage the situation on a daily basis.
And so, if we miss even a single component, we cannot produce.
Therefore, together with our suppliers, as well as the semiconductor suppliers, we are directly communicating with them to try to address this issue.
Well, it is a very challenging situation.
About the third quarter, well, excluding the pandemic in China, compared to the second quarter, we have been increasing unit sales.
And compared to last year's third quarter, the unit volume is increasing.
So, we think that we are starting to see the situation bottom out.
From the second half of this year, the supply will recover.
We are expecting that to happen.
So, this is the image that we hope.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Nakamura.
Let's take the next question.
OK.
From Nikkei newspaper, Mr.
Nabe.
OK.
This is Nabe from Nikkei paper.
I hope you can hear me.
Yes, I can.
Please go ahead.
OK.
Thank you.
Your financial services business, so recently, from October to December, you saw some declines in your profit.
So, I'd like to know the reasons.
That's my first question.
My second question is for the states.
I would like to ask about the whole industry.
I believe that the incentives are actually coming to the bottom.
So, from January to March, I wonder what you expect the incentives to go from here? Well, the word recession is a mention.
So, I just want to ask how you see the demand in the states.
"
3526,HMC,2023,3,masao-kawaguchi,"general-manager,-accounting-division,-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit",False,2,"OK.
Mr.
Nabe, thank you for the question.
As Mr.
Fujimura explained the overview of our financing services business, as he said, if we look just at the three quarters -- third quarter compared with the third quarter last year, we have lost about 14 million operating -- in the operating profit.
Two big factors for this.
One is that, as Mr.
Fujimura explained, those are default.
Those are losses associated with the default as well.
To repeat myself, last fiscal year, in the States particularly, we had a very good business with the government subsidies.
So, without -- the defaulting percentage was very low.
But now those subsidies, because the pandemic came to -- coming to an end, those subsidies are coming to an end so the normal defaulting ratio has been coming back.
However, in case of Honda, the customers -- we have -- thankfully, we have many customers who have a very high credit score.
So, compared to the general increases in defaulting, it is not that we are getting the same level of delinquencies or default.
So, it is a gradual increase in the defaulting percentage, fortunately.
And another thing is that the credits of the loans, this balance itself is declining.
So, the loans or the leasing, we have the interest income from them to the customers.
So, currently, if our lending credit has been declining, that means our revenues are declining.
So, the financial revenues and so is the income has been going down.
So, due to the semiconductor and the pandemic, we -- the states in general, the retail segment has been very struggling.
So, the credits that we have been providing to consumers, the lending, those are kind of expiring.
And then, now, we are getting our reduced number of loans and lending.
So, the lending volume has been going down.
So, those are the two factors that contribute to this.
OK.
Thank you then.
Let me try to answer the second question about the incentives.
As you said, those are hitting their bottom.
I would say that is what we see.
So, we are struggling with the semiconductor situation.
We do have a good demand.
However, we are not able to catch up with the supply.
So, at the dealers, the inventory at the dealers has been very low, generally speaking.
So even if you look at the other OEMs across the market, there has been a situation.
However -- but the American and Korean OEMs, they are getting rid of that situation.
They are getting -- they're building up their inventory.
So, due to -- maybe due to the impact, we are seeing that the incentive has bottomed out and then is going -- looking to increase.
So, we are assuming that this situation will continue.
But for ourselves, initially, before the pandemic, we were thinking of like 60 days' worth of dealer inventory.
That's what we used to keep, but we wanted to minimize -- running at minimizing the inventory dealer.
When it comes to keeping down the incentives, this is something that American Honda believes in.
And the dealers in the states that we work with, they understand the situation that this leads to keeping down the incentive.
So, we don't -- want to make sure that we don't bring up the inventory level at the dealers to the previous level.
And at the same time, of course, for a model, there would be some situation where the incentive would need to be raised.
However, we want to avoid that situation.
We have been trending at the lowest level of incentive originally, so we want to try to keep it even more than the efforts that we used to put into this before.
I hope those answered your question.
Unknown speaker
Thank you, Mr.
Nabe.
Next question, NHK, Mr.
Toma.
This is Toma from NHK speaking.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Can you speak a bit louder?
This is Toma from NHK.
About your operating profit of the automobile business, well, you have a margin of 1.4%.
And compared to last year, it's low.
What are the reasons and how will you try to improve? What are your policies going forward? That's the first one.
And related to that, the price increase of your automobile models, can you talk about possible price increase?
Toma-san, thank you.
About operating margin at 1.4%, yes, as you mentioned, it is quite low.
We do recognize this to be low.
Well, the operating profit -- or the operating margin of automobile business, the fact that it's low, well, it's after the Lehman shock, and we were struggling.
And we had this a goal of achieving 6 million worldwide.
And we started up our factory, but we could not achieve that level.
And therefore, to now, we had to decide to close down some of our plants.
And about profitability of new models, again, it was pointed out that it's not increasing.
We want to try to have common parts globally and also improve the profitability of the respective models.
So, as for our plants in Europe, as well as in Japan, Saitama factory, Sayama plant, we have reduced the fixed cost for new models recently from last year's.
Civic Accord, CR-V, HR-V, Pilot, our core models, being renewed.
So, I think in terms of our profitability, we have put in a lot of new measures and come this far.
As for a capacity, well, I said that we were aiming for 6 million units globally is currently 5.14 million.
But regretfully, due to the semiconductor and the pandemic situation, it is less than 4 million right now but at around 70% of what we are aiming toward, with the 5.14.
Well, this 1.4% operating margin is low.
And so, we have to think about how -- first, how to secure the necessary semiconductors so as to improve our top line.
But despite this very low utilization rate of our plants, we have managed to come this far.
And about the price increase question that you asked, it will be coming up later.
Over the past two years, we have had a cost increase impact of 700 billion over the past two years.
And we have to take measures to cope with that.
And so, with these factors all combined have resulted in operating margin of 1.4%.
We have to try to increase the margin, we understand.
About the price increase of our automobile models, the way to think about it -- well, about the price increase, we avoid using the term price increase.
Instead, as we explained, we tried to try to price it commensurate with the product value.
And so, what we are thinking here is that the car and the service, that we have to focus on how our customers will appreciate the value.
So, this is a first factor that will be important.
And we need to try to enable our customers to recognize the value of our products or service.
And we need to offer such products and services that our customers would appreciate.
Now, how are we going to increase the price? It really depends on the market.
It depends on the model.
So, a number of factors are involved here.
And in the field, we will be very careful and prudent in setting the prices.
About inflation, well, it was not because of inflation that we want to increase the price.
But to our customers, in order to explain how we are prudent about increasing prices in regards to our automobiles, well, there are cases in which we would rather cut -- reduce the price.
Well, rather, if we were to reduce it, it will lead to reducing the price of used cars.
It's not just new customers, but existing customers who are already using our models, we would undermine the asset value of these vehicles.
And therefore, as I said, we are trying to keep the incentives to the lowest in the industry.
So, including that, we have to try to protect the value of our customers' assets.
This is something that we also need to take into consideration.
And therefore, for our customers to agree to not just buy a new Honda, but we also have to attach importance to our existing customers who are using our products.
And with this in mind, we want to deter with this pricing.
These are the thoughts that we have in regards to this subject.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
Toma.
OK.
We'd like to move on to the next question.
From Automotive News, over to you, Hans.
"
3527,HMC,2023,3,masao-kawaguchi,"general-manager,-accounting-division,-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit",False,3,"Midori-san, thank you for the question.
About the full year, well, the slide that you saw earlier and also the selling price cost impact, -93 billion.
About the raw material, steel, aluminum, and also the precious metal catalysts, these are the areas in which we're seeing quite a bit of an impact. To break down, precious metal, from last year -- well, especially recently, [Inaudible] budget volume of their market is something that is how we see it.
And the semiconductor impact is easy.
And once the production increases and the situation might change, we do think that might happen.
But just as of now, we think, for the precious metal pricing, is the market is softening.
Steel, aluminum, ever since last year, we have seen quite a bit of increase in price.
And this has had impact on our business.
About the full year, -93 billion, and this explanation -- well, as Fujimura has already said, the overall cost is 430 billion, and this is included.
And so, we are trying to make effort to reduce the cost and also to try to price in line with product value.
So, through such efforts, we have tried to cover for this, but still, we have this 93 billion.
Now the 430 billion raw material cost increase, also, as I explained, the suppliers, we can negotiate and talk with our suppliers and try to shoulder some of their cost, so that will increase our cost.
And the labor costs, logistics costs, inflationary impact all included.
Now, this 430 billion, well, raw material -- just looking about the raw material, about 200 billion would be the portion that accounts for the raw material part.
And of about the three -- nine months period, well, I said, of the 430 billion earlier, which 250 billion-plus has already been realized over these nine months.
And raw material impact is about 150 billion-plus.
I hope I understand that that is the case.
That is all.
Thank you.
Unknown speaker
Thank you very much, Mr.
Midori.
We'd like to take the next question from -- Mr.
Yokohama, please.
This is Yokohama.
I hope you can hear me.
Yes, please.
Over there.
OK.
I have two questions as well.
It's about your production planning, I would like to hear about your forecast.
So, of course, for this year, you have shown the volume, but you talked about the semiconductors.
So, for the next fiscal year, in what direction you will be heading with the production plan, including your countermeasures and all that? So, Toyota said that 10.6 million units and then that will be the guideline.
And then -- so I'd like to hear what Honda is thinking about.
And then, about the deterioration in profitability for automobile business, this was asked earlier.
If the unit volume goes up, I guess the profitability deterioration might get worse.
And I just would like to know what your prospects are for next business here onwards.
OK.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Yokoyama.
About our production plans, our forecast -- well, I hope that we can head toward this capacity of 5.4 million units, but I guess that would be difficult, I would say.
So, we talked about the three-quarter results.
So, the impact of COVID in China, so that consists of -- it is very difficult to split up into the impact from pandemic on semiconductor.
But I would say -- I'd say the 210,000 units -- reduction, I'd say, more than half -- the majority would have been pandemic.
So, I would say, for this fiscal year, that would be the 4 million units or so, and then the 4 million units would be the bottom.
So, how much we can build on top of it, that's the plan we have for the next business year. That's what we are thinking of.
So, exactly what kind of numbers we can build up for that, in May, we will talk about the forecast for next fiscal year.
So, by then, we should be able to tell you something more.
And in terms of actions or countermeasures, we have been making a lot of -- thinking a lot of actions.
So, development of alternative components and parts and then for alternative parts.
Concerning semiconductor, we -- one thing, we have been relying on analog semiconductors to keep the costs reasonable.
But even if those are more interchangeable, you know, we would go for -- even for higher cost and then build.
We want to build as many cars as possible.
So, we want to develop alternative parts while using -- relying on that type of parts.
And then, we will try to coordinate with suppliers as well.
That's what we have been doing.
And then, at the early stage, we are communicating our production plan to the suppliers so that they can expect to secure certain parts volume.
That's something we have been doing already, but we would like to reinforce that kind of efforts together to try to work out the production plan for next fiscal year onwards.
And concerning this, as the volume goes up, well, what is going to happen? I mean, profitability, how much that's going to go up by? As I said, are we consider 4 million units as the bottom.
And then we are thinking of how much on top of it we can build up.
So, this is only assumption.
So, at this point in time, I would prefer to refrain from speaking of it.
I hope we can show you something more solid in May.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
Yokohama.
I apologize, but due to the time limit, the next question will be the last.
Last question.
[Inaudible], please.
This is [Inaudible].
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Thank you.
I also would like to ask about the semiconductor situation.
Well, it might be a bit redundant, but once again, the first question is, well, I think you said that you are -- because you communicate with semiconductor manufacturers.
But what specifically are you going to talk about, and what do you think will be effective? Are there any exchanges that you can share with us? And second, about the future outlook.
Well, the last announcement and this announcement, you, again, have repeated the shortage of semiconductors.
Now, from November, I think that the shortage content, the amount of content might be different.
And things might be improving in some places, or the types of semiconductors that are in short supply might be changing.
And can you explain about that and what solutions that you have in mind to try to resolve this situation?
Unknown Speaker
Ms.
[Inaudible], thank you very much.
You want us to give you some more specifics.
Well, we -- when it comes to components delivery, we have been talking with tier 1 manufacturers.
We've lifted them to work on the situation.
But when it comes to semiconductors, tier 1 suppliers, they have to procure the components and assemble and deliver to us.
And this process -- with the lead time that is required for that.
In the case of semiconductors production -- manufacturing, the lead time is not very long, and therefore, we cannot just impose our requirements on tier 1 manufacturers.
We have to show understanding toward their situation.
So, it's not possible to just make demands.
And so, it is going to be several months, a year, or two years.
I really cannot give you a definite answer.
But given the nature of the semiconductor, the lead time that is required, I think about what sort of information we should be providing them.
And analog semiconductors, well, in terms of our shortage, we do have a shortage of such semiconductors.
And the manufacturers, though, would find it difficult.
Well, they -- I don't think that they will decide on their own to invest in such capacity.
So, we have to share our troubles and to talk about what can be done so -- that through that we can build up a relationship with our suppliers.
So, I think that that is a sort of exchange that we hope to be effective.
Now, about the outlook.
Well, when we announced from November, well, ever since that time, excluding China, it's -4 million -- 40,000 rather, sorry.
So, it -- well, compared to plant, well -- and Japan and Asia is a plus, where -- others is a minus.
And on the third quarter, for North America, compared to the second quarter or the previous year, we saw a positive.
Well, in January, we have seen a positive increase and the market growth was greater than that of Honda's.
So, I think that we are starting to see some good signs.
How can we resolve going forward? The measures that I explained will have to be taken one by one.
I think that is the only thing that we could do.
But to fully resolve, I think it will take some more time.
I think it will start to improve in the second half of FY '24.
I think that we will start to see better procurement of semiconductors around that time.
Thank you, Ms.
[Inaudible].

It's about your dealer strategy in the United States with Sony Honda mobility.
It seems to be a somewhat sensitive issue with Honda dealers there.
Your Honda dealers and Acura dealers seem to assume that they will have automatic rights almost to start selling Sony Honda EVs.
But the Sony Honda Mobility joint venture doesn't seem to agree necessarily with that.
What is Honda's position on maybe giving its own dealers an advantage or a priority in selling -- or I should say, servicing or aftermarket business with Sony Honda Mobility?
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Thank you very much, Hans.
For Sony Hondo Mobility, about the fusion of Sony and Honda, those are -- we come from different industries.
So, this is an unprecedented idea.
This is a new mobility value that we alone cannot come up with.
So, it's something innovative.
So, we do have high expectations of this as we started with the joint venture and then as the project proceeds.
But I'm sorry, I have to say this.
But see, the Honda Sony Mobility's vehicle business and Honda's business, they can become competitors depending on the market where the joint venture dealer or our business work.
So, they would have to -- there are rules and policies and regulations about sales and competition.
So, we cannot talk about the Honda Sony Mobility's products and services, what will be made available and, as you have asked, what kind of sales strategy will be adopted.
I'm sorry to say that we are unable to answer the question, so I hope you will appreciate our position on this.
Thank you very much, Hans.
From Yomiuri Shimbun, Mr.
Midori, please.
This is Midori speaking.
How do you do? Two questions.
So, about the nine months and the full year, the operating profit and -- well, you talked about the gains and losses and the selling price and cost and you said -- I want to know -- and also the material cost.
So, can you explain the details of how much increase and also give the breakdown? And another question is -- I might be asking the same question every time -- but the suppliers, I think I'm looking at their performance and they are also having difficulties.
And so, the suppliers, are they not requesting that you try to add on their additional cost on the pricing? So, are you not receiving such a great question? Are you satisfying their request?

3532,HMC,2023,2,river-davis,reporter,False,0,"Hello.
Thank you very much for taking my question.
I have one follow-up on semiconductors.
We're hearing from some other automakers that they feel like they've made it past the worst of the shortages.
Is that similar in Honda's view at the moment? And my second question is on electrification.
A few weeks ago, we heard from General Motors that they're pushing back some of their EV timelines because they're having trouble ramping up battery capacity.
Is Honda seeing any impact from that issue, especially with regard to jointly developed vehicles and timelines around those? Thank you.
Unknown Speaker
So, semiconductor question, whether or not the worst time has been over, I think from the [Inaudible] high level, the worst shortest period of the semiconductor at large has been gone -- has gone for general use of semiconductor.
However, we have different types of semiconductors and there's different applications in vehicles and so on where the matching are well supported.
The worst time has been over, but still, some specific areas, we still have the shortage.
I don't think we have passed the worst time for the specific application area of the semiconductors.
So, we try to address the situation so that we can make a delivery of the products to the customers as soon as we can and, of course, to optimize our production and delivery situations.
We are working on that, and also, electrification with GM and EV timeline or delays at this moment.
So, we have a program with GM after 2025.
We have two vehicle plans with GM with their suppliers.
And with that particular run, battery production capacity is not going to affect -- we haven't heard of that yet.
And, well, all of the GM vehicles be electrified, I don't know if that is the case.
They might need a battery.
So, as many as those.
And then, we haven't heard, and I don't know how they can say that, but that is our response.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much, Ms.
Davis.
And next [Inaudible] please.
Unknown Speaker
[Inaudible] from [Inaudible] Can you hear me?
Yes.
Thank you.
About the raw material cost, that's my first question.
The fuel costs and inflation you mentioned.
Well, what is the outlook? What do you think the situation will be? Is it going to stop? The rise will stop, or is it likely to continue to rise in the next fiscal year? I think this will have an impact on your profitability for automobiles.
So, what is your outlook forecast for inflation going forward? And the second about some numbers, a very detailed question.
Well, looking at the end of September, I think that you have a positive for the operating profit, but the net profit is a negative.
So, where it is -- what is the cause of this negative?
Yes.
Let me explain about the raw material part and also the logistics cost, inflation, what is the outlook.
Well, yes, it depends on the material.
But, well, for example, the rare metal, etc., for the past few years, a few months, it is not rising, but it's showing a slight downturn.
So, I think that this is reflected in, partially, the forecast.
But is it going to dramatically decline? Well, it depends on the material, the raw material we're talking about.
But those raw materials for batteries, I think the supply is not sufficient, and therefore, I cannot say anything about that.
But other raw materials, if the currency situation would continue, I think the rise will be more gradual.
But still, will we see a dramatic decrease in the near future? Well, depending on the material as electrification progresses, I think of the production balance, etc., the demand and supply balance, and price to do it.
So, at this point in time, there might be some changes, but we have to capture those changes early on so that we can provide good products to our customers.
And that is how we would address this issue.
About the operating profit about the first six months -- I think you're asking about the first six months, about the operating profit.
Well, really, it is a positive.
But the reason for the negative is the nonoperating profit, and also, for this year, profit investments are accounted for using equity method.
Now, for the first time, I think that the interest rate and exchange rate is volatile.
And Honda Finance, so, they are doing the procurement of funding.
And so, the derivative -- we have hedged, and the assessment of the hedge, etc.
is one of the negative factors.
So, this is a nonoperating profit.
And as for the share profit investment accounted for using the equity method, well in China, well, the business is -- rather than the business per se, positive or negative recently, the share prices are declining.
And therefore, we have the balance sheet based on the equity method.
But if we could compare this to the share prices and those what we assess using the equity method, if the share price -- if there is a gap, we have to do the -- write it off.
And therefore -- and that is the reason why we have a negative for the net profit.

Thank you very much, Mr.
[Inaudible] Next question, Automotive News, Hans-san, please.

3534,HMC,2023,2,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,0,"How do you do? I am Fujimura.
Operator
I would like to ask Takeuchi to first announce the FY '23 second quarter financial results and FY '23 forecast, followed by Fujimura, who will give the details on the above.
Mr.
Takeuchi, the floor is yours.
"
3535,HMC,2023,2,eiji-fujimura,head-of-accounting-and-finance-supervisory-unit,False,1,"Let me explain.
Honda Group's cumulative unit sales until the second quarter FY 2023 were as follows.
Motorcycle business has 9.2 million units sold, mainly with incremental sales in Asian countries year on year.
And automobile business has 1.785 million units due to the decline in sales in North America.
And power products business has -- it was a 2.935 million units due to decline in North America.
Next, let me explain factors behind the ups and downs of our profit before income tax for the first two quarters year on year.
The profit before taxes were 515.8 billion yen, a 44.5 billion decline year on year.
Operating profit was a 453.4 billion yen, up by 11.2 billion yen year on year.
Excluding factors of foreign currency impact, the profit was practically negative by 141.9 billion yen.
The breakdown is as follows.
Regarding impact on sales, profit declined by 100.1 billion due to reduction in unit sales, changes in model mix, and this -- profit decline in financial businesses.
Regarding impact on retail prices and cost, there were impacts by surging raw materials prices and product pricing, reflecting product value improvements.
However, the profit increased by 8.2 billion yen.
Regarding our miscellaneous expenses, profit declined by 41.9 billion yen due to quality-related costs.
And regarding research and development expenditures, profit declined by 8.2 billion yen.
In terms of sales revenues and operating profits in each of the business categories, operating profit in motorcycle business was 224.7 billion.
And of the -- automotive businesses' OP was 63.5 billion.
And our financial services businesses, it was 153 billion yen.
Out of the automobile and financial services businesses combined, the operating profit associated with the automobile sales is estimated to be 211.3 billion yen when aggregated together.
Next, operating profit of the power products and other businesses was 12 billion yen, which include operating losses of the aircraft and the aircraft engine businesses being 12 billion yen.
Next, I'll explain about cash flow situations.
Free cash flow of the nonfinancial services businesses was 153.3 billion yen.
Net cash at the end of the second quarter was 2,560,900,000,000 yen.
Let me talk about our forecast of our consolidated business performance for FY 2023.
With regard to the Honda Group's unit sales in the motorcycle business as compared to the previous forecast, the expected unit sales will be 18.43 million, mainly reflecting the flood in Pakistan and demand decline in China and so on.
When consolidated, we expect unit sales to be 12.02 million units, up by 360,000 units, reflecting a good sales performance in countries such as India and Vietnam.
Unit sales expected in our automobile business would be 4.1 million, mainly reflecting a decline in North America.
For power products businesses, we maintain the previous forecast of 5.665 million units.
Next, I'll explain factors behind our ups and downs of profit before income tax as compared to the results from last year.
We expect the profit before tax to be 1,80,000,000,000 yen, up by 9 billion yen year on year, and operating profit to be around the same level from the results of the last fiscal year.
Excluding foreign currency impacts, we expect negative profits of 287.2 billion, of which the breakdown was as follows.
For the impact of the sales, profit will be increasing by 41.8 billion yen due to unit sales increase of motorcycles and automobiles.
Regarding retail price and cost impact, profit will decline by 110 billion due to soaring raw materials prices and so on.
Regarding miscellaneous expenses area, our profit would decline by 152 billion due to incremental sales and quality-related cost.
For research and development expenditures category, we expect the profit to drop by 67 billion.
Comparing our new expectations to the previous forecast, the difference is as follows.
Profit before income taxes will be up, revised by 40 billion -- operating profit to be revised by 40 billion yen.
Excluding foreign currency impact, we expect -- we expect a negative profit of 80 billion yen, for which breakdowns are regarding our sales impact, down by 128 billion yen mainly due to unit sales decline in automobiles.
And in the area of the retail price and cost impact, although some cost increases are expected due to inflation impact, we will manage price pressure in good practices to reflect enhanced product values to add profits by 36 billion yen.
Regarding research and development expenditures, we expect the profit to go up by 16 billion.
Finally, [Inaudible] depreciation and amortization, as well as R&D spending for FY 2023, we revised the previous expectations to reflect the currency impact.
That concludes my explanation.
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Thank you very much.
Thank you for the attention.
And now, we'll proceed to Q&A.
We have informed the media beforehand, we will take questions soon.
And in the interest of time, we kindly ask you to limit your questions to two per person.
We seek for your cooperation.
[Operator instructions] We'd like to go [Inaudible]
Unknown Speaker
My name is [Inaudible] from [Inaudible] newspaper.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
I have two questions.
First, well, currently, we're seeing a depreciation of the yen.
And this has boosted your profit.
But can -- in order to maximize your benefit when it comes to production and procurement, what kind of ideas will you come up with? Honda localizes its production, but are you making any changes to your approach? The second question, worldwide, there is a concern of a recession at your major markets, US and China.
How do you see the prospect of the economy?
All right, Mr.
Mizushima.
With -- with regard to your exchange rate question, as you rightly mentioned, we do have the policy of producing where the demand exists.
This is a basic policy.
That is how we have set up our production sites.
And so, it's locally produced and locally consumed, meaning that we are -- well, of course, given the major fluctuation in the currency rate, it does have an impact to a certain extent.
But compared to other manufacturers exporting from Japan, compared to those major manufacturers, I don't think the impact is that big.
Well, having said that, still, I have to explain the currency impact of the US denominated only.
If there's 1 yen, there is a difference of the current situation, there is a swing of 10 billion.
It used to be 12 billion, but it's now 10 billion, which half is the export of components or the royalty we see from overseas.
So, it's mainly cash flow.
And also, we generate profit overseas and we convert this in Japanese yen.
In that conversion, we have a half of the difference.
So, that is the impact of currency.
But as for the yearly forecast, we are estimating that 135 yen against the dollar.
And so, this would be an impact of 120 billion yen in profit.
But still, the supply chain, we have suppliers and others relationship.
So, it's not the case that we can immediately shift our production to Japan.
Basic philosophy is to produce where the demand exists would remain in place.
That's in regard to your currency question.
And about the US and China's economy.
Well, as -- well, the midterm election is being -- the vote count is underway right now in the United States.
Given the 8% inflation, continuing toward the end of the year, as everyone says, there is likely an impact on the economy.
So, we also share that concern.
But if we look at the current situation, our car supply, well, for certain months due to the shortage of semiconductors, we have lost some unit sales, but the customers are waiting for our products.
So, looking at the current situation in regards to our customers, we believe that the cars we produce will be purchased by our customers.
But economically, as is being said, the interest rate increase and inflation occurring, and therefore, there will be some impact to a certain extent.
And keep this in mind, we will continue with our operation.
Likewise, in China, there -- the Chinese GDP compared to a few years ago is declining, but automobiles, annually, the passenger car is about 23 million units per annum.
In line with that, especially the market -- electrification, well, last month also -- this month, we see 20% or 19% ratio.
And therefore, we have this EV car on the market and the first one.
So, we have announced the second.
We are focused on electrification, and we want to meet our customers' demands also in China.
And this is how we want to market our products in China.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much, Mr.
[Inaudible] So, next question [Inaudible] newspaper, Mr.
Nakamura, please.
Unknown Speaker
Nakamura from [Inaudible] newspaper.
Can you hear me? Two questions.
First of all, sales, the price increases in oversees and also potential price increases in Japan, please share with me the potential.
And Japan and South Asia markets are good, and what is reason behind, and how long do you think it would continue on going forward? The motorcycle business.
So, thank you for your question.
Pricing, retail price situations, and the pricing reflecting the product values, that's how we call it.
And in the U.S., including inflation situations, we are -- we're repricing that to reflect our values of the product, of course.
Raw materials price is soaring, and those safety equipments are rearranged as well, including all that.
People buy the products.
And in the U.S., the stock level is quite low, including that situation.
We try to price the products in appropriate level for them to buy.
And in Japan, when we have such a soaring raw material prices, of course, that has the impact on the revenue.
However, we also have a sort of relationship with our, like, competitors.
The peer companies in the same industries, we look at how they are reacting, and if necessary, we would do repricing -- increasing the prices.
But at this moment in Japan, we do not have a specific information as of today.
And as for the motorcycle situations, thankfully, in the second quarter, the motorcycle business performance was very good.
Specifically, the best area is Asia markets.
Specifically, Vietnam, Thailand, number of the units sold was very good, which gave -- gave us additional revenue.
And how long would that continue? Well, as of now, without any economic turmoils or declines for this term, Thai and Vietnamese market will continue as it is, perhaps.
And also, for the motorcycle businesses, we have EV electrification plans for India and other countries toward.
In India, there's -- excuse me -- in Indonesia, from 2030 and '35 and including that, we will try to come up with appropriate pricing and so forth for the electrification plans with the motorcycle.
Thank you.
Operator
Next question.
OK [Inaudible] please.
Unknown Speaker
[Inaudible] Can you hear me?
Yes.
Well, about automobile, about the unit sales price forecast in North America, you said that it's been reduced.
Well, I think there might be some differences in the semiconductor shortage depending on the region.
So, what about Japan and North America and Asia? Can you give some regional differences? And do you think that this is likely to continue? What is likely to happen in the next fiscal year? That's the first question.
The second question is about the way of thinking toward the exchange rate.
Well, it's contributed to the profit to quite an extent.
But if this continues the longer, I think there might be some challenges ahead.
So, can you candidly share with us how you assess the currency forecast?
Thank you very much [Inaudible] First, about the units -- the automobile units, due to the shortage of semiconductors, we have downward revised by 100,000 units in U.S.
And we are trying to catch up here in Japan and Asia.
But it's a 100,000 unit downward revision.
As I already explained earlier, it is a specific type of semiconductor that has this issue with -- semiconductor and it has an impact on our CR-V, Civic.
And so, for these specific models, we have seen this impact of the shortage in the second quarter, and this was the situation.
In North America in the second half of the year, we think that will be difficult to increase the production.
So, therefore, it's difficult for us to catch up.
And this is a downward revision for U.S.
What about China? When it comes to China, naturally, the first half, there was the impact.
By the second half, the production system is such that we think that we can catch up.
And therefore, we think that we can catch up.
Meanwhile, in Asia -- you mentioned about Asia, Indonesia, etc.
The numbers are growing, and therefore, as I said, it's not -- well, the cars in Asia are relatively small.
So, for the smaller cars, there are the semiconductors available, so we can catch up there.
But the supply of semiconductors this fiscal year, we have inconvenienced our customers to quite an extent we apologize about.
There, well, the old semiconductors sometimes experience a shortage, so we have to try to observe carefully.
And we need to monitor carefully the situation because there are some abrupt incidents occurring in the supply.
Now, about the currency situation, as I've already explained, we believe that we should be producing where the demand exists.
Therefore, the currency impact is limited.
But given the fluctuation occurring in such a short period of time, this volatility does have an impact.
We cannot hedge against this.
We need to have a currency where there is long-term stability.
That is all.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, Mr.
[Inaudible] Next question [Inaudible] Ms.
[Inaudible] please.
Ms.
[Inaudible] please. 
Unknown Speaker
Thank you very much.
[Inaudible] speaking.
Thank you.
Two questions.
First one, operating profit of automobile businesses as compared to last year is a little bit lower.
And as you said before, of course -- do you have any additional explanations at the top of the presentation about this? In what situation can you expect the OP to go up? And the second question is about electrification.
The Ohio plant will be the hub for EV production, and there is the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, there.
But how do you take the benefits of the Ohio electrification production hub?
So, operating profit, automobile was rather lower as compared to last year.
And as you said, one is semiconductor supplies.
Because of that, a number of the units have to be constrained.
That is the big factor.
And also OP automobile have to be improved.
And in the last two or three years, we've been making efforts to push it up, which is reducing our fixed cost, closure of the plants in Europe and Japan and so forth.
And those are materializing and it's affected.
We have our Honda architecture-specific designs and so on or specification to make battery efficiency.
The numbers are reflecting those efforts.
However, in terms of the unit sales, it's not yet there because of the semiconductor constraints.
We are still in the process of improvements.
The numbers still be restraints, and of course, there are hypothetical situations as well.
And we're on track, in fact, toward the unit sales improvements.
And the Ohio electrification hub, you mentioned the IRA.
And 700 -- 750 -- $7,500, and $3,750, and so on according to IRA.
There are still details to be decided, but we will produce batteries with LG.
And we have two plants, Marysville and our East Liberty plants in Ohio.
And those places will be a hub for EV products.
And, of course, the principle is to make production where the demands exist, and this is working well.
And also, we have to take the benefits from the IRA incentive plants.
Thank you.
And next question, please.
NHK, Mr.
[Inaudible]
[Inaudible] Can you hear? Excuse me.
This is [Inaudible] from NHK.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Thank you.
First, I'm looking at the numbers announced.
The sales revenue, I thought it was record high, and there was a record high, if any.
Can you elaborate? And which part was the record high in terms of the record -- sales revenue.
And about the profit -- operating profit, I don't think it's a record high.
But what are the reasons cost-wise, and what cost was increased? Can you explain? That's the first part.
And second question about support to suppliers.
And can you elaborate on what you're thinking about giving support to the suppliers?
Mr.
[Inaudible] thank you for the question.
First, in regards to the sales revenue, this time, the FY '23 forecast; and the second quarter, three months, and the first half, six months, oh -- recorded a record high, but it was made attributable to the currency.
And in terms of unit value, it was not a record high.
So -- so, we really did not say proudly that this was record high.
And so, due to that, the unit sales was not high.
It was mainly attributable to the currency, and therefore, the operating profit was not a record high.
But the two -- second quarter, three months, the motorcycle profit margin was 70% or more -- our operating margin, 70% or more.
So, this is a very high number.
How about the supplier support?
Yes.
Well, we also in this FY '23 forecast compared to last fiscal year, there is a rise in the raw material price and also the logistics and inflation, etc.
So, the inflation part is having an impact significantly on the cost.
And supply is likewise experiencing the same pressure.
And, well, in line with the situation, the different suppliers, we consult with them and think about what needs to be done.
So, it's not the case where all the supplies will be provided the same support, but we have to tailor to the different situations of the suppliers.
We consult with them and to provide, if necessary, support or take other measures.
So, we have to decide for each case.
That is all.
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker
Well, as we're questioning in English, can I, sir?
"
3539,HMC,2023,2,hans-greimel,editor,False,2,"[Foreign language] My question is about the EV strategy in the United States, specifically with regard to the EV partnership with Sony.
Can you give us any new guidance on how Honda plans to approach the retailing of those EVs in the United States? Will Honda use its existing retail network to support the sales of those Sony Honda EVs, or will it be completely -- or I should say, sales and servicing of those EVs? Or will it need some kind of different and -- and independent servicing network? Thank you very much.
Unknown Speaker
[Foreign language] So, Sony and Honda joint venture has kicked off, established in September.
And the other -- they -- music company and Takeuchi-san made a joint announcement together and how we can sell the products.
Of course, with that framework, we're going to -- we have established a new joint venture company, Mobility, that will be not Honda, not Sony, but it will be a new Mobility.
That is why we established a new company.
And then, how we are going to sell, it is not defined as of yet.
Clearly, so, I can't share with you at the moment.
And using the existing grid network may not be the case.
However, service network, we have 1,000 Honda and 300 [Inaudible] service network -- 1,000 Honda and 300 [Inaudible] service network across U.S.
We make use of that.
However, the way to sell may be, you know, in line with the new kind of mobility, new world, completely new things.
So, personally, I think it is going to be something new.
But all those things are still under contemplation, so, I don't think I can refer to that today.
But it is going to be nonconventional, no Sony, no Honda, something totally new.
And that is how we have started up with this joint venture company.
So, please expect us for the next move.
Thank you, Hans-san.
Operator
Next question [Inaudible] please.
Unknown Speaker
Ms.
[Inaudible] can you hear -- can you hear me?
Yes.
Excuse me.
My name's [Inaudible] from [Inaudible] newspaper.
Now, looking at the current situation, you said that you would replace the models to be sold.
But in what regions? What kind of models did you replace? Can you elaborate on that? And the second, well, you mentioned that -- about the operating margin of automobiles, but -- the unit volume, etc.
But the motorcycles were not that much impacted.
And that is the reason why the operating margin for our motorcycles is good.
Can I interpret it that way?
Well, in what regions, what kind of models have been replaced, etc., I cannot make any specific reference.
But in the first half of the first six months, two or three months, for Civic CR-V, we had a shortage of semiconductors.
And the second half, we think, in the United States, we have -- given the current production situation, will be difficult to catch up.
So, instead, the small models in Japan and Asia, we -- these are -- those for which we do not have a shortage of semiconductors, and therefore, we replace them with these models.
So, on a weekly and on a regional basis, we are doing such things so that we can deliver products to our customers as soon as possible.
So, such replacements are taking place.
About the automobile, the profit margin, well, yes, I mean, we -- because of the shortage of semiconductors, and we are not achieving the unit sales that we intended to, so we cannot achieve the margin that we wanted to.
Motorcycles, likewise, are impacted by semiconductors.
And depending on the country, the market, I believe our motorcycles -- which motorcycles sell are different, and therefore, we are able to cover with that difference.
Those of which have high margin, those countries that the unit volume has increased as -- and therefore, in Thailand and Vietnam, and that is the reason for the positive.
So, it's not the case of that we do not have any problem.
But fortunately, in those markets which -- where we have high margin, were the areas in which we saw growth in the unit sales.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, Mr.
[Inaudible] Next question [Inaudible] please.
Unknown Speaker
[Inaudible] Hello.
Thank you.
I have two questions.
The first question is confirmation.
In the PowerPoint, the factors behind the profit before tax, you had previous -- that is 6 billion yen of the retail price factor for the ups and downs.
You had the raw materials situation, plus you had managed repricing successfully to make this number.
Is that how it went? Please share with us your strategy as well.
And also, you talked about the pricing.
And also, in mini vehicles class, they're produced in Japan, consumed in Japan.
And in fact, their soaring prices directly impacting the mini vehicles.
And what is the impact on that because pricing is difficult on that? 
So, let me explain the first part.
For the first half, like this time, we say 36 billion-plus yen.
Despite raw material prices hike, we managed.
That was -- the question about throughout the year, annually speaking, for this fiscal year as compared to last one, raw material prices from the previous forecast because of the inflation situation, the distribution, labor cost, and supplier, of course, suffer the same issues. But their cost up -- pressure is 390 billion yen.
The cost -- the pressure upward, total up to not much.
And our approach is to try to provide -- have a pricing that reflects values.
And of course, throughout the year, inflation and supplier situations, specifically the price negotiation, and actually, those events are happening in the second half, rather.
So, when we do pricing, we actually take up in first half already, anticipating what's going to happen next.
But actually, that is a plus-positive impact on the first half.
But throughout the year, I don't think we can absorb all of those cost increase factors.
And then, we have differences of the impact in second half and first half, and that is how those ups and down factors are allocated over the period.
So, pricing in Japan, as [Inaudible] said, speaking of the domestic market, of course, we are looking at other competitors as well.
And those mini cars, mini vehicles, we have our -- the OEMs for supply that too.
And we, of course, watch out the prices of those products of other companies, and it is kind of difficult to reflect the raw material price hike situations to the price of the products directly.
We have to make a decision over the quantities product.
And when we have the new model, new specification, we may pass it on the price hike part for the price of the products, but we would try to do that as we go -- going forward.
And thank you very much.
Operator
The next question will be the last question.
Nikkei Business [Inaudible] please.
Unknown Speaker
[Inaudible] Can you hear? Yes, can you hear me? Thank you.
About motorcycle sales, well, it's a detailed question, but Indonesia, as compared to others, I think the growth is not that fast.
Is the reason -- what is the reason? You talked about EV motorcycles.
But in Asia, the competitors, do you see that there is pressure coming from your competitors to try to push EV motorcycles -- electrified motorcycles?
[Inaudible] thank you very much.
Indonesia is more than 100%, but the growth is slower than other regions.
Which -- where did this come from?
Can you elaborate on your question?
Excuse me.
In the second quarter, the Indonesian sales, it says 101.9%, and in the fourth quarter, it's 90%, I think.
So, that ratio I'm talking about.
I'm sorry, I'll look it up.
Well, yeah, because in Indonesia, there is an impact of the recession, the slowdown of the economy, especially last year.
When it comes to Thailand and Vietnam, there was a lockdown in Asia, as you recall, and because of that impact.
At that point in time, Vietnam and Thailand grew.
So, this is in comparison.
I hope that you understand that to be the case.
And about the electrification of motorcycles in Asia, well, in India, there is this new manufacturer which has started up.
And they have a very forward-looking plan -- sales plan, and it seems to be working.
In Indonesia, again, competitors are putting pressure on us in terms of electrified motorcycles.
But we also, as I explained the other day, and heading toward 2030 and '35, we want to aim for a large unit sales in Asia when it comes to EV motorcycles.
It is true that competitors are putting pressure on us because of their growth.
But mobile battery pack -- we are using battery.
And the rickshaw in India, it's still battery, and they're doing demonstration tests there.
So, I think in Asia, mainly in the motorcycle -- motorcycle sector, we will try to electrify, put together a strategy in this market going forward.
Thank you. 
Thank you very much [Inaudible] So, this concludes our presentation session today.
Our financial results presentation, of course, those materials and the presentation package, available on our website.
And thank you very much, indeed, for your participation.

Operating executive and head of accounting finance supervising unit, Eiji Fujimura.
"
3542,HMC,2023,2,kohei-takeuchi,"director,-executive-vice-president,-and-representative-executive-officer",False,1,"First of all, I'd like to thank all of you for your support toward Honda products and activities.
I'd like to thank our customers and all stakeholders.
Thank you.
We apologize that the delay in vehicle production is causing inconvenience to our customers who are awaiting Hondas products.
We are working hard to deliver our products as soon as possible.
We hope to gain your understanding.
I'll then explain the financial results for the second quarter of FY '23 and give a summary of the focus for the fiscal year.
First, FY '23 results.
In this difficult business environment, including the semiconductor shortage, driving down automotive production and unit sales combined with soaring raw material prices, Honda has been making companywide efforts to improve profitability.
In addition, the increase in motorcycle unit sales and the impact of yen depreciation as sales revenue and operating profit for the first six months have increased year on year.
In the second quarter, specific semiconductor shortage affected production of main models mainly in North America.
But we made worldwide production allocations, utilized substitute parts, and replaced models sold, resulting in a year-on-year increase in group unit sales of automobiles.
In addition, sales revenue, operating profit, and profit for the period of all -- and all increased year on year due to price increases, commitments commensurate with improved product value, and strong motorcycle business, and impact of the yen's depreciation.
In the FY '23 forecast, group unit sales of automobiles is lowered by 100,000 units to 4.1 million units, taking into account the impact of semiconductor supply shortages.
In addition to the decline in unit sales, we expect to see continued inflationary pressure on costs.
However, we have revised upward a previous forecast for sales revenue, operating profit, and profit for the period, reflecting profitability improvement efforts, motorcycle unit sales increase, and recent weak yen.
Despite the challenging business environment, Honda will continue to accelerate initiatives for electrification and new growth in preparation for the future.
Next, the status of our automobile business in major markets.
First-half sales decreased from the same period year on year due to semiconductor supply shortages and others despite the positive effect of new model launches.
In the second quarter, sales in Japan and China increased year on year.
But in the US, shortage of certain semiconductors drove down production of mainstay models and inventories at dealers.
Although demand is expected to be firm, we have revised downward our previous forecast for FY '23.
In the second quarter, Honda announces initiatives for electrification.
In the U.S., Honda has agreed with LG Energy Solution to establish a joint venture to produce EV batteries and to manufacture them in the state of Ohio.
Honda has also decided to develop the three existing plants in Ohio as home to EV production in North America.
In China, Honda has established a new JV with Dongfeng Motor Group and also Guangzhou Automobile Group to procure EV batteries.
In addition, we signed an MOU with CATL to further strengthen a partnership aiming to establish a long-term stable procurement system in China and further its competitiveness that will continue to accelerate its efforts toward electrification.
Next to the motorcycle business status.
Although there were some effects of semiconductor supply shortages, sales in many countries were higher than in the same period of the previous year due to replacement of models sold and the use of subsidized parts, etc.
In Vietnam, we recorded record-high sales for the month of September.
Although sales in Pakistan affected by flooding, as well as China and other countries dropped, sales in India, Vietnam, and other countries were strong, leading to an upward revision of the previous forecast for consolidated FY '23 unit sales.
In September, Honda announced its launch -- it will launch more than 10 electric motorcycle models globally by 2025 and 3.5 million units by 2030 to achieve carbon neutrality.
Here is an overview of the first half of FY '23.
Despite a decrease in automobile production and unit sales due to semiconductor shortages and rising raw material prices, operating profit increased 11.2 billion yen, reaching 453.4 billion yen, due to price increases commensurate with enhanced product value and reduced incentives, as well as increased motorcycle unit sales and currency impact.
Earnings per share attributable to owners of the parent was 338.5 billion yen may be attributable to share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method of Japanese affiliates.
The table shows unit sales and profit and loss.
Next, consolidated FY '23 forecast.
Although we expect to see continued pressure on costs in addition to the impact of lower automobile unit sales, we revise upward the forecast on operating income by 40 billion yen to 870 billion yen, reflecting further efforts to improve profitability, including higher motorcycle unit sales in India, Vietnam, as well as other countries, us, and currency impact.
Earnings per share attributable to owners of the parent is revised upward by 15 billion yen to 725 billion yen.
Exchange rate assumptions are 135 yen to the dollar for the second half, 135 yen to the dollar for the full year.
Unit sales and profit loss are shown in the table.
As for dividends, interim dividend is 60 yen per share.
The annual dividend forecast remains unchanged and is 120 yen per share.
Honda will continue to strive for stable and sustainable dividend payments, aiming for a consolidated dividend amount payout ratio of 30%.
Regarding a share buyback announced on August 10, as of October 31st, the total number of shares repurchased was 15.33 million shares at a total cost of 53 billion yen.
Fujimura, operating executive and head of accounting finance supervising unit, will give the details.

Can you hear me? About India production, let me confirm the situation including the outlook.
Currently, the four motorcycle factories are closed down until tomorrow and also the automobile factories have also been suspended.
And with the spread of the pandemic, how are you going to try to secure the production of motorcycles automobiles -- automobile production in India? And how do you see the impact on the unit that can be produced? Well, it's very difficult to predict, but what is your premise on doing the production in India?

One, if you could give us a number in terms of lost production from last year as a result of the semiconductor shortage and if you could try to give us a number for how much production do you think will be lost in this current fiscal year as a result of the shortage? And secondly, if you can give us a high level of idea of where you think your alliance with General Motors is headed.
You seem to be cooperating on more and more areas and how close should we expect GM and Honda to become in the future?

3550,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,0,"Let me explain FY 2021 financial results.
First, regarding growth for 2021, unit sales of Honda Group.
For motorcycle businesses, 15.132 million units, automobile businesses are 4.546 million units, and life creation businesses was 5.623 million units.
I'll explain our main market situations next.
Total market in Japan dropped from last year due to COVID-19 pandemic impact.
N-BOX and others marked a strong sales results, however, Honda's sales declined year on year.
N-BOX series won the top unit sales out of the new launches in mini-vehicle segment for six years in a row.
In March, we launched new Legend in Japan equipped with Honda SENSING Elite, which is the world's first automated driving technology Level 3.
Total market in FY 2022 still remains uncertain going forward due to the concern of resurging COVID-19.
However, Honda expects the results will exit the year before thanks to the effective launch of a new model, Vezel.
Total market in the U.S.
declined year on year.
Nevertheless, as the gradual reopening of economic activities since May, the market slowly recovered though it ended up still below the last year.
Honda recovered the businesses mainly with the CR-V and Pilot finally being close to the market results.
During the fourth quarter, many of light truck models have upgraded those sales records of the month of March, outperforming the market growth.
Total market in FY 2022 is expected to be better year on year thanks to increasing vaccinations for COVID-19 and efficient economic policies.
Honda will enjoy the effective launch of our new model, Civic, as well as the sales expansions mainly with our light trucks so that our results will exceed the level last year.
The total market in China exceeded the level of our last year with effective stimulative measures for consumptions by the government.
Honda enjoyed a strong sales of Breeze, CR-V, Vezel, and so on.
And thanks to the extended EV lineups across leading models, we have a monthly record highest-sales units so far.
Regarding the total market calendar of our -- market of the calendar year 2021, we're expecting the growth from the year before along with the economic recovery, Honda will launch new models and will further improve EV lineups, aiming for this highest-sales results than the preceding year.
In April, in Shanghai Motor Show, Honda made a world premiere showing of SUV e:prototype or the first Honda-brand EV in China.
Moving onto the motorcycle business.
The markets have recovered in China, U.S., and so on.
Its largest market of Asia is showing much greater recovery.
However, it resulted to below the level last year.
Honda's results declined year on year.
In India since third quarter, the sales recovered to the levels same period last year.
In Indonesia, the sales of the fourth quarter have recovered to 83% of the same time last year.
China and Pakistan exceeded their level last year.
Total market of FY 2022 is expected to grow from the year before despite the concern of the COVID-19 flare-up.
Honda expects the sales to exceed year on year mainly in Indonesia.
Let's conclude our financial performance of the FY 2021.
Despite a decline in great demands due to COVID-19 impact, we have revisited our business activities to control SG&As and to reduce costs.
And with the positive effect of our credit loss provisions in this term for the financial businesses, the operating profit was 660.2 billion yen, outperforming the year before.
Profit attributable to the owners of the parent was 657.4 billion yen, also favored by the increased investment of profit based on equity method.
This slide also presents unit sales and P&L.
And next, with regard to the -- our FY 2022 forecast.
We plan to increase unit sales year on year across all business areas of Honda Group.
Regarding operating profit, albeit the impact by soaring raw material prices and concerns over supply shortages of semiconductors, as well as the effect of our credit loss provisions, we will press forward the actions to increase unit sales to optimize our production capabilities, to improve efficiencies of our product manufacturing, and to fortify the existing businesses, expecting to achieve 660 billion yen same as this year.
Regarding the impact of the semiconductor supply shortages, as of now, we are withholding production at some facilities.
Supply situations of those parts are changing day by day.
However, Honda managed to coordinate the production activities globally, so that we can minimize its impact on production throughout the year.
And for the expected business performance, we plan to defend 660 billion yen operating profit by catching up with the production together with our corporate efforts, and etc.
Speaking of dividends, annual dividends for 2021 is 110 yen per share with 28 yen more added to the previous expectation we announced, and the dividends for the fourth quarter is 54 yen per share.
Expected annual dividend for FY 2022 will be 110 yen per share, same as for FY 2021.
Our dividend policy is to keep the consolidated payout ratio aiming 30% despite our changing business environment going forward.
We decided to revise them as shown here making efforts to provide stable and continuing profit returns to shareholders.
Now, I'd like to hand it over to Mr.
Takeuchi.
"
3551,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,1,"Thank you for your question.
So let's talk about the operating profit margin for the automobile businesses.
For long, we have been trying to solidify the existing businesses.
We have actions over that.
And last year, of course, all Honda, we have been pushing forward reviewing off-the-air businesses.
And because of that, we are improving our business structures today.
And therefore automobile businesses, we have communicated that before, due to the development -- organization changes at a number of the models and a number of the derivatives are changing.
And also, we have introduced the Honda architecture for better efficiency.
By 2025, the number of the processes for the development will be down by 30%.
That's the actions we are taking now.
And in terms of the production, we are trying to optimize them, too.
And by the end of this fiscal term, we are going to close down the factories in the UK, and the Turkey, and Sayama factories will move to [Inaudible].
Thanks to that, we can improve our business efficiency for better operating profit margin.
And in terms of the second question, the development expenses for the electrification of the vehicles.
President Mibe, the other day, talked about 5 trillion yen R&D investments in the next five years.
And in the area of the R&D, we will of course define the core technology areas, where we are going to be pursuing our independent efforts.
And we also try to make a more improved efficiency for the current development processes for the models, so that way we can get more investment margins.
And then if we find some areas, which is efficiently pursued by the alliance, of course, the alliance with other companies would be a choice.
And in order to make that possible, we need to optimize the production system and make improvements for the efficient production.
This way, we can improve the efficiency of all, including the development.
And in terms of the investments, battery procurement is one of the issues that we believe to be a major one, and GM in the North America, the CATL in China.
Those are the areas that we are investing with already.
And for other kind of technologies, we were looking to the technology trends and particularities of the regions and so on, so that we can pursue the appropriate alliances.
And I cannot share with you how much we are going to need for the electrification processes, however 6 trillion or 10 trillion yen in five years.
Those will be the basic idea as we shared before.
Thank you very much.
Noriko Okamoto
Thank you very much.
Our next question from Yomiuri Shimbun, Katagini Sung, please.
Unknown speaker
Can you hear me?
Noriko Okamoto
Yes, we can hear you.
Please.
Unknown speaker
Thank you very much.
Katagini from Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.
Thank you for this opportunity.
I have several questions.
First, so you say that there is increasing profit, and you attribute this to the cost reduction of sales among others, SG&A and others.
Can you be more specific as to where the profit is coming? And also, you are expecting a further cost reduction for the next fiscal year.
Can you be more specific about next fiscal year where you say that you're expecting 200 billion or more cost reduction? And also about R&D expenditure.
And then compared to recently, it's 140.
So, it's higher than the past, 840 billion.
And also for safety purposes, electrification and safety.
Can you be more specific as to what you'll be doing, please?
"
3552,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,2,"Mr.
Takeuchi will answer these questions.
Thank you. 
"
3553,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,3,"So I can talk about unit sales and you can talk about the profits. 
"
3554,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,4,"So basically, we'll avoid the automobiles are 5 million units.
We have factored in the impact of the rise in raw material cost and semiconductor shortage.
Let me explain about semiconductors more in detail.
From the end of last year, due to COVID-19, we have been suspending our production, had problems with logistics, and the industry on the whole, had a shortage of components procurement, especially for semiconductors because there was a growing demand for games and there was a shortage in supply of semiconductors.
We -- for a stable supply, we, including overseas with multiple sources, have tried to secure our sources semiconductors so as to have appropriate inventory.
And for each of the companies, we tried to secure optimum inventory.
Initially, the semiconductor manufacturers tried to increase production and we tried to accommodate.
And so -- and we thought that there would not be a major impact.
But then -- and Texas was hit by a storm.
And then the semiconductor -- when semiconductor was hit by a fire outbreak and unfortunately in the first half of this fiscal year we were still continue to see an impact of semiconductor shortage.
But we will try to minimize the impact.
We're continuing to make effort to assist them.
And currently, we don't know what the situation will be, it's fluid.
But in the second half, we think we can recover.
And therefore, we can minimize the impact throughout the -- at the end of the year.
And even if there is an impact with -- through our corporate effort, as explained, we will be able to defend the budget that we explained.
And it is based on that premise so that we have put together this budget for FY '22.
Thank you.
Noriko Okamoto
Thank you.
Next question, Toyo Keizai.
Mr.
Yokoyama, please.
Unknown speaker
Yokoyama from Toyo Keizai.
Hello.
Question one, about North America.
So according to the survey, I have the number of days in stocks kind of pressured at the moment, very tight and is that because of the semiconductor situation or is that because of the market going so well and you're selling so well and these stocks are really tight? Is that the situation? So please let me understand how you take this now.
And in terms of the battery procurement, you have your alliance partner in North America and China and including Japan, you probably have a plan or idea about different markets in different regions including Japan, for instance? Please tell me your ideas about it in terms of the inventory situations in North America.
"
3555,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,5,"In the first place, since last year, due to the COVID-19, every company we needed to do the adjustment of the production days and because of that, of course, we have the effect by that all of the inventory level today.
And of course, every company has different origins from that and a semiconductor insufficiency, of course, caused that as well.
And we had some stocks of our semiconductors, thankfully, and we didn't have the immediate impact by that.
However, going forward, if the semiconductor shortage continues on and on then the tight in our stock situation may continue too.
And 33 days, that is the average stock days.
That is the average in North America.
Ours is about 50 days.
And semiconductors' situation is now being adjusted in the market and then we will look at the inventory levels and does supplies as well to try to alleviate the situation.
But in the second half, we will try to recover then so this way we can achieve 5 million yen target, finally.
And in terms of the battery, we are sourcing GM in North America and CTL in China, those other partners to try to get the batteries and, of course, batteries are one of those components and we need to work all night to see all those meetings that we might have different sourcing in different regions that we have not defined who as a yet.
But of course, we do have such ideas, as you said.
Unknown speaker
Thank you very much. 
Noriko Okamoto
Next question from Reuters.
Mr.
Shiraki? Mr.
Shiraki, excuse me.  
"
3556,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,6,"Well, about the situation in India.
Well, motorcycle plants -- due to the second wave of COVID-19 and also the lockdown that was introduced domestically, our dealers are also -- about 80% of our dealers in India closed down.
And from May 1st, four factories have been closed and will suspend production until May 18th.
That is our current situation.
Well, to be candid with you, we really don't know what will happen and we cannot predict.
But we have to observe what happens to the pandemic.
Do we have to ensure the safety of our associates? And with that in mind, we need to consider when to resume production.
About the impact on production units, we really did not know for sure as it at this point in time but for India, actually, last year, there was a big impact by the second half.
We saw the recovery was even better than we expected.
Thanks partially to the government's pump-priming measures.
But from the end of March and the second wave hit and currently the medical system has been totally overwhelmed and therefore we have to keep an eye on what is happening in India and carefully consider what needs to be done.
That is all.
Thank you. 
"
3557,HMC,2021,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer,False,7,"So in terms of how the semiconductor effect, we had 100,000 units affected last year.
And in the current year, as I said before, the effect continues in the first half, and in the second half, we are going to catch up.
And as of now, I expect that all those loss effects on the production will be a trade-off or set off at the end of the year.
And with GM, actually, two companies taking actions for the PFC and other areas of automated-driving support.
And we have announced collaborations in North America last year and we are continuing our discussions together and electrification strategy is supported by the GM alliance.
That is one of the pillars supporting that strategy and for that purpose, we are going to try to find out efficient collaboration going forward.
And in specific, I can not give you an idea as yet.
And going forward, when we are ready to share with you more specifics, we will, of course, do that.
Noriko Okamoto

3559,HMC,2021,4,kohei-takeuchi,"senior-managing-director,-head-finance-and-administration",False,0,"We will be giving you the details of the financial results and financial forecasts.
Allow me to begin my presentation.
First, the fourth-quarter results.
Honda Group unit sales.
Motorcycles, despite the drop in Indonesia and others, unit sales was up in markets such as India, Pakistan, and China.
Automobiles, despite decline in markets such as U.S., there was increase in markets like China.
Life creations saw increase in such markets like China, but decrease in the United States.
And next, income statements.
Sales revenue was up in all business categories reaching 3,623,800 yen, up 4.8% from the same period last year.
Operating profit, due to drop in SG&A and increase in profit attributable to increase in revenue model mix, operating profit was 213.2 billion yen.
Share profit of investments accounted for using the equity method was 68.1 billion yen due to profit increase derived from income in -- and the -- from increase in sales revenue model mix in China.
And moving on to change in profit before income taxes.
FY '21 fourth-quarter profit before income tax was 255.3 billion yen, up 251.5 billion yen from the same quarter last year.
Operating profit, due to lower SG&A expenses, profit increase coming from difference in the provision for credit losses, and change in revenue model mix, among others.
Operating profit was 213.2 billion yen, up 218.8 billion from the same period last year.
And please look at Page 14.
Sales revenue operating profit by business segment.
Motorcycle business operating profit due to profit increase from increase in unit sales and model mix combined with cost reduction effect, it was 72.2 billion yen.
Next, automobile sales-related operating profit, including automobile and financial services business, was 140.4 billion yen combined.
Automobile business operating profit due to profit in SG&A and -- as well as profit increase from unit sales, model mix change reached 37.6 billion yen.
Financial services business operating profit mainly due to difference in the provision for credit losses was 106.3 billion yen.
And next, life creation and other businesses recorded operating loss of 3 billion yen, which aircraft and aircraft engine operating loss was 7.8 billion yen.
And next FY '21 12 months financial results are as shown.
And please look at Page 16, change in profit before income taxes.
The profit before income taxes was 914 billion yen, up 124.1 billion yen year on year.
Operating profit, though there was decline in profit due to drop in revenue model mix, thanks to a cut in SG&A difference in the provision for credit losses, cost reduction effect among others, operating profit reached 660.2 billion yen, up 26.5 billion yen year on year.
And next, cash flows of nonfinancial services businesses.
Free cash flow was 303.8 billion yen.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of period was 2,528.3 billion yen.
Also, net cash was 2,048.3 billion yen.
Next, FY '22 consolidated forecast.
The beginning of Honda Group unit sales.
Motorcycles due to increase in Asia, our major market, we are forecasting 18 million units, up 2.86 million from last fiscal year.  Automobiles, though there is concern over semiconductor supply shortage due to market recovery and introduction of new models, we are forecasting 5 million units, up 450,000.
Life creation business, we are forecasting 5.9 million units, 270,000 units mainly coming from North America.
FY '22 consolidated financial forecasts are shown on this slide.
FY '22 forecast change in profit before income tax.
Despite a decrease factors such as increase in SG&A, including a difference in the provision for credit losses and lesser cost reduction effect due to increase in profit coming from revenue model exchange, we are forecasting the operating profit to be the same as FY '21, 660 billion yen.
Cost reduction effect is minus 51 billion yen.
But this is mainly due to sharp rise in raw material cost.
Meanwhile, we are planning for cost reduction of more than 200 billion yen and price increase.
Lastly, FY '22 capital expenditures, depreciation, and R&D forecast are as shown on this slide.
And this concludes my presentation.

Unknown speaker
Abe from Nikkei.
Nice to meet you.
First of all, the operating profit margin for the automobile business is recently -- the profit margin has been coming down, and it is 1% down to -- in March 2021.
In order to improve the operating profit margin of the automobile business.
What do you see a major action for that? And the other question is the purpose -- the target of electrification by 2040 zero-emissions vehicles will become 100%.
And EV SUV, those zero-emission vehicles.
And when you switch over to those types of the vehicles, how much investment would you do need? In case of a Tesla, they say in order to start up the one EV factory, they take about 100 million yen or so.
What is your prospect for the investment in your case at Honda?
"
3560,HMC,2021,4,kohei-takeuchi,"senior-managing-director,-head-finance-and-administration",False,1,"About the SG&A and what -- cost reduction we have achieved and we'll be achieving.
Well, as last fiscal year, the SG&A was in area where we have the financial business, and, well, compared to the previous year and when the U.S.
unemployments rate, compared to that, the provision wa -- back then was increased, therefore the credit losses.
But last fiscal year -- and thanks to the U.S.
government's support, as well as the fact that the unemployment rate improved.
We were able to reduce the provision.
And also aside from that, our business activities had to be held down due to COVID-19.
And with -- given the pandemic in the different countries, our workers, associates worked hard to reduce the cost.
And thanks to that.
And last, we saw the SG&A reduced year on year for FY '21.
And about the provision for credit losses, aside from that, even if we were to exclude that, we believe that we were able to achieve SG&A reduction of 200 billion.
And about cost reduction and also the effect of price increase, we're looking at both these.
And the automobiles, motorcycles, and life creation products, we want to focus on to make -- making our manufacturing efficient.
And together with our suppliers, we work hard where we can reduce the cost.
And I think that these efforts, as well as the price increase, have produced this result.
About R&D, we are expecting JPY 840 billion.
And as for R&D expenditure, well, it was 780 billion the year before, and therefore, 840 billion as high.
And before that, it was 820 billion.
So it is the highest on record.
That is true.
But this is because the existing -- the internal combustion engine is going to be electrified.
We need money, and we're shifting toward electrification.
I cannot give the breakdown of how much it will be spent on what, but it is res -- as a result of this shift.
And also connect, we are investing or spending another 40 billion for R&D.
But as Kuraishi said, it's not going to be purely used for R&D for Honda alone.
But we also want to rely on alliances.
And that is the reason why we are planning for 840 billion R&D expenditure for FY '22.
Thank you. 
Noriko Okamoto
Thank you.
Our next question, please.
From Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Mr.
Kamiyama, please.
Kamiyama from Asahi newspaper, can you hear me? Yes? I have two questions.
For the FY '21, I have a question about that.
In terms of the sales unit, you're expecting to grow them in the U.S.
and China in March 2022 period, FY '20 -- next year.
And I think that is maybe because of rebounding around from last year and for China.
Well, how much growth or percentage growth are you expecting in China? And question two.
So March 2022 sales is expecting to grow, but the appropriate level is down, including the net profit, and of course, that includes the soaring raw material prices and the semiconductor effect.
And how much of an effect included in those results?
"
3561,HMC,2021,4,kohei-takeuchi,"senior-managing-director,-head-finance-and-administration",False,2,"So JPY 15 trillion expectations for next year and JPY660 billion operating profit expectations next year.
So let me explain about it.
As I said earlier, cost reduction every year, negative JPY51 billion.
That is a difference as we said earlier.
More than JPY300 billion can't be reduced by the cost reduction efforts, as well as the price increases.
And then, with that all included, actually, you can find out the effects by the raw material price increases as much as the gap between the two.
And in terms of the semiconductor effect, as of now in the first quarter, as of now, today, we are changing our number of days in our operations and we are trying to reduce the type -- the mo -- type of the models we are producing.
This way we can try to contain its effect in terms of needed sales.
And of course, as much as we -- we are trying as much as we can do, but we can also cover that by diverse as well, but also JPY660 billion, as I said earlier, financial credit loss provisions.
So it was booked up in previous years, and then it was written off.
And then that is causing an effect.
And unemployment rates involved in this factor and also the subsidies by the government's going to be provided until the autumn and sometime like that.
And for those once -- JPY110 billion is going to be included for the negative effect.
And then it is not just the raw material prices, but JPY660 billion is a result could be based on the combination of all those efforts.
Seiji Kuraishi
And in terms of the net sales, the COVID-19 impact is getting alleviated globally today, and demand is coming down, thanks to that today.
And in the United States in April, the vaccinations going on smoothly, and Biden administration providing through the economy measures closing higher demands and we have 101 -- 111% of the market growth today year on year in the end of the -- in April.
And of course, semiconductor effect still continues in the States too.
And perhaps the growth rate is still uncertain because of that.
And in China, COVID-19 actually was just studied in China.
However, they have no impact whatsoever nowadays.
And in April, they had a good business.
However, they also are hit by the semiconductor situations, and we do have the impact in our factories as well.
And depending on how it goes going forward, its effect on the business will change.
However, as of now, China's government says that the total market will be 2.1 million cars.
And this -- they expecting to have the growth by 8% -- 108% of the last year.
And we're trying to do our business to be in line with the market growth.
And of course, we have to pay attention to the semiconductor situation, as well as the COVID-19 in the global business situations.
Thank you. 
Noriko Okamoto
Thank you very much.
The next question.
NHK, Taboi-san, please.
Thank you.
Can you hear me? 
Unknown speaker
Yes, please.
NHK, Taboi.
About the unit sales once again.
At [Inaudible] you say -- well, I'm sorry, it's 5 million.
And because of the soaring raw material cost and semiconductor shortage, what ex -- to what extent have you measured these impacts in coming up with this number? Can you give the breakdown of the impact of raw material and semiconductor shortage?

3563,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,0,"How do you do? I'm Kuraishi.
Matt Watanabe
Senior managing director and CFO, Kohei Takeuchi.
"
3564,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,1,"So let me explain our third-quarter FY 2021 financial results and full-year forecast of FY 2021.
Regarding the cumulative rated sales of Honda Group up to the third quarter, motorcycle businesses had 10.591 million units sold and automobile had 3.425 million units and life creation businesses had 3.855 million units sold.
With regard to the business situations in the main markets, unit sales that -- of total Japan market for the nine months cumulative dropped below the same time last year due to the impact of the COVID-19.
However, since October, the market improved from the year before when the sales had dropped post consumption tax hike.
the total market trend after October, marking the results better than the last year, thanks to the fine sales of N-BOX and effective launch of the new model N-ONE.
In FY 2021, N-BOX series have made the top unit sales in four year running of new launch unit sales ranking.
The total market in FY 2021 is expected to be below last year due to the impact of the COVID-19 and so on.
Honda expects its results to be below the year before because of the market deceleration impact and the short supply of semiconductors.
Regarding the total market in the U.S., due to the statewide resumption of the economic activities since May, the market is on recovery trend slowly.
However, the nine months cumulative results stayed below the same time last year.
Honda also is on recovery, mainly with CR-V, Civic and Pilot.
Nine months cumulative result was almost equivalent to that of the market.
Regarding the whole market in FY 2021, with high level of new infections of COVID-19 still continuing, expectations of the total market is not clear.
Honda will try to expand our sales, mainly with the light trucks, such as the launch of a new MDX model.
Nevertheless, due to the impact of the semiconductor short supplies and so on, our results will end below the level last year.
In China, thanks to the stimulative measures to boost consumptions, the unit sales in total markets marked higher than the same time last year.
Breeze, CR-V and Civic were selling well, plus the launch effect of new models, such as Civic hatchback, Fit and Life, Honda enjoyed growth better than that of the total market.
For six months running, we have achieved the record highest month sales.
In addition, we added EV lineups to the main automotive families.
In November, we launched M-NV, mass production EV model which was co-developed with Dongfeng Honda.
For the calendar year 2021, the total market will grow above the year before.
Despite the impact of the semiconductor supply shortage, Honda will try to perform better than the preceding year by incremental sales of the main models, further improvement of EV lineups and so on.
Next, motorcycle businesses.
In China and in the U.S., people tend to use motorcycles instead of the public transportation systems.
Because of that and the strong demand for the outdoor use, the market has almost restored.
This year, the largest market is showing gradual recovery.
However, the cumulative results in nine months still resulted below last year.
Honda also stays below the same time last year.
But in India and in Thailand, solid recovery is observed, so is the gradual recovery in Indonesia since October.
Expectations of the total market in FY 2021 is still under clear due to the impact of the COVID-19 and so on.
Honda is expecting sales drop in Brazil and elsewhere.
However reflecting incremental sales in India and Indonesia, we have revised our expectations for last time.
Next, let me explain the summary of the cumulative results inthree quarters of the year.
Despite increasing impact of the COVID-19 which cut down the demand, we continuously and radically reviewed our business activities across the whole group.
That resulted in the restrained SG&As and the reduced cost.
The operating profit was 447 billion yen, finally.
The profit up to the third quarter marked 444.1 billion yen, which was also contributed by the incremental shares of our investment profits in equity metrics.
Unit sales and the PLs are also shown in this slide.
Next, FY 2021 forecast, stating of the unit sales Honda Group.
Motorcycles sales will increase from the previous forecast due to the sales growth in India and Indonesia.
Automotive sales will drop from the previous forecast because of short supply of the semiconductors and so on.
In regard to the operating profit, despite the COVID-19 infections rising up again or impact of the semiconductors in short supply, we are up revising the forecast from last time with additional 100 billion yen to 520 billion yen.
In terms of the current profit, due to the incremental shares of investment profit based on equity methods, we are adding 75 billion yen to the last forecast, up revising the figure to 465 billion yen which is higher than the year before.
You can find -- you can also find unit sales and the P&L on the slide.
Dividends next.
Regarding the expected dividends for FY 2021, though the business environment is unclear, we can improve the revenues by revisiting our business activities.
We expect to provide 82 per share, 14 yen more to the previous announcement.
For the third quarter, we provide 26 yen, 7 yen more to the share.
Now Mr.
Takeuchi, senior managing director and CFO, will talk about the details of our financial results and forecast.
"
3565,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,2,"Yes.
In regards to your first question, yes, it is factored in.
So about cash flow, please?
"
3566,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,3,"So the semiconductor businesses, that is the reduction applied in the fourth quarter, January to March.
And in terms of the units, production number, production volume is hit harder.
And the semiconductor affected related to the Fit and in Japan and the Civic for the U.S.
market.
And those are the well-selling popular models so well for Honda.
Those were hit hard by the semiconductor.
Therefore, we needed to swap around or adjust or coordinate the production plants to alleviate the situation, but it wasn't enough.
And other companies, I don't know, I can't really say about it.
However, for the semiconductor short supplies, this is how we -- how it goes.
And we of course tried hard.
However, we ended up having this 100,000 unit losses.
However, the situation changes every day, even now.
So we keep addressing the situation, so that we can minimize this impact on our businesses.
"
3567,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,4,"Thank you very much.
Well, in regards to your first question about this impact of 100,000 units and whether this will impact production, whether there will be a decline in production? And also, based on this shortage, does Honda plan to review its procurement strategy? These are the two questions.
Yes, about the impact on production, whether we plan to reduce production.
Well excluding the breakdown of 100,000 units, whether this will directly lead to a reduction in production, I really don't have the information at hand.
So I cannot respond to that question.
And in regards to your other question about reviewing procurement strategy, well, currently, for stable procurement including overseas, we are sourcing procuring for multiple sources and trying to ensure as sufficient inventory.
So we're trying to do risk distribution and yet we are faced with the shortage.
So in regards to the semiconductor, Honda also will try to review what needs to be done including how to hold inventory.
So we are currently in the process of reviewing.
You might ask, we are relying on overseas and suppliers too much.
Well, in regards to procurement, we are doing based on QCD.
And so it's not intentionally that we are relying on overseas suppliers.
Matt Watanabe
Next question, Automotive News, Mr.
Hans Grimel.
Please ask your question.
Unknown speaker
May I ask in English, please? Thank you for taking my questions.
I have two questions.
One is about the earthquake anniversary.
It's the tenth anniversary of the earthquake, the Tohoku earthquake next month? What lessons did Honda learn about supply chain management from that disaster? And how are you applying those lessons in the current supply chain problems of COVID and semiconductors? And second question is, can you please give us an update on your cooperation and your agreement to align with General Motors in the United States and North America? When can we see some results from that? Thank you.
"
3568,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,5,"As I said, with regard to the supply chain, in the earthquakes in Tohoku, and we of course have experiences flat in Mexico.
Various disasters we have experienced.
And then in order to make the stable supplies including other countries, we always try to get supplies from several suppliers.
And of course, we need to consume some inventory levels for that purpose.
However, now, we have hit very hard by semiconductor shortage.
And we don't actually buy the semiconductors from the manufacturer of the semiconductors directly, but we have the secondary or tertiary manufacturers, we buy from two, and there are things we cannot control in this system.
And for the semiconductor businesses, we probably will have to address such as keeping certain level of inventories going forward to better manage that.
And in terms of GM and how -- the relationship with them, actually, we have already implemented our businesses together for the and maybe driving.
We have a broad range of the collaborations.
And last year, we have announced collaborations in North America.
The discussion is going on at the moment.
And for Honda, we need to have a powerful manufacturing -- powerful product.
We need to solidify and then make the to more powerful and solid.
And to do that, we are having a very aggressive discussion, so that we can strike up the win relationship with the GM finally.
And practically speaking, we do not have deadline for the discussions at the moment.
We simply have a broad range of the discussions, and I cannot really tell you when we do report the results back to you.
However, whenever that is ready, we will of course share with you the results with the -- of our collaboration.
Thank you very much.
Matt Watanabe
Thank you.
The next question, NHK, it's Mr.
Taboi.
Unknown speaker
Taboi from NHK.
Thank you.
A very detailed question, but on Page 13.
About the increase in the investment profit.
And also you talked about the increase in profit in China.
Can you explain about what are talking about when you say profit increase in China on Page 13? On Page 13, it talks about the current profit.
And here, we talk about the increase in profit in China.
So can you elaborate on this?
"
3569,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,6,"Your first question was about our EV strategy.
We've already launched the battery EVs in China, Europe, Japan.
So what is our reaction to the EV that's already in the market and also our future EV strategy and about Apple car production, has Honda been approached? Climate and sustainable development, sustainable society is a requirement.
And therefore, we cannot afford to lose any time when in comes to EVs.
Well, Honda, we mainly focus on HEV, and so we have been trying to introduce such EVs in 2030 globally.
We want to electrify two-thirds of the models that we'll be selling.
But meanwhile, to accelerate electrification into the different regions, we have to deliver Honda like products which carry identity.
And therefore, in North America, we collaborate with GM.
In China, we are -- have an alliance with CATL.
And also including our own EVs, where appropriate, we will choose the best approach there we believe is needed.
And so last year,radio said that Honda will enter climate neutral in 2050.
And we need to accelerate these efforts to achieve this goal.
And including our organization, we want to strengthen our R&D in energy-related topics, and we are concentrating our efforts and resources on.
About Apple Car, well, we have seen and heard about this both on TV and newspapers.
We don't know what kind of car it is to begin with.
And therefore, we cannot make any comment in regards to Apple Car production.
Unknown speaker
That is all.
Thank you.
Matt Watanabe
Due to the interest of time, next question is going to be the last one.
From [Inaudible] Mr.
Yokoyama, please.
Unknown speaker
Yokoyama from [Inaudible] Thank you.
Two questions.
As for the semiconductor supply shortage, including the supply chain perspective, what is the reasons for that program? And you said that that is going to be resolved, and it will not cause impact on the next fiscal year.
Is that right? And in the end of the year, the government talked about 100% EV cars by 2030 -- in 2050, that is something.
And then at the moment, you have N-BOX, but you have not much EVs available at the moment.
How do you approach for that?
"
3570,HMC,2021,3,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president,False,7,"So the -- speaking of the semiconductor shortage, what is the cause of that including the implication in the supply chain and impact on the next fiscal year, so both.
And then the -- in the Japanese market, the government is now saying the electric vehicles, 100% achieved by 2035.
And the idea of the mini cash and EV.
So semiconductor, as I said earlier, we do not buy semiconductors directly from the manufacturers of the semiconductor.
However, supplier told us that -- well, because of the COVID-19, the demand would come down, and that was the perspective.
Therefore, they reduced the production of the semiconductor at that time.
And then, in fact, people played games or used computers more because of the COVID-19.
Therefore, there was increasing demand for the semiconductors, not for the car but for others.
And that was why they had a higher demand.
And then at the moment, we are asking them to produce more, and suppliers are also planning to increase their production volume.
And I think the situation will resolve toward the next fiscal year.
And also the electrification of the Kei cars, I can't really share with you with the specific ideas at the moment.
However of course the direction of our company is to progress more electrification on and on.
And of course, Kei cars, one of those cars, we should work on.
And I'm not able to give you which model or which car is going to be the refined.
Of course, Kei cars will be of EV system going forward some time.
Unknown speaker
Thank you.
Matt Watanabe
Thank you very much.
We apologize, but we have ran out of time.
And therefore, for those questions we were unable to answer, the corporate communications will give you the answer later on.

Matt Watanabe
As a precautionary measure against COVID-19, this announcement is being made live stream without any audience in this room.
We see clear understanding.
First, executive vice president, Kuraishi, will be announcing our financial results.
"
3573,HMC,2021,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Allow me to give the explanation.
First, the third-quarter financial results, thethree months results.
Honda Group unit sales.
Motorcycle business increased in markets, such as Pakistan and India, while decreased in markets such as Indonesia and Vietnam.
automobile business increased in markets like China, U.S.
and Japan.
life creation business increased sales in OEM engines in mainly North America and Europe.
And next income statement.
Sales revenue, despite drop in motorcycle unit sales and negative foreign currency translation effects, increase in automobile and financial service businesses resulted in sales revenue of 3,771.5 billion yen.
Operating profit, despite increase in SG&A and currency translation effects, due to the efficiency improvement in R&D and cost reduction effects, among others, operating profit was 277.7 billion yen.
Due to reversal of impairment loss, profit increase in China, among others, share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method was 102.2 billion yen.
Next, I will explain change in profit before tax -- income taxes.
Third-quarter profit before income taxes was 386.4 billion yen, up 179.6 billion yen from the same period last year.
Operating profit was 277.7 billion yen, up 111 billion yen from the same period last year.
Operating profit excluding currency effects was 136.5 billion yen due to improved efficiency in R&D expenditure and cost reduction effects.
Regarding R&D expenditure, due to development, efficiency improvement and the fact that last fiscal year saw a significant increase in electrification costs, so it is lower, but R&D activities will be carried out as scheduled.
Next is by business segment information.
Motorcycle business segment operating profit was 72.7 billion yen despite cost reduction effects and lower SG&A.
These were partially offset by decreased profit attributable to decreased sales revenue and model mix.
Regarding automobile business segment and Financial Services business related to automobile sales, the combined operating profit is estimated to be 205.4 billion yen.
automobile operating profit -- though SG&A increased due to profit increase attributable to sales revenue and model mix as well as cost reduction effects, automobile operating profit was 123.1 billion yen.
Financial services operating profit was 85.7 billion yen due to accounting difference in the provision for credit loss, etc.
Regarding life creation and other businesses, there was operating loss of 3.8 billion yen.
Operating loss of aircraft and aircraft engines included in life creation and other businesses was 9.1 billion yen.
And next fiscal year '21, nine months financial results are shown.
Regarding changes in profit before income taxes, profit before tax was 658.7 billion yen, down 127.4 billion yen from the same period last year.
Operating profit despite reduction in SG&A and cost reduction effects, decline in sales revenue and product mix, among others, resulted in operating profit of 447 billion yen, down 192.2 billion yen from the same period last year.
Let me proceed to explain the nine-month cash flows of nonfinancial service businesses.
Free cash flow was 104 billion yen.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of third quarter was 2,521.2 billion yen.
Net cash was 1,884.8 billion yen.
And next is the FY '21 forecasted consolidated unit sales.
Honda Group unit sales of motorcycles due to upward revision of sales plan in markets, such as India and Indonesia, unit sales forecast is 15 billion units, up 200,000 units from the previous forecast.
Automobiles due to impact of semiconductor supply shortage, among others, unit sales forecast is 4.5 billion yen units, down 100,000 units.
life creation business remains unchanged at 5.5 million units.
Next, FY '21 consolidated financial forecast is as shown.
As for FY 2021, forecasted change in profit compared to last year, despite negative impacts, such as sales revenue, model mix and currency translation.
These will be partially offset by decreased SG&A and cost reduction effects.
We're planning operating profit of 520 billion yen.
Operating profit has been revised upward by 100 billion yen compared to the full-year forecast last despite declining in sales revenue and model mix due to cost reduction effects and cost in mainly SG&A.
Sales revenue and base mix include the profit decline attributable to semiconductor supply shortage.
Lastly, these are the FY '21 forecast, capital expenditures, depreciation and R&D.
This concludes my presentation.
I thank you for your attention.
Matt Watanabe
Thank you very much.
That was the results and presentation for the FY 2021 and third quarter of this year.
I now would like to entertain the questions from the media.
And in advance, we have already shared the way we proceed with this conference.
We're going to use Zoom system, and we are going to resume the Q&A session at 3:45.
Please wait for the moment.
Thank you.
Now, we'd like to start to Q&A session.
In advance, we have already introduced the media, journalist, we are going to accept questions through the Zoom systems.
[Operator instructions] Please start.
Raise your hand if you have questions, please.
Question from Mr.
Shimosato from Yomiuri Newspaper, please.
Unknown speaker
Shimosato from Yomiuri.
Can you hear me?
Matt Watanabe
Yes, I can hear you.
Unknown speaker
Question one, you revised the forecast.
And could you share with us the plus factors and minus factors for the revision factors? And then that you have reduced from 100,000 units because of the semiconductor shortage.
It is a big impact.
However, even after the recovery of the supply, you still have to reduce the number by 100,000, is that right? And also, up until when do you expect the impact of the semiconductor shortage to continue? Would that continue until the next fiscal year, again? And are there any impact on the operations of the factory? If you have additional impact on the factory operations, please let us know.
"
3574,HMC,2021,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Thank you.
So question one, with regards to the revision of the forecast, the plus or minus factors and then the 100,000 units down due to the semiconductor shortage and how long would that continue? Will the impact continue? So the revision of the forecast, we have the impact due to COVID-19 and also semiconductor supply shortage.
We do have the impact.
However, we have reduced cost, and we also revisited our business activities across the company.
SG&A, R&D cost expenses have been restricted, and then we're now are able to add 100 billion yen to make 150 billion yen finally -- for the profit finally.
Without the semiconductor shortage, without the exchange rate fluctuations, we will be able to absorb the impact by the coronavirus, COVID-19, and then we would have been able to report you the better results than last year.
However, the impact by the semiconductor will resolve in the first half this year, and it will resolve completely in the next fiscal year.
And we have adjusted our production models in different locations.
However, due to the shortage of the semiconductors, the forecast for the full year will -- the production have to be adjusted with a less of 100,000.
And then the impact on the values.
I'm afraid I cannot tell you.
However, we have already factored in the impact in the financial results this year.
And also, we're going to continue to address the situations to minimize the impact on our business.
Then semiconductor companies, suppliers trying to add the production to alleviate situation.
The situation is getting better.
Therefore, its impact will be resumed -- resolved in the first half this year.
And of course, we will adjust the calendar -- the production calendars and also the model mix in the production, therefore.
However, we can resolve the issues in the first half, not up to the FY -- next fiscal year.
Matt Watanabe
The next question from Nikki Shimbum.
Mr.
from Nikki.
Unknown speaker
Mr.
Asayama from Nikki.
Asayama from Nikki, can you hear me?
Yes, please.
You talked about the impact of the semiconductor short supply, and you said that you will not be able to quote any numbers as to the impact.
But you believe that you have factored in the impact into your sales and operating profit estimate and also about free cash flow.
Compared to the same period last year, you say that the -- well, I think that the cash flow is in the negative compared to last year.
So can you explain about the details? And how do you assess this? And this year, it is 104 billion yen.
First of all, question in regards to the impact of the semiconductor in terms of revenue as well as the operating profit is is factored in.
And next is about the free cash flow.
The positioning of the free cash flow and how it is assessed?
"
3575,HMC,2021,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,3,"This is Takeuchi.
I'd like to talk about the cash flow.
Well, until last fiscal year, we were seeing that the free cash flow had a positive impact.
But this fiscal year, in the first quarter, due to COVID-19, because of the unit sales decline, this has had an impact.
As for this fiscal year's forecast, well, we have made again another revision.
And looking at this, we think that the cash flow will be a positive.
And I said that the fourth quarter will see an impact of the semiconductor on the unit sales and sales, and this is also factored in.
But the decline from last year is due to COVID-19, and therefore, it is lower than the last year.
Matt Watanabe
Next question, please, from Asahi Newspaper, Mr.
Inagaki please.
Unknown speaker
Inagaki from Asahi, can you hear me?
Matt Watanabe
Yes, please.
Unknown speaker
So semiconductor business again, 100,000 units from January to March reduction of that much in the period.
Is that right? And also the forecast, would that impact on the production amount? For instance, how many units have to be reduced in the production because of that? And you said that you have less of 100,000 units.
And that is a greater impact than other companies.
How do you analyze the situations yourself? On Page 13, you have the reversal of the impairment of 56 billion yen reversal.
What does it mean? Could you elaborate on that, please, loss reversals.
So 100,000 due to semiconductor short supplies, and that is -- the question is if that is an impact on the first quarter and January to March? And the next question is, if the impact is greater in your company rather than others and also the reversion of losses -- reversal of the impairment losses, what is the impact of that? That's the question.
"
3576,HMC,2021,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,4,"And back to the reversal of impairment losses.
In equity methods, we have .
We havethree companies in the line, then we have Hitachi and .
We have a major companies .
And then we have pure appraisal of the assets.
And then we had their participation based on the equity method in the past.
And then of course every company has a different situations.
And then the share prices were down for some time.
And then we needed to pick up the lower share prices in the accounting practice because that is -- practice to take the lower prices for the impairment calculations.
And that is now taken up.
And then now we have TOB completed, and then we have -- we can now reverse the impaired amount in the past, and that was 106.8 billion yen much reversed back.
Matt Watanabe
Next question from Nikkan Jidosha.
Mr.
Jidorisan, please?
Unknown speaker
My name is Mr.
Dori, Nikkan Jidosha, Daily Automotive News.
Yes, well, I think you didn't answer the previous question.
But in regards to this downward revision of 100,000 units, does this lead to a reduction in production? And also the shortage of semiconductors based on this, are you planning to review or change your procurement strategy? This might be for the midterm, not just in the near term, but I think that what are the causes for this problem, is over dependence on mega suppliers? So can you explain about this as well?
"
3577,HMC,2021,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,5,"Well, in China, we have two production companies in China and these joint venture companies.
The profit, this is based on the equity method.
I talked about thethree companies in Japan.
But what I'm talking about is the two joint venture companies that we have in China.
And we have assessed this, and it is incorporated based on the equity method.
Thank you.
Next question, please.
Matt Watanabe
From GG Press, Mr.
Hirano, please.
Unknown speaker
GG Press, Hirano.
Thank you very much.
You talked about profit forecast that is higher.
You provided -- you said that cost reduction effect and the SG&A reduction are both reflecting on that.
And could you specify what sort of efforts in place for that? And to end, the reasons for the provision this time, the reduced SG&A and cost, what are the contents of those efforts?
"
3578,HMC,2021,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,6,"So 100 billion yen profit added, that's the provision.
And of course, had a -- said that negatively impacted by the semiconductor short supply included.
And in the third quarter, because of the COVID-19 of course there was some restraints on the activities of businesses.
Then in different regions, we've worked on the SG&A, and we had did all cost reductions and R&D being revisited to.
And then together with the performance in the third quarter and of course we need to continue those activities onto the fourth quarter too.
And that means that every day level, we need to revisit how we spend, and then the aggregation of those efforts are now reflected in this forecast.
And then of course there's no single thing that make a good contribution.
However, that is the cumulative efforts.
I think I should say motor show was not in place.
Those events were canceled.
So that was a good part of the reductions and also the new launch of models.
Now this made online instead of the real and the cumulative efforts like that is now realized.
Of course, we would like continue this sort of our effort going forward.
And of course, events will happen of course we will do that for the new launch and so on.
But how are we going to hold? How we're going to do those new launches then, will have to be thought out.
So we'll try to maintain those efforts going forward.
So the effect is going to be enjoyed going forward.
Next question.

Kuraishi, you talked about relationship with GM saying that there's nothing further that you can explain to us today.
But what sort of expected synergy for cost reductions further? Per annum, by how much further? Or given those on the cost benefits and they can be diverted into investments in other areas, what sort of synergy would you expect altogether? And also, North America, the market is very important for you.
And there, with the alliance with someone like GM, your power control or the authority, I wonder whether you would end up maybe conceding kind of your authority or the power to the Good morning.
Is that ever a concern that you have in the North American market?
Matt Watanabe
OK.
Again, thank you very much.
We received a question relating to the relationship with GM.
What will be the expectable synergy in the areas of cost reductions and how that can be used in other areas? And also, because you have the alliance agreement with GM in the North American market, is there any possible concern on the less power of influence or whatever that you may have?

This financial results announcements with the COVID impact, we have no audience on site, and this is going to be an online broadcast.
Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation.
So first of all, we like to have Mr.
Kuraishi, executive vice president, to explain the financial results for this term.
"
3584,HMC,2021,2,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,1,"Thank you.
Now I, Takeuchi, am going to explain starting with the FY '21 second-quarter financial results consolidated.
On the group unit sales of motorcycles, increased in Pakistan, Philippines, and Brazil but decreased in Indonesia and India.
Our unit sales of automobiles decreased in Japan and Indonesia, and at the same time, increase is recorded in China and the United States.
Income statement.
Sales revenue.
There was an increase in sales revenue in Financial Services business, on one hand.
Decrease, however, in automobile business and negative effects of FX translation.
So it resulted at JPY 3,651.3 billion operating profit.
Although there was a decrease in profit attributable to decreased sales revenue and model mix, operating profit stood at JPY 282.9 billion due mainly to a decrease in SG&A and cost reduction efforts.
Next, to explain change in profit before income taxes.
Profit before taxes for the second quarter FY '21, owing from to the reduction of SG&A and the efforts to cut down on costs, was JPY 345.7 billion, which is up by JPY 56 billion year on year.
Operating profit, JPY 282.9 billion, up by JPY 62.8 billion.
Performance by business segment.
Operating profit of Motorcycle business was JPY 68.4 billion, given decrease in cost down, the cost of benefits and SG&A expenses.
But due to the lower sales revenue and model mix changes, was JPY 68.4 billion.
Change in the overall situation was quite noticeable.
Next, turning to Financial Services, JPY 93.2 billion.
Life Creation business and others.
Sales fluctuation and channel mix exchanges, so the number that you see here.
For others, please note that for aircraft and aircraft engine losses, which are categorized in others and also in Life Creation business, was JPY 8.1 billion.
So summing up, the operating profit for automobiles and the automobile sales portion of the financial services was JPY 214.6 billion.
FY '21, six months profit and losses are shown here.
To explain profit before tax, was down by JPY 307.1 billion.
Operating profit, because of the cost reduction and SG&A expenses, which was offset by sales revenue decline, was JPY 169.2 billion, down by net JPY 303.3 million.
Turning to the quarter, six months total, JPY 57.9 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter was JPY 2,626.5 billion.
Net cash stood at JPY 1,843.9 billion.
Now, to explain about FY 2021 consolidated forecasts.
For the Honda Group's unit sales of motorcycles, the same as previously forecast at JPY 14.8 million.
Automobiles, upward revisions for China and Japan means they're further increased by 100,000 units at 4.6 million units.
Life Creation business, up by 190,000 units at 5.5 million units.
FY 2021 consolidated business forecast, as you see here.
Changes from the previous fiscal-year actuals.
Due to the decline in the unit sales, and also because of the sales mix change and FX negative impact, the year had positive benefits coming from the reduced SG&A and other costs.
So JPY 420 billion operating profit is planned.
And now, on a vis-à-vis the previous forecast made for the full year, increase in the unit sales and also the cost reductions such as for SG&A and others, JPY 220 billion upward revision on the full operating profit.
Finally, FY 2021 capex, depreciation, and amortization and R&D expenditure, as you see here, and that completes my explanations to you.
Thank you very much.
Matt Watanabe
Thank you.
And with that, we conclude the FY 2021 Q2 results presentation.
Now, from this point onward, we are going to receive questions from the members of the media.
As we announced to you previously, we are going to receive questions through the Zoom system.
We are going to resume at 15:40, 3:40 p.m.
Japan time.
Thank you.
So until then, please wait.
We are going to break for a moment.[Break]
Now, we are going to move on to questions and answers.
As we announced to you, prior to this, the meeting, we are going to receive questions through the zoom session.
If you have a question, please use the hand icon on the screen and in the interest of time and they may suggest to him that they will be or limit your questions into two questions per person.
If you have a question, please use the hand icon.
OK then.
We'd like to take questions from a reporter, Hanada from Nikkei Newspaper.
Mr.
Hanada, could you turn on your microphone to ask the question, please? Mr.
Hanada? OK.
Sorry, but because he is not responding, so we'd like to proceed to the next reporter.
OK.
Then we'd like to take the next question from Yomiuri newspaper.
Reporter Shimo Sato, please?
Unknown speaker
OK.
This is Shimo Sato from Yomiuri newspaper.
Can you hear us OK?
Matt Watanabe
Yes, I can.
We can hear you.
Unknown speaker
Refer to Pages 13 and 16 in the material.
For the second-quarter sales, among the factors that contribute to the sales, the impact from the COVID-19, how much of an impact was there from COVID-19? And also, if you're looking at the first half of the fiscal year, you have a negative of JPY 488.2 billion.
How much of that is due to COVID-19, would you say?
Matt Watanabe
Thank you very much for the question.
To answer the first question, this was for the first quarter, I believe.
The factors that contributed the fluctuations in sales, how much of an impact -- sorry, for the second quarter, how much of an impact from COVID-19? And the second question was for the first half of the fiscal year, this JPY 488 billion.
Of that total decline, how much of an impact from COVID-19?
"
3585,HMC,2021,2,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,2,"OK then.
Let me answer that one.
Well, are they looking at Page 13? I think you referring to the year-on-year results comparison.
If you look at the volume mix, it's about JPY 40 billion minus.
So this is coming from a motorcycle.
From a year-on-year comparison, this is consolidated number.
This was a 76,000 decline in automobile and then 240,000 decline in motorcycles.
But if you ask me if that's all coming from COVID-19, that's difficult to say.
So most, I believe, is due to the COVID-19.
But if you ask me, all the reduction in unit sales, are they coming from COVID? But if you look at the total, this is -- and all is this, the total, this is coming from JPY 40 billion decline due to this.
And if you look at the six-month results, the year-on-year comparison with last year, it's about JPY 500 billion decline.
If you look at the motorcycles, these 2.3 million units and 640,000 units decline in automobile, so those declines are included in here.
As I explained, the results are the same.
So of course, there was no COVID last fiscal year.
So was it all due to COVID-19? Of course, other factors are mixed in.
Does that answer your question?
Unknown speaker
Yes.
Matt Watanabe
Thank you very much.
So let us move on to the next question from Nikkei newspaper.
Mr.
Hanada, the floor is now yours.
Unknown speaker
Thank you very much.
And sorry for not being able to ask properly a few moments ago.
Please wait.
It seems that there's signal interference.
Changes in the business environment is my broad question.
Well, so far as the Automobile business is concerned, the expected ban on the sales of the gasoline on the running of the automobiles, and they're all in 2050, the target to get rid of the carbon-oriented activities in Japan.
So what do you think of those expectations at Honda? And also the U.S.
presidential election, how the environmental regulation or the production mix may change or not sell going forward as a result of the presidential election in the States?
Matt Watanabe
Thank you very much.
So two questions.
Number one, in Europe and the United States, are there prohibition to sell the more gas-running automobiles and Japan's announcement to get rid of from the carbon-oriented business activities in 2050.
And the second question has to do with the outcome of the U.S.
presidential election.
How, when one considers, that it might impact the future the environmental regulation or the protectionism? Thank you.
"
3586,HMC,2021,2,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,3,"For year on year, comparing the three months, we had about JPY 3 billion cost reduction, additional.
So this just goes back to precious metal and other raw materials.
It's actually going up.
This was like a JPY 10.6 billion, over JPY 10.0 billion.
So this is comparing a three-month and three-month.
So we are seeing the cumulative results from the cost reduction.
And then the selling price differences.
So we have about JPY 50 billion plus due to the selling price adjustment on the incentive.
And SG&A, of course, business trips are cut down.
One big factor is within the SG&A.
In North America, we have major finance operations to sell automobiles to make it easy for customers to buy automobiles.
So we have credit losses.
Depending on the defaulting, we have to book provisions for allowance for the credit defaulting.
But that's gotten better.
So this is our JPY 17 billion-plus.
So that way, we have been able to cut expenses.
So this led to a total of JPY 52 billion better results, actually, improvement.
Unknown speaker
OK.
Thank you very much.
Matt Watanabe
So moving on to the next person.
From NHK, Mr.
Suboi, please.
Unknown speaker
Yes.
Suboi from NHK, is it audible?
Matt Watanabe
Yes, we can hear.
Thank you.
Unknown speaker
Thank you.
Just listening to all the discussions and to presentations, once again, let me ask the following.
Second-quarter recovery, is that in line with your recovery like in China and the United States? And there was the recovery of sales.
Was that a part of your original expectation? And also, the full-year forecast on the upward revision, fine.
But in the United States and Europe, the number of positive cases is on rise once again.
I think you used the expression of being uncertain or opaque or whatnot.
So what's sort of different strategy that would you deploy after all?
Matt Watanabe
Thank you.
So the first question has to do with the second-quarter recovery, whether or not it was part of our expectations or exceeding our expectations.
So please let us respond to that first.

And then we have Mr.
Kohei Takeuchi, senior managing director.
"
3589,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,1,"The COVID-19 was spread around the world since the end of the fiscal year ending in March 2020.
It continues to raise around the globe even today, bringing serious damages to the economy.
However, in the second quarter of this fiscal year ending in '21, economic activities have been reopened in many markets with resulting gradual recovery in demand.
In some markets, the second wave of the pandemic has arrived, and the situation remains unpredictable.
But Honda will continue to be thorough in its actions to prevent infection and proceed to supply products to the market in a timely manner.
Now, I would like to present to you the outline of the financial results for the second quarter and the full-year forecast for the fiscal year ending in '21.
Starting with the unit sales of Honda Group cumulative to the second quarter of this fiscal year, it was 6,322,000 units for motorcycles, 2,045,000 for automobiles and 2,453,000 units for Life Creation business.
Next, I'd like to explain the situation in each of the main markets.
First, to look at the Japan market, the total market is showing a moderate recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 since May.
However, due to the last-minute demand before the consumption tax hike in the previous year, the total demand was considerably lower than compared with the same period last year.
Honda's unit sales undercut last year's number.
But looking at these unit sales by model, N-WGN and new Fit surpassed the sales in the same period last year, meaning a recovery in the second quarter.
N-BOX series set No.
1 in new car sales for the first half of the fiscal year ending in '21.
Our outlook for the total market demand for the fiscal year ending in '21 remains unchanged from the previous forecast.
And it is expected to be lower than previous year.
Due to the market slowdown, Honda expects to see lower sales compared to the previous year, but in view of the recent sales results, we have revised our forecast upward from the previous forecast.
In the U.S.
market, the total market demand has been gradually recovering since May due to the phased easing of regulations and economic activities and reopening of the dealer business, but demand was lower than the same period last year due to the decline in the fleet market.
Honda's unit sales were lower than the same period last year, but we are seeing recovery at a better than market pace, mainly with CR-V and Civic.
And Civic maintained the lead in this segment with its high product features.
Also, at the end of September, a new TLX was launched as well.
Total market demand for the full year ending in '21, beginning with the second half of September, our COVID-19 cases have been increasing again in number, mainly in the Midwest.
So the outlook remains uncertain.
The forecast is for lower demand compared to the previous year.
Honda expects to see lower year-on-year results in the face of this uncertainty of the market.
Next, looking at China, in addition to the resumption of economic activities, consumption stimulus measures were taken so the total market exceeded the same period last year.
Honda has favorable sales of models such as Breeze, Vezel and XR-V.
And also in the second quarter, we launched three models, namely Civic Hatchback, Fit, and Envix hybrid, which actually brought us better than market growth.
From July to September, single-month sales results marked record-high numbers consecutively for those three months.
For calendar year 2020, the total market demand exceeded that over last year from April to September.
But as the market took a huge decline due to COVID-19 in January to March, the impact of which could not be fully recovered.
So the total market is expected to be lower than last year.
Honda, with the launch of new models and running factories at full capacity to increase supply to the market, is aiming to exceed sales higher than previous year.
We have revised our forecast upward from the previous forecast on the basis of the recent sales situation.
Now, turning to motorcycles.
The impact of COVID-19 differs significantly from one region to another.
In China and in the U.S., due to the trend of using motorcycles instead of a public transport, added to the heightening outdoor leisure demand, the market has almost fully recovered.
On the other hand, in Asia, the largest market, in addition to the impact of COVID-19, due to the tightening of loan screening criteria in Indonesia, the market contracted in Asia year on year.
Honda, despite strong sales in China and the U.S.
and in India and Brazil, we restarted production in June, and it is steadily recovering sales.
But still, we saw its sales fall below the same period last year.
The total market demand for the fiscal year ending in '21, we expect that even though the recovery trend continues in many markets, Indonesia will still see continued decline in personal spending due to the tightening of loans.
Therefore, no prospect for rapid decline that the market will be lower than the previous year.
Honda expects lower sales in Indonesia and some other markets, but higher sales in markets, including India, Brazil and the U.S.
So on our forecast on a global basis is for sales equivalent to the previous forecast.
Now, moving on to the outline of the six-month results for the fiscal year ending in '21.
The first quarter brought us very, very challenging situation with the impact of COVID-19.
But with this environment of living with COVID, we have proceeded with solidifying our existing businesses further, and at the same time, we have made a fundamental review of our business activities across all areas to secure a strong resilient business constitution that support future growth.
As a result, our better control of SG&A expenses and cost reduction, those brought us a turnaround from the first quarter, bringing an operating profit of JPY 169.2 billion for the six months.
Profit for the period under review was due to the contribution from profit from investment based on the equity method, it was a JPY 160.0 billion.
The unit sales and income statement are as shown on the slide shown here.
Moving on to the forecast for the fiscal year ending '21.
For unit sales, we have increased our automobile forecast from the previous forecast, considering the favorable sales in China and other markets and also increased our Life Creation business forecast in view of the strong sales in North America.
For operating profit, incorporating the business constitution reinforced in the first half where our estimate is JPY 420.2 billion, an upward revision of JPY 220.0 billion from the previous forecast.
Though the future of the market remains uncertain due to the COVID-19, but with our initiatives to curve SG&A expenses and to reduce cost further, Honda will aim to enhance its business characteristics further.
Profit before taxes, due to the increased investment profit share due to the equity method, are expected to be JPY 660.0 billion.
Once again, the unit sales and income statement are as shown.
Next, about the dividend.
Forecast for the full-year dividend for the fiscal year ending in '21 is due to the operating profit and the increased investment profit based on equity method.
Compared to the previously published forecast, dividend bought per share has increased by JPY 24 to JPY 68 per share.
And for the end of second quarter, it will be JPY 19 per share.
Next, I'd like to hand over the microphone to Mr.
Takeuchi, senior managing director, chief financial officer, to present the details of the financial results and forecast.

3592,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,4,"Well, of late, yes, on top of the Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's declaration in the U.S., U.K.
or Europe, order flourished.
The conventional gasoline in the operated vehicles are likely to be shifted to the new types of fuel.
So the interest is becoming higher and higher toward the electrification of automobiles, among others.
At present, Honda's view is that we incent the reference to the HEV in the vehicles, electrification or that sort of move for the engine technology.
And so that our aim is to electrify two-thirds of our global automobile unit sales in 2030.
That's for Honda.
In all regions and different regulations or the penetration of those mandates and we will be witness, not to mention the appetite and changes from the all-from other customers in the regions.
So for each and every region, whatever would be the characteristic of Honda, that is going to be our point of emphasis.
That means the alliance with GM in the States, there was the agreement in China.
So these are the exemplary arrangements.
And of course, we regard that the inclusive of the electrification or the promotion of HEV vehicles, we would like to be the tech being considered.
Our President said, Mr.
Hachigo, that we are going to aim for the realization of carbon neutrality by 2050, so that means that we have to accelerate further.
We have moved toward the electrification of cars.
This was sophisticated energy power units.
And all the other elements that would need to be enabled will be the areas that we are going to prioritize our resource orientation.
To become carbon-neutral, everything would have to change.
So things that we need to do will be not only on the Honda alone, but also together with other members of the community, so energy-related research activities that we are engaged in rather actively at Honda so that in order to realize our goal of being carbon neutral, we would like to lead the community at large.
And as to the outcome of the presidential election in the United States, well, after all, the official result is not announced yet.
It's a little better that we hear the official announcement of the outcome of the presidential election.
Of course, the different relationship, the relations between the two countries is to be preserved and strengthened so that we can continue to provide our proud vehicles into the States.
So at the same time, we also hear the protectionism maybe tightened.
I really do hope that it's not going to hinder our business activities going forward.

That's right.
I mean, the profitability of automobile business.
In the reform of the automobile on the business, what is the progress to date of your working together with the GM? And also, maybe the resulting kind of reductions or the handling of results in the Life Creation business?
Matt Watanabe
OK.
So GM relationship and how do we stand and how we have been able to produce the outcome of that.
"
3593,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,5,"The profitability of automotive business has been foremostly in our mind.
Now, progress with General Motors.
As has been announced already, that's basically what I am able to say.
Only that because although we are in discussion with GM from various angles, there's nothing further that I can explain to you right now right here.
In any case, so that we can accelerate the electrification of automobiles, and it is my belief that this relationship within GM is quite conducive.
Or by joining hands with GM, what we have been doing over the years, which is that you make investments in the area of the gasoline, the running automobiles.
What further utilization of those technologies that we would like to consider further? And I believe that we will be able to do so, particularly now that we are working closely with GM.
And the order we have established there to reduce emissions, and that's something that we are upholding because we are together with GM in these activities, we should be able to do more.

But for the full year, how are you viewing this? And also, there were some restrictions on the economic activities and production stopped.
So how do you view that? And for the total market and then also your company's results.
That's my first question.
Matt Watanabe
Thank you very much.
I believe that your question is how do you view the recovery in total market demand in the States and the Chinese market for the second quarter.
And also, you want to hear the analysis of the total market and Honda's results if this is a reaction after the first quarter.
Thank you.
"
3594,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,6,"The first quarter was a very challenging situation for all of us, and then we are seeing a recovery in second quarter.
And then, of course, they could be.
There is uncertainty about the second wave about COVID-19 in the second half.
But we believe that we will have our 4.6 million units planned.
This is higher than our previous one.
So the unit sales is growing for focusing on China.
And then we will have only 4% decline in unit sales year on year.
To look at China first, well, this is where it all started, so it was that the impact was huge.
However, in the second quarter, now the full sales environment has recovered and also CR-V MMC, Fit FMC, so the product lineup has been strengthened, and then marketing activities have been reinforced.
So we are seeing a good visits to the dealers.
And also, we are seeing good sales.
And that's why it led to good overall sales results.
For the calendar year, because of those new models, new vehicle launches, we will see -- we hope to see year-on-year better sales results for China.
For North America, if you look at North America, well, actually, with the easing of the economy, the second quarter is seeing a recovering trend.
And then for the future, unless there is -- assuming that there will be no major changes coming, our forecast is that we will get about 80% compared to last year, so 14 million.
And then for the second half of September, we are seeing new cases of COVID.
So we still cannot really predict the future going forward.
However, we will closely be monitoring the situation and take speedy actions together with the dealers.
And Honda, the sales is recovering.
In September, we've taken some initiatives on incentives.
So we saw good, better results year on year, month on month.
But for the second quarter, third quarter, we hope to aim for the second half of the year, we hope to see better results compared to last year.
Thank you.
Matt Watanabe
[Foreign language] OK.
So if you have a second question, Mr.
Inagaki?
Unknown speaker
Sorry, additional question.
The recovery in the States, this is because the people were unable to make purchases because of the activities are restricted? And then those demand came back? That was the additional question.
And then if you look at the Page 13, if we look at Page 13, the cost reduction effect, you say.
And then the SG&A control, I believe we have good effects, but I'd like to hear more details about it.
If you did something like reduced like business trips or something like that, I'd like to hear the actual details about what you did.
"
3595,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,7,"Talking about the second quarter, the first one is, as you say, because of the lockdown, production was suspended, and so overall, the inventory level was just simply short, where we saw a shortage in inventory.
And then now in the second quarter, we started seeing sales growth.
That is one of the factors.
However, at the same time, on the other hand, we made some efforts, initiatives in our sales activities.
And then mentioning, so we've done some incentives.
They have, like, over $4,000 incentive, but we provided about $1,800 incentive.
So it has been lower.
So the selling expenses has been reduced.
And then that's because we were getting short on inventory.
So we did not have to spend that much on incentive.
That's one thing.
So I think I can hand over to Mr.
Takeuchi for cutting costs.
"
3596,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,8,"OK.
As of the first quarter, whether or not we were able to have the clear expectation or not.
Well, frankly speaking, the actuals exceeded our expectation.
China, that was the end of the first quarter, the three months period, it was getting better.
But in the United States, we really could not see through the situation at all.
So in that respect, I'd say that what actually happened in the second quarter for our actual results exceeded our expectation.
Now, the most recent rise in the number of positive in the patients of coronavirus, whether or not that is so much that is starting to affect our business operations negatively, not so, I'd say.
However, it is also true that some of the dealers are though temporarily shutting down their doors, so they are temporary, even the closure of dealer activities.
So that means that they want to work against our performance going forward.
So we have to see what happens.
Matt Watanabe
We also would like to respond to your second question.
So reporter Yokoyama from Toyo Kezai.
Unknown speaker
Can you hear me OK?
Matt Watanabe
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Unknown speaker
Thank you.
As announced already, the production results for September, you're seeing higher results compared to the last year.
Now that your production is coming back, and the demand is -- is demand recovering? And then the inventory situation in North America, are you still have a shortage in inventory, or do you have enough in inventory? That's all of the things I'd like to ask.
Matt Watanabe
OK.
Thank you.
For the September production results, so is your production ready? And then is the demand coming back? And then the second question was inventory situation in North America.
Thank you.
"
3597,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,9,"OK.
If you look at the September, most recently, for North America, we are back to 90% back to usual.
On the other hand, depending on the model, the inventory level is short on some models.
So we are making some additional production as well.
The inventory is like 52 days' worth of inventory.
And so currently, we are at the standard inventory level to which we are finally coming back to.
But depending on the level -- sorry, the model, it varies, but we are almost back to a standard inventory level.
Unknown speaker
OK.
Thank you.
Matt Watanabe
OK.
Thank you.
From Automotive News, Mr.
Okamura.
Are you there?
"
3598,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,10,"OK.
As to the cost reduction benefits expectable, what I said was that we signed on to the memorandum.
And then what we are doing right now is that we are engaged in discussions as to the content and the substance in the MoU memorandum.
So I really cannot say anything more definitive.
However, it is for sure that Honda is certainly in regards that there is going to be the understandable, acceptable benefits to accrue.
But that said, I cannot quote any number per se.
By the way, any concern about the power of control, the influence or whatnot, this is the business relationship with not a lot of capital injection.
It is not the capital participation.
Rather, it is really on the basis of the operations.
So we know that what we are not interested and engaged in the North America and America -- North American market, we will not do it after all.
So in that context, I would say that because we are working more and more in the direction of electrification of cars with the GM, maintain is the hybrid, the category of vehicles.
We have the meeting of minds.
So then, we regard that we can come out so good when the beneficiaries from these relationships.
Certainly, we have any concern whatsoever that we have to concede on the power of control.
Thank you.
Matt Watanabe
OK.
Going into the next question.
Next reporter, Mr.
Mizudori from Daily Automotive News.
Mrs.
Mizudori from Nikon Automotive newspaper, yes, we can hear you.
Thank you.
Unknown speaker
I have two questions.
First question is concerning the domestic market.
But earlier, you talked about the -- for Europe and the U.S., you said the growth was better than your estimation.
But I believe you have upped your estimate by 10,000 units.
So for the second quarter, was the domestic market better than expected? And then may I continue on to my second question?
Matt Watanabe
Yes.
Unknown speaker
So for the R&D cost, so you said you reduced the full-year estimate by JPY 40 billion or so for R&D cost.
Would that have an impact on product development that they may -- I believe Mr.
Hachigo mentioned are possibly launching a Level 3 by the end of the year? So if there's any impact, please let me know.
Thank you.
Matt Watanabe
Thank you very much for the question.
The first question was for Japan domestic market, so total demand and also Honda's situation.
That was the first question.
And the second question is about the R&D cost.
So for the full year, we reduced it by JPY 40 billion.
So would there be any impact from that? Thank you.
"
3599,HMC,2021,2,seiji-kuraishi,"executive-vice-president,-representative-director",False,11,"OK.
Speaking about the Japanese market, well, we are seeing a recovery from July to September.
And then the most recent minivan sales is recovering.
So compared to the 630,000 units, now we are upped it by 10,000 units to 640,000 units.
So of course, the market going forward is still uncertain.
However, we would like to keep a close watch on this.
And then for R&D cost, so because of the COVID situation, there is a bit of a delay in development of new models.
But on the full-year plan, we are still on plan.
This JPY 40 billion reduction is triggered by the COVID-19.
We have been doing the review of our operations across, including R&D as well.
And then some of that timing of development might have been a little bit delayed, so this spans across our automobile, motorcycles and power equipment.
So for any future plans, future activities, for the seeding for the future, we will still be continuing for the investment for future technology.
Matt Watanabe
OK.
I am sorry, but I have to say that the next question is going to be the final question from BT Kyodo.
Mr.
Higashimoto, please -- sorry, Ms.
Higashimoto.
Unknown speaker
This is Higashimoto from Kyodo.
Can you hear me?
Matt Watanabe
Yes.
Unknown speaker
About U.S presidential election, just an added question.
You said that it is premature to say anything about the future in the U.S.
The official results are not out yet.
However, the past four years under President Donald J.
Trump, how would you summarize that four-year period? There was a tax cut.
So for companies who have been really focusing on the U.S.
market, there must have been benefits that you enjoyed.
So what is your review of the past four years under President Trump in the United States?
Matt Watanabe
OK.
The review of the past four years under President Trump.
"
3600,HMC,2020,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-representative-director,False,0,"Today, I will explain the operating status of the major manufacturing sites briefly, and then we will go on to the financial results of FY 2020.
As for the forecast of the FY 2021, estimates are not finalized because, as of now, it is difficult to reasonably calculate the impact associated with the COVID-19.
Going forward, we will disclose the estimates when expectations of the consolidated results can be calculated.
Let me start.
This is the operating status of major manufacturing sites.
In association with stay-home restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic, we suspend productions in the countries listed here.
In the US, we have resumed our operations starting May 11.
In China, as per the guidelines of the local governments, we had suspended our production since Chinese New Year holidays in February, but all of the factories have resumed their normal operations by the end of April.
With regard to the factories that are suspended now, we will mind the prevention of the further contagion of the disease and keeping an eye on the safety of employees and their families, market and supply chain situations, and so on, we will consider our future operations.
Let me explain the results of our FY 2020.
With regard to the group's unit sales for FY 2020.
Motorcycles 19.34 million units.
Automobiles 4.79 units.
In life creation businesses, it was 5.701 million units sold.
Next, regarding the situations of the major market.
In Japan, the overall market enjoyed the effect of new models offered by various OEMs.
However, the market declined from last year due to the influence of consumption tax hikes.
Hondo enjoyed a good sales performance of N-BOX and others.
However, due to influence of the consumption tax hike and the restricted part supplies for new N-WGN, our unit sales went below the last year.
N-BOX series achieved the highest unit sales among other new car sales in Japan in FY 2020.
Honda accomplished the best unit sales performance with the series for consecutive three years for the first time.
In the US, the overall market declined from last year due to the impact associated with the pandemic.
Honda enjoyed the effect of Passport launch and the incremental sales of HR-V, which marked the record sales in the month of February.
Nevertheless, because of the impact associated with pandemic, our unit sales declined from last year due to a large drop in the market of our West Coast and Northwest metropolis regions where Honda usually has major unit sales.
Further, US Environmental Protection Agency recognized Honda as the best automaker for the average fuel efficiency in the United States.
In China, the overall market declined from last year due to the sluggish trend of the market as well as the impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Honda enjoyed the effect of new launches, such as Envix, Inspire, and Breeze, as well as the incremental sales of CR-V and Accord.
Despite the impact of the pandemic, we sustained the equivalent sales through the last year on the whole.
Dongfeng Honda enjoyed the effect of commissioning of the new plant to have marked the highest ever unit sales until now.
Next, of the motorcycle businesses.
In India, the largest market, due to the economic stagnation and worsening unemployment in addition to the impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer spending continued to sluggish.
The overall Asia market declined from last year.
Honda enjoyed some increase of the businesses in Vietnam and the Philippines.
However, because of slowing down India market, our businesses declined from last year.
The unit sales in Vietnam and the Philippines marked the record highest so far.
Next, when we summarize the consolidated financial results for FY '20, the operating income decreased by JPY92.7 billion from the previous year to JPY633.6 billion.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange effects and other one-time issues and the COVID-19 pandemic, the actual profit increased by JPY100.8 billion from the previous fiscal year due to cost reduction effects and the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A.
As you can see, these are the unit sales and the profit and loss situations.
Next, we have decided to pay an annual dividend of JPY112 per share for FY '20, and the dividend for the end of fourth quarter to be JPY28 per share.
The annual dividend forecast or the outlook for FY '21 has not been decided because it is currently difficult to reasonably calculate the business outlook.
Next, Kohei Takeuchi, the Senior Managing Director in charge of finance and management, will explain the details of the financial results.
"
3601,HMC,2020,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-representative-director,False,1,"So as I explained in the presentation, the outlook of the corona pandemic, it is very difficult to forecast.
So at the current stage, it is very difficult to actually calculate reasonably, what will be the outlook.
So the current situation is as follows.
As for the automobile, major production sites is -- 70% for automobile and also the 50% of the motorcycle production have resumed the operation.
And as for China, thanks to everyone's effort, Guangqi Honda in March and also Dongfeng Honda also started the operation in April.
As for the North America, the production sites in the North America and including US and Canada, started the operation from yesterday.
And as for the market situation in China, the April sales actual was 113,000 units.
That's the 90%.
And so the wholesale is more than 100%, and we are getting the orders steadily.
As for the North America, in April, it has -- the difficult situation continued, and it was year-on-year 44%, and it was 58,000 unit sales.
And as for the outlook -- as for China, due to COVID-19 pandemic impact, especially we have the production site in Wuhan.
So we have been impacted gravelly in recent situation.
Because the extension of the treatment -- preferential treatment at the China government and also the alleviation of the regulation on the number plates, the market has become vigorous again.
So for us in China, though there is a concern about the second wave or the third wave of the pandemic, but we would like to make the utmost effort to deliver the car to the customers.
As for North America and the United States, the East Coast is impacted mostly.
And also, it is where we have a very strong market.
But dealers have started the operation gradually.
On a national level, it may be the summer to earliest that all the sales activity will resume to the normal.
But we will closely communicate with the suppliers and the dealers to resume the operation as soon as possible.
So -- but we are not able to give the concrete numbers today.
That is all.
"
3602,HMC,2020,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-representative-director,False,2,"As you know, in order to have the stable supply of the parts and components in the North America, we get supplies of those globally, not just within the NA, North America.
And of course, there are state-based differences.
And in fact, there are different -- different times of the restarting of the situations as per different states, but we will watch that to have the right timing.
But we will have a close communication with the parts suppliers in the process.
And we have a corona pandemic team where the information is collected to see what is going on.
And we are in the process of collecting information globally.
And for the second one.
[Foreign Speech]
"
3603,HMC,2020,4,seiji-kuraishi,executive-vice-president-and-representative-director,False,3,
3604,HMC,2020,4,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,0,"So let me start the explanation.
First of all, regarding the summary of consolidated financial results for the three months in the fourth quarter.
As for the Honda Group's unit sales, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, in the motorcycle business, though there was an increase in Vietnam, the unit sales decreased in India, Indonesia and Thailand, and other countries.
In the automobile business, the unit sales decreased in China, the United States and India.
Next, regarding the profits and losses.
Although the sales revenue increased in the financial service businesses, due to decrease in the automobile business and other factors, the sales revenue came down to JPY3,458 billion.
As for the operating loss, although there were cost reduction effects and decrease in SG&A expenses, due to factors including sales fluctuation and decrease in profits due to change in product mix, the operating income was JPY5.6 billion [Phonetic].
Next, I will explain the factors behind the increase and decrease in profit before income taxes.
Profit before the income for the fourth quarter was JPY3.7 billion, a decrease by JPY107.3 billion from the same period of the previous year.
As for the operating profit, though there were cost reduction effects and decrease of SG&A, but due to the impact along with the COVID-19 pandemic, it was down by JPY47.9 billion compared to the same period last year.
If we exclude the foreign exchange impact and other one-time issues, it is estimated to be plus JPY32.4 billion.
The one-time issue includes the impact from the change in production organization of the automobile business.
The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic include a decrease in unit sales, an increase in sales incentive provisions and an increase in credit loss provisions in the financial business.
Next, I will explain the financial results by business segment.
As for operating income for the motorcycle businesses, despite the decrease in the unit sales, due to factors such as decrease in SG&A expenses and the effect of the cost reduction, it came down to JPY63.4 billion.
The operating loss of the automobile business came down to JPY75.6 billion due to a decrease in the unit sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and the increase in provision for sales incentives.
Operating income in the financial services business came down to JPY22.9 billion due to an increase in provision for credit losses despite an increase in operating lease sales.
The operating loss of the life creation business and other businesses was JPY16.3 billion due to the decrease in the unit sales in the United States and Thailand.
Operating loss of aircraft and aircraft engines included in life creation segment and other businesses came down to JPY13.8 billion.
Next, what you're seeing in here is the profit and loss situation for the 12 months.
To explain the factors behind the increase and/or decrease, profit before income tax was JPY789.9 billion, a decrease by JPY189.4 billion from the previous year.
The operating income was JPY633.6 billion.
Although there was a cost reduction effect due to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, it came down to -- down by JPY92.7 billion.
When we exclude the foreign exchange and one-time issues, and the impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is calculated as positive JPY100.8 billion.
Free cash flow -- excuse me.
What you see here are the actual results of the capital investment, depreciation and R&D expenditures for FY '20.
Free cash flow of operating companies for the 12 months in FY '20 turned out to be positive JPY470.6 billion, and the balance of cash and cash equivalents at the fiscal year-end is JPY2,462.6 billion.
Net cash was JPY1,930.6 billion, which is estimated to be equivalent to about 1.9 months of monthly sales.
At this point, we have no major concerns about liquidity at hand, but we will continue to secure liquidity at hand by curbing cash expenditures, such as investments and expense across globe, raising funds as appropriate.
That is all for the explanation.
Thank you very much.
"
3605,HMC,2020,4,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,1,"So I think the question is about the cash on hand.
I would like to respond.
First of all, the last -- end of the last fiscal year, we actually issued the corporate bond.
That's a three-year, five-year and seven-year.
And also the short-term commercial paper that's amount to JPY100 billion.
So in total, JPY200 billion.
So on a consolidated basis, we have JPY2.7 trillion.
But that includes the business company and also the financial companies.
We still have the sufficient cash for the business company.
And at net cash level that deducts the borrowing, we still have JPY1.9 trillion.
That is equivalent to 1.9 months of the monthly sales.
And also when we consider about the pandemic, from April and after, we actually have the borrowing from the major banks.
And currently, for the cash -- when we consider the cash on hand, there won't be any problem for the time being.
But there is the possibility that pandemic will further expand, considering the second wave and the third wave.
And if it is the case, we may have to consider about issuing the corporate bond.
We have the new credit line from the major banks.
So within that credit line, we would like to secure the liquidity on hand.
That is all.
Thank you.
"
3606,HMC,2020,4,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director,False,2,"So the pandemic, we postponed the announcement of the outlook because of the difficult situation.
How much does unit sales will be and when will the customer come back to the dealer are still uncertain.
In some regions, we've resumed the production.
And in Japan, we are continuing the production.
But in Asia, including motorcycle, there are many uncertainties.
So that is why we have actually postponed the outlook announcement.
In the past, have we actually postponed the outlook announcement before? Actually, we've actually postponed the outlook of the FY '12, because of the Great East Japan earthquake.
And as for this JPY130 billion impact on the operating income and what would be the negative impact to sales revenue.
As for this JPY130 billion impact on the operating income, let me give you the breakdown, motorcycle and automobile and life creation or the power products.
The sales unit, the impact was JPY60 billion.
And in automobile, especially in North America, the dealer closed.
So they could not sell to the customers.
So the inventory accumulated at the dealership.
And also other automakers provided the incentives.
So we also had to provide the incentive to the royal customers and also to support money to our dealership.
So we've actually booked JPY30 billion for the provisioning.
And next is the impact of the financial service.
Because of the unemployment rate increase due to the pandemic, those who are using our finance service, though they are the high-profile customers, generally speaking, because of the high unemployment rate, we had to book the bad debt allowances by consulting with our CPA.
That's the JPY40 billion.
JPY60 billion from the unit sales -- in terms of the unit sales, there's 62,000 units of the automobile and the 290,000 units of the motorcycle.
And as of the life cycle, there's 190,000 units.
So it is very difficult to calculate the sales, but it's around [Indecipherable] JPY200 billion.

From Reuters, Mr.
Shiraki.
This question to be addressed -- the question is addressed to Mr.
Hachigo.
With regard to the supply chain style, what it should be, because of the pandemic, there was a big impact on the supply chain.
The coronavirus was initiated in China where you have a big dependency on.
And some people talk about possible repatriation of the production and also the centralized supplies.
And some government is supporting the idea.
And Honda has advanced scheme of local supplies and local production among other automotive companies.
But do you have an idea to review the supply chain principles because of the coronavirus pandemic today? And if you have any idea for repatriation of some parts supplies, for instance, if that is especial, please tell us specifically.
And if doing so, would that be the factor for cost increase, would that be to be accepted? Or if you are not going to view that, please tell me with the reasons for that.

What will be the model of the mobility service? And what will be the one that will have the higher demand? The recent years, the users are switching from owning to the usage.
But after the pandemic, what would the situation change from...? In order to prevent the infection, people try to avoid the closeness, free closeness.
And also in overseas, the Uber and Lyft, and all the ride shares have been suspended in the major cities.
And the use of the taxies in public transportation in the country has been in a declining trend.
We don't know where the pandemic will converge.
We may have to co-exist with COVID-19.
And there may be the concern of the new virus coming up.
So what will be the value of the automobile in that case? There had been the popularity in SUV.
But in order to avoid a contact with other people, so the more economic -- compact, aiming for the short-distance ride may have the bigger demand.
Or do you think that when the situation comes back to normal, it will go back to the conventional manner? What will be the new model that may have the higher demand in the mobility service?

From Nikkei Shimbun, Mr.

In April, you consolidated the Honda Motor Company and the development -- development of the automobile of the Honda R&D.

But what is the overall directions and overall feeling or estimates, so to say? And of course, you have successfully managed through the financial crisis and Great East Japan earthquakes, with the profits always on the book.
Please also tell us about China and the US production and sales.
The answer, Hachigo is speaking.
"
3617,HMC,2020,4,watanabe,corporate-publications,False,9,"So as for the second question, that is the overall direction and also the trend of the major market.
Mr.
Kuraishi, could you respond?
"
3618,HMC,2020,4,watanabe,corporate-publications,False,10,"Next is from Mr.
Inagi [Phonetic] of the Asahi Newspaper.
So this year, the Honda is scheduling to introduce the autonomous driving level 3 model, Honda e.
But would there be the delay in the launch due to the corona COVID-19 pandemic? The second question is because of the pandemic, many companies are trying to secure the cash on hand.
What measures are you taking? Do you think the current cash level is sufficient? Please also respond.
So the first question is from Hachigo.
"
3619,HMC,2020,4,watanabe,corporate-publications,False,11,"And the second question, Mr.
Takeuchi is going to answer.
"
3620,HMC,2020,4,watanabe,corporate-publications,False,12,"So next is from Automotive News, Mr.
Hans Greimel.
The first question is, what is the preferred approach to restarting the industry in [Indecipherable] like the US, where every state has its own lockdown rules? Does there need to be better interstate the coordination to bring suppliers back into operation? And the second question is, the coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous financial pain.
Will that change how you invest in futuristic technologies that have no immediate payoff, such as autonomous driving and electrification? Are you delaying investment into these areas?
So the first question will be answered by Mr.
Kuraishi.
"
3621,HMC,2020,4,watanabe,corporate-publications,False,13,"[Foreign Speech]
Next question is given from Mr.
Oshikiri from Nikkei Shimbun.
Question one.
Expectations of the first quarter, April through June, its performance, and I'd like to know how you view that expectation, including the free cash flow.
And what is your measures to have additional cash in hand?
We've answered that question already.
And for the second question of his.
Up until the 2022, your plan is to reform your automobile operations structure to adapt to the production capacity below 5 million.
However, because of the corona pandemic, you might need to speed up the process of the structural reform because of the global demands being sluggish.
If you have additional idea for the rationalization and so forth, please tell us about it.
Mr.
Hachigo.
"
3622,HMC,2020,4,watanabe,corporate-publications,False,14,"Next is from Mr.
Shimosato [Phonetic] of Yomiuri.
The first question is, why did you to postpone the announcement of the outlook for the FY '21? And when was the last time you postponed the announcement of the outlook? And how do you estimate the sales target of the automobile and what is required for the recovery of the sales? And so the pandemic impact to the operating profit, it's estimated to be JPY129.8 billion.
But what will be the negative impact to your sales revenue? The second question is the operating income margin for the automobile business is 1.5%.
That is very low compared to the margin for the motorcycle business, which is 13.9%.
What is your future measure in terms of the improvement of the margin?
First question by Mr.
Takeuchi.
"
3623,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,0,"Good afternoon, everyone.
I am Hachigo.
Thank you very much, indeed, for sparing your time for us today despite your busy schedule.
Before presenting our financial summary, I would like to make some remarks.
First of all, I would like to express my condolences for all those people in the world who lost their lives due to COVID-19 as well as my deepest sympathies for those people who are infected and their families.
And in addition, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude for the healthcare professionals who fight against the hardships at the front line every day and to the essential workers who keep on supporting our lives at places such as public transportation systems and super markets.
In order to prevent a further spread of the local coronavirus infections, Honda is trying to take advantage of our manufacturing capabilities to serve the society by producing the transfer vehicles for the infected, or parts or components of the face shield and ventilator systems.
We are trying to do everything we can now at various regional operations.
By the way, today's press conference for our financial result is different.
Instead of the usual style, we hold this meeting using Internet.
Due to the influence of the novel coronavirus pandemic, we also are under the difficult environment presently.
The financial results following after my talk indeed is very difficult.
As of today, we also have decided to put off our disclosing of our full-year estimates for the current financial year because of the work of the estimation being too difficult.
When it becomes possible to estimate our consolidated financial results and expectations, we will disclose the information for you.
Although unclear and uncertain situation continues, we have embarked on our efforts aimed at solidifying existing businesses with the automobile business as the core, as we explained at the corporate update last year.
We are proceeding with the preparation for further growth in the future, including the Honda eMaaS, which we introduced at the Honda meeting.
And from last month, we have started a new organization, an operation system to implement them.
However, the grave impact that the coronavirus has had on the world must make a big difference, not only in our business environment, but also in the people's values in the future.
In addition to the various measures that Honda is currently deploying, we would like to establish new business policies, which are viable to respond to any changes that may occur in the future.
We will schedule a conference to give you the explanation on this matter as soon as we are ready.
Honda has repeatedly faced great difficulties and has overcome them each time.
This time, again, the situation is very tough, but we are confident that team Honda will work as one to overcome this difficult situation.
And as soon as this difficult situation is over, we will endeavor so that the industry on the whole can provide brighter topics.
We ask for your cooperation.
Thank you very much.
"
3624,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,1,"And as you said, in April, we made a big change of the organization of the Honda Motor Company and the automobile operations.
That is to strengthen the automobile businesses and to strengthen the R&D.
And with regard to the automobile production operations -- automobile business operations, excuse me, we had S-E-D-B elements, as we always say.
And those are independent.
And then we had them in collaboration with each other based on the independent functions of each.
And now we changed the total system so that they can be more closely collaborating together in the consolidated system.
Because what is unique about Honda's product development with regard to S-E-D-B, we actually had a good advantage of that because we had a good team of those four elements.
However, we had bigger businesses now today.
And naturally, we had a tendency where the department-specific orientation sort of highlighted.
And then as a result, the efforts for coordination between the departments and the duplication of the work seen in many different places that was the duplicates, waste.
And also, because of the collaboration organization, it was not easy to see who is really responsible for certain efforts.
However, instead of that system now, we have the integrated organization this way all the way through the product development, R&D all the way to the production and sales.
We have the thorough operations with which we have a clear understanding of who is responsible.
This way, we can make a quicker decision and then optimize the business operations in the best way.
And this was why and how we strengthened our automobile business operations.
The other thing is R&D strengthening.
Until now, at R&Ds, they developed a product, assuming it will be produced for mass production.
At the same time, they assumed the responsibility to have the innovation too.
However, we have a big business now.
Because of that, they are required of 100% perfection for the quality for the business.
At the same time, if you look at the innovation part, you would have to give in like some failures in order to make a very good success of the innovations.
And then in order to have the most appropriate operations for both end, we had our unique R&D operations.
However, because of the size of the business now, we have such a global operation being big.
That means a lot of mass production-oriented technology highlighted where innovation is rather weaker.
And then we decided to consolidate mass production-related technology development, together with the automobile business operations, whereas we can keep on going for the innovations to produce the strong products of Honda going forward.
This way, we can strengthen our products in the future.
And this is the reason we integrated automobile development in the Honda Motor Company.
And now in R&D, they can focus on the new value creation, innovation more.
This was the way we changed our organization and strength -- in order to strengthen the automobile business and R&D.
In terms of its effect, in fact, this new organization started only in the last one month.
So I can't say the effect right, too soon at the moment.
But we've done the development of motorcycles and Suzuka development in the area for the many cars, certain cars.
I think we can -- we will be able to see some impact, specifically for those.
And in a way, it is a difficult start for the new organization.
However, we should take this as an opportunity to strengthen our organization for the good benefits.
And if you look at the automobile business on the whole, despite in the pandemic situations, what is the investment to be kept up through this situation? I talked about the efforts to firmly solidifying the existing businesses.
For instance, optimizing the production globally and the hybrid system introductions and Honda Architecture introduction as well.
And also, we can commonize the models across the different creations.
And also, we can reduce the number of derivatives, so to say.
And in those areas, I'd like to speedily take up our initiatives.
And in terms of current business situations, we will look at the priorities once again and the current situation so that we can take up the ones with the priorities first.
However, as I said earlier, R&D has been rebounded let's say from April, and investment in there is going to be the one for the future.
Therefore, despite difficulties we experience, we will continue to invest in the R&D all along.
"
3625,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,2,"So the questions about level 3 autonomous driving.
In the -- on the highways in limited conditions, hands-on driving technology has been established so far.
As of now, as for the collateralization, we are looking at the social acceptance of the system because the customer has to understand how to use it, depending on which the way to appeal the technology and the way to sell the technology, the product is different.
And we have already started taking orders from Europe for the technology from September last year.
And our plan is to launch the technology, Honda e technology in Europe by the end of this year.
And because of the corona pandemic, there are some concerns about some component supplies, and we need to confirm and finalize the supply situations.
Therefore, that might delay the modularization [Phonetic] finally.
However, we try to manage, and we hope that we can launch that by the end of the year.
And when timing comes, where we can give you the right information, we will share that with you.
"
3626,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,3,"As for the investment at the next-generation technologies, in order for us to survive, this is what we have to do.
So at the current stage, we don't have any plan to delay or reduce the investment there.
In terms of the funding, we are in a difficult situation.
However, we will actually review the priorities set in the current business plans and decide which one to go and which one to hold.
But those are the investments that we need in order to survive, and we will continue to invest.
But due to the pandemic, how the automotive driving should be and electrification should be may change due to the change in the people's sense of values.
So the direction that we are aiming, though the basic are the same, where we need to grow and may need to be reviewed and modified.
So once we make the decision on that, we will allocate appropriate investment.
But as for the investment for the future, we would like to steadily make investment so that we are making -- in order to do so, we are making our best effort.
Thank you very much.
"
3627,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,4,"So with regard to the optimizing the production capacity, we've talked about them in the past.
And 2022 is our target here, where the global full capacity is to be optimized, including China.
And that initiative is to be pushed forward as planned.
And in terms of the additional rationalization initiatives, rather than the rationalization, maybe I've touched upon that before, but in terms of the North American manufacturing sites, in fact, it is rather complicated today.
Therefore, specifically for the manufacturing site in that region, I'd like to simplify the structure.
And light truck vehicles and passenger cars, those are the type of the product they produce in North America.
And I would like to have the flexibility of those productions.
For instance, three models in one plant and two -- one model in two plants.
We try to keep the allocations of those models in the plants.
But finally, we like to have the most efficient allocation of the model production in North America.
But including the changes we're experiencing today, we would like to accelerate the process finally.
And basically, the principle is as I said before, we will optimize the production capacity globally.
At the same time, we can improve -- we want to improve the efficiency of the production in North America.
Thank you.
"
3628,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,5,"As for the op margin improvement of the automobile business and solidifying the current business -- existing business, we have actually introduced various measures last year.
So the current measures, the timing is 2022 or 2025, where we will see the outcome, and that is what we are proceeding.
In order to harvest in 2022 and '25, we will actually optimize the production performance globally.
So we will consolidate the production size all over the world.
So we'll make them full utilization by 2022.
And as for the hybrid, by expanding the eMaaS, we will continue to reduce the cost.
Aiming at 25% cost reduction by '25 -- excuse me, '22.
As for '25, we will introduce the Honda Architecture and also share the regional model.
And also, we will reduce the derivatives from the global model by one-third.
So by 2025, we will actually reduce the development efforts, including the development and also the procurement by one-third.
And those reduction will be used to contribute to the future R&D.
And also in North America, we will improve the efficiency of the production sites.
And by doing so, by 2025, in the production -- manufacturing area, production area, what we call the internal production area, we will reduce the production cost by 10%.
That is the plan that we have.
In any case, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many challenges.
So we will review the business plan on hand.
And in a speedy manner, we will like to embark on solidifying the existing automobile business.
That is all.
Thank you.
"
3629,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,6,"So speaking about the supply chain, when we had the Great East Japan earthquakes, we had a big impact on the supply chain, which stopped the production entirely, and we had addressed the situation.
We managed that situation too.
But in case of the corona pandemic this time, abruptly, what we are trying to address is not full enough, not sufficient yet.
And when we have a manufacturing site in one place only, then we would have to transfer that to the alternative sites.
However, it is difficult to do that altogether, including the parts supply issues associated.
We now experience that difficulty again.
And of course, there are things we can do, the low-hanging fruits, for instance.
We could do some efforts of this kind.
However, not everything.
There are things which may take time.
And in terms of the cars produced in Japan, I would like to ask the Japanese suppliers to give supplies continually so that we can have a stable supplies or we try to have regional support for that as well.
However, we haven't decided anything now.
The thing is that we need to have all the parts and components in place and be ready for the production of a car without any missing that we would not -- it would not be possible.
But we'd like to try to review whatever possible to make sure the production of the car is always possible.
And in the last fiscal year, we had parts issues of the N-WGN, which caused big problems for the customers.
So, of course, rather than cost, quality and stable supplies are paramount.
And we really feel that way.
Therefore, if needed -- cost, if needed, may have to be accepted in order to make sure the right supply chain is established.
However, nothing is really decided specifically, but that is a direction going forward.
Thank you.
"
3630,HMC,2020,4,takahiro-hachigo,president-and-representative-director,False,7,"So as was explained, due to the pandemic of the COVID-19, many people feel pain of not being able to move.
I feel that everyone in the world is feeling that way.
And also, we had the concern of being close to the people and be in a crowded situation.
So rather than going back to the situation before, we have the challenges such as the over population in the major cities.
So changing all these may become the top priority challenge in all over the world.
That is what we think.
So in this situation, safe and secure personal mobility, which can be done in a flexible manner, may have the higher demand.
And rather than being concentrated in the major cities, the distributed community may -- has to be established all over the world.
So when we consider about the distributed community, as was asked in the question, this short distance personal mobility service may be the good concept.
When we explained about the eMaaS, using the regenerative energy, using both the motorcycle, automobile and life cycle products, and converging and choosing all these, mobility and also being environmentally friendly products and services can be delivered.
Though the SUV is still popular, however, the one that is more personal and more affordable mobility services may grow in terms of the demand.
So since Honda has motorcycle, automobile, life cycle -- life business and also the jet products, so we'd like to prepare for the future.
That is all.
Thank you.

As for the revision of the information, I would like to ask you in detail about the full year outlook.
As for SG&A reduction, so is that because of the US payment of the incentive? And what are other factors that contributed to this? And also, the operating profit, so you have one outlook that shows the increase in operating profit.
But because of the coronavirus, you may have the stagnation in the production of China that may cause a negative impact.
Do you think that will actually drive down the profit increase that you were planning? What's your plan?

A question again about China.
So by listening to your answers, as of today, you said that -- my impression is that there's not much impact.
However, how do you see the impact to the sales? As of today, including Wuhan, the customers are not working around outside.
So from the consumer sentiment's point of view, how do you see the impact to the sales of automobile in China? That's number one.
And the second is, you mentioned about the factory, just a confirmation of what you said.
Wuhan's production line, I think, NHK's person asked about the refurbishment of the production line.
Is this the one that was originally planned? And it didn't plan for the refurbishment because the production is also stopped.
So was this the one that was planned from before, like in the annual plan?

3636,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,0,"To start with, I would first like to express my condolences for the families of the deceased due to the novel coronavirus outbreak as well as my deepest sympathy for the patients and for those who feel concerned.
I hope that things will be back to the normal status as quickly as possible.
Honda has postponed restarting of the operations at our affiliate companies since February 3.
Currently, as per the guidelines given by the Chinese local government, we are closely monitoring safety of our employees and their families, and the status of the supply chain, and are considering our operations going forward.
At the moment, it is difficult to estimate its impact on our financial performance.
Therefore, the forecast we share today does not reflect it.
Let me explain the financial results of the third quarter FY 2020.
To start with, cumulative unit sales until third quarter this year of Honda Group is as follows.
Motorcycles, 15.038 million units; automobiles, 3.809 million units; Life Creation, 3.63 million units.
Next, regarding the situations of the main markets.
Total automotive market in Japan enjoyed effective launches of the new models by OEMs, but due to consumption tax hikes and other factors, the market declined year-on-year.
Honda enjoyed a good sales of N-Boxs, however, due to part supply restrictions for new N-WGN, our unit sales declined year-on-year.
Total market for FY 2020 will end slightly lower than the year before, but based on good sales performance of N-BOX and Freed, Honda has up-revised unit sales forecast.
Brand new Fit will be announced on the 13th of February and be launched in the market on the 14th of February.
Please keep up with the expectations.
In the US, total market results are slightly below year-on-year.
Despite the sedan market's shrinking trend and the decline of the Accord sales, Honda launched Passport effectively and HR-V sales increased with the record highest monthly sales performance in October, thus we maintained equivalent sales results to that of the same time last year.
Civic kept a tough position in the segment consecutively for 10 months.
CR-V renewed monthly sales record in October and November.
Total market in FY 2020 will result slightly below 17 million units.
Honda will try to grow well-performing light trucks such as HR-V and CR-V so we can exceed the sales of last year.
In China, total market dropped in all segments.
Honda increased CR-V and Accord and so on with effective new model launches, such as Envix, Inspire and Breeze.
We achieved better unit sales results year-on-year.
Total market of calendar year 2020 would slightly be below the year before.
Honda will continue monitoring the impact of novel coronavirus outbreak.
Meanwhile, we will aim to maximize sales results by incremental sales of our leading models and new launches.
Regarding motorcycle segment, in India, the largest market, the economy stagnates, the employment rate worsens, which slows down personal spending.
Total markets in Asia decreased year-on-year.
Honda has had more sales in the Philippines.
However, due to slowing down India market, our result was below the same time last year.
Regarding total market in Asia in FY 2020 full year, since personal spending in India market still remains at low level, recovery will be difficult, so our performance would end up below last year.
In India, we launched Activa 125, which complies the new regulations as well as the new SP 125 and Activa 6G, aiming at further growth.
In Brazil, total market is in recovery trend.
We will strengthen our sales, mainly with the commuter models.
In December 2019, Honda marked the global cumulative unit sales of motorcycles of 400 million units.
We will keep doing our best going forward to supply attractive products that are fulfilling for needs and dreams of customers in various parts of the world.
This is the summary of the cumulative results until third quarter this year.
Operating profit was JPY639.2 billion, down by JPY44.7 billion year-on-year.
Excluding foreign currency and temporary impact, thanks to currency down effect and SGA reductions, operating profit went up by JPY68.2 billion.
Unit sales and P&L are shown on this slide.
With regard to the FY 2020 full-year forecast, expected operating profit would be JPY730 billion, with additional JPY40 billion to the last forecast update.
Due to foreign currency impact, economic downturn in India and the limited parts supplies in Japan, unit sales would reduce from last year.
Nevertheless, we will ensure to execute actions for profit improvement to keep the plans higher than the year before.
Unit sales and PL are on this slide.
For FY 2020, expected annual dividends would be JPY112 per share.
As we announced last time, third quarter dividend is JPY28 per share.
Next, Mr.
Takeuchi, Senior Managing Director and CFO, will present details of the financial performance and further expectations.

3637,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,1,"As for Dongfeng Honda's operation, the current plan is to resume the production on February 14.
First, we will take one week to refurbish the production line, which was originally scheduled to do in Chinese New Year.
And as for the resumption of the production, in parallel with the refurbishment of the production line, we will confirm the safety of the employees, condition of the facilities and also the supply status of the parts and components, and proceed with the preparation so that we can start the production on the week of February 17.
Together with the speeding up of the refurbishment of the production line, we will try our best to restart our production.
Next is Guangqi Honda.
The current plan is to resume the production on February 10.
Same as Donghu Honda, we will first check the current status and start the production as soon as possible.

Questions and Answers:
Operator
So now I'd like to move on to the Q&A.
Please raise your hands if you have questions.
As I always ask you, we will bring you the microphone, please tell us your name and which company you're from, and we will take the English questions, if you like.
So please raise your hand if you have questions.
So the gentleman at the front, please.
Unidentified Participant
Earlier, you -- continuing from your explanation, according to the newspaper reports, the annual capacity of the Wuhan plant is about 600,000 cars, but what is the plan? Do you have any plans to compensate for the no car production for the time being? And another question is how many employees are working at the Wuhan plant and how many are Japanese working there? What is the ratio of the Japanese employee there?
"
3638,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,2,"Well, my understanding might be a little different.
On the 10th of February, we are going to assume the operation, as I said earlier.
As I said, safety of the employees, suppliers' situation in terms of the safety and quality, we need to confirm everything around here before we resume.
And I wouldn't say that we're going to start a full-scale production on the 10th right away, but we would have to confirm along with a resumption to get started.
But in the Guangqi Honda, they probably -- or they do get the parts and components from Hubei province.
And we need to confirm the supply chain, first of all, before we start our production.
Unidentified Speaker
Thank you very much.
Well, we still have some time.
The two gentleman raising their hands, we can address your questions.
"
3639,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,3,"For the factory, first.
So during the Chinese New Year, we were planning to refurbish the production line, but we had to hold this, stop this.
For example, on 14th, when the employees and parts are all ready, however, we still have to do this refurbishment of the production line.
Please understand this.
So as for the impact of the sales, at the current state, it is very difficult to answer.
I was in China and I asked the Chinese people, and as for the Hubei province and other provinces, the situations are totally different.
So in that environment, the sales dealers -- some dealers have opened their businesses already.
And sales in China is very strong.
In January, the calendar -- though the calendar is shorter than before, we've achieved a 1.15 million units of sales, and we have a big backlog, 150,000 units, correction.
If the situation prolongs, of course, that may cause impact to the consumer sentiment.
However, as of today, we have to closely look at the situation.
Looking from the opposite manner, because our sales was in a really favorable situation, we did not have that much inventory.
So if the production delayed, that may cause the sales.
But as for the motorcycles and power products, we have very high level of inventory.
So even if the production stops, we -- the sales will not stop.
So that is, in this sense, the impact to the Automobile business is much higher.
Unidentified Speaker
Last question, please.
"
3640,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,4,"So, well, we are not necessarily go on either side of the litigating parties or those partnership of the litigations.
One is the consistent long-term rules, that's what we want to have.
And if there are two rules, that means we need to adapt to that with the two sets of the [indecipherable], that is not efficient at all.
And together with the California -- State of California, of course, we'd like to come up with the integrated, consistent single rule that is good for the environment as well, and that is the proposition that we make.
And then to that proposition, the government is in a way, litigating.
And we're not necessarily -- we don't necessarily like to go either side of that.
Nevertheless, what we want to see is a single rule, not one side or the other.

But based on the schedule that we explained earlier, if we can resume the production, then the impact will not be that big, especially the operating profit.
As you know, the impact in China is very small.
So we don't think this will impact us.
But if this will prolong, that is a different story.
So there's nothing we can say today.
Thank you.
Unidentified Participant
I'd like to ask about the coronavirus issues on the supply chain effect in China of course, parts will be -- parts produced in China and then they are used elsewhere out of China.
What is the impact by that?
"
3644,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,8,"So in terms of the supply chain we will -- we would be able to resume the production as planned.
If that is the case, it would not stop the line elsewhere.
At the moment, we are scrutinizing its impact closely now.
But going forward, we will watch and monitor the situations and then make a judgment about the production line elsewhere.
Unidentified Speaker
Any other question? The gentleman in the front row.
"
3645,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,9,"As for the pause from China, actually, because of the lead time, the supply situation may differ.
However, in any case, there is a certain amount of inventory for each parts and the level differ by the parts and components.
We are doing the close investigation and confirmation, so we do not have the -- we cannot say when the production stops.
However, in any case, we will try to minimize the impact.
And in each region, we may change the order of the production so that we can continue the operation of the production line, but nothing has been decided yet, so it is very difficult for us to explain today.
And as for the light truck situation in the US, as you know already, in the United States, the ratio of light truck at December is 74%.
Each OEM have been launching the new models and the incentive is at the highest level, so that is why the light truck is increasing.
In case of Honda, the light truck ratio is 60%, thanks to everyone's effort.
And last year, the total market was down.
However, as for Honda, both sedan and Civic and Accord were in a very favorable situation, and we have the new Passport and CR-V.
And in last year, we were able to exceed the last year's figure.
So currently, we don't have any plan to change the lineup drastically.
However, we will see the market trend, so that we can provide a product that is enjoyed by the customer.
Okay.
Unidentified Speaker
Next, gentlemen behind the table please.
Wait a second.
I will bring the microphone.
Unidentified Participant
Speaking about Chinese plant.
Two questions, one is Wuhan plant, these modification plans.
Is that perhaps the plans already in place? And what is the kind of the modification, how much modification is still left? You have two plants in Wuhan.
And do you have that modification plan in two of the plants?
"
3646,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,10,"Well, I cannot share with you the details of the modification plan of the plants, but it is about a new model-related work, plus the maintenance-related works at the plant.
And it is not necessarily to be done in all of the plants.
It is to be done as per different processes and we have plans which we pursue.
In fact, after the holidays started, we had some works already started.
However, it was suspended halfway through.
And apparently, the processes of the work is kind of variably completed.
But going forward, I'd like to resume the work as soon as possible so that we can accelerate the process going forward.
We are, at the moment, coordinating for that.
Unidentified Participant
And I have another question about quantity.
Honda, you say that you're going to resume the production on the 10th of February.
But on the 10th, on the day of the start of the resumption of the operation, do you start production right away?
"
3647,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,11,"Well, as I said earlier, in our Guangqi Honda, we need to confirm the safety of the employees as well as the parts, component supplies from the suppliers.
First of all, we need to check them.
Therefore, it may be difficult to get into the full scale production right away.
But when we are ready with the employees and everything else, we will be able to start the production in full on the day 1.
However, at the moment, it is difficult to say that.
Unidentified Speaker
Okay.
Any other question? So the gentlemen at the second row.
"
3648,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,12,"First of all, so the production in China, as you may know already, even if one component is missing, you cannot produce the car.
So unless we confirm, we cannot say anything right now.
As for the inventory, usually, we have three days inventory, that's the usual level in average.
Depending on the parts, we actually get this spread a lot.
But for the components, it's usually on a three days inventory.
Unidentified Speaker
So was your question about the growth strategy? How we draw the growth strategy in the long-term beyond 2020?
"
3649,HMC,2020,3,seiji-kuraishi,"chief-operating-officer,-representative-director,-vice-president-and-general-manager,-automobile",False,13,"For us, we have the 2030 vision, which we've drawn.
And in order to achieve this, we are proceeding.
So toward this 2030 vision, we have to achieve this vision for sure.
So Hachigo, our President, has explained about our strategy such as the electrification that is we are targeting 2030 to actually electrify the vehicle of two-third of our total product.
And toward all the strategies, we would like to proceed further.

Other questions please.
If not, excuse me, last question there.
"
3650,HMC,2020,3,sean-mclain,wall-street-journal,True,0,"Sean McLain for the Wall Street Journal.
Two questions, one on China, you explained a little bit about, if you resume quickly, then this is not a problem.
Given the supply that's [Technical Issues] Chinese market, about how long do you think this will go on [Technical Issues] to have an impact on your business? How many months of supply do you have before it would start to have an impact? And secondly, on the US business, your sedan and truck balance, still barely 50-50.
Is there going to be -- are you contemplating any further changes to your production lineup to increase production of trucks and SUVs in the US?

Operator
And Jiro Morisawa, Chief Officer and Business Management Operations.
So, let's start with the presentation for the financial results.
Mr.
Kuraishi, please?
"
3653,HMC,2020,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,1,"So let me explain, first of all, for the FY '20 third quarter financial results.
As for the sales revenue, so there was a sense of Financial Service business increase.
However, due to the decrease of the sales in the Automobile business and due to the negative impact of the exchange, it turned out to JPY3,747.5 billion.
As for operating profit, though there was a reduction in SG&A and effect from the cost reduction but because of the sales decline and also the model mix changes, it came to JPY166.6 billion.
Next is the change in profit before income tax.
As for the profit before tax for FY '20 third quarter, it turned to JPY206.7 billion.
That is down by JPY20.1 billion compared to the same period last year.
And the operating profit was JPY166.6 billion, that's down by JPY3.4 billion.
So the operating profit, excluding the currency effect, owing to the reduction of the quality-related expense was increased by JPY36.5 billion.
Next is our financial results by business segments.
As for the operating profit for the Motorcycle business, the slowdown of the India market pushed our unit sales down.
Owing to the cost reduction effort, it came at JPY74.5 billion.
As to the operating profit for the Automobile businesses, due to the unit sales reduction in Japan impacted by the supply restriction of components in plastic, came down to JPY33.7 billion.
As for the operating profit for the Financial Service business, increase of operating lease revenue contributed and came as JPY64.5 billion.
The operating loss from the Life Creation business and other businesses, due to the unit sales decline in the United States, came at JPY6.1 billion.
As for the operating loss from the aircraft and aircraft engines included in the Life Creation and other businesses, came as JPY10 billion.
Combined operating profit of the Automobile business and Automobile sales included in the Financial Service business is JPY95.2 billion, according to our calculation.
Next FY '20 and nine months consolidated financial results.
To explain the factors that contributed to this change, the profit before income tax is JPY786.1 billion.
That is down by JPY82 billion from the same period last year.
Operating profit was JPY639.2 billion, that's down by JPY44.7 billion compared to the same period last year.
As for the operating profit, excluding the exchange effect owing to the cost reduction effort and the decrease of the quality-related expense, it came to positive JPY46 billion.
Next is the Honda Group consolidated financial focus for FY '20.
First, the Honda Group unit sales forecast.
Motorcycle, no change from the previous forecast, that's 19.9 million units; Automobile, increased by 5,000 units to 4.98 million units; Life Creation business, decreased by 270,000, and that's 6 million units.
FY '20 consolidated financial forecast is shown on this slide.
Next is the change in FY '20 operating profit forecast from FY '19 result.
Due to the unit sales decline and the change in sales and model mix and also the negative exchange impact there is still because of the cost down reduction and SG&A reduction, we are planning for the OP forecast of the JPY730 billion.
Next is the change from the previous forecast.
Due to the reduction of the SG&A and also exchange impact, our operating profit forecast this time is plus JPY40 billion.
Our FY '20 forecast for capital expenditure, depreciation and R&D expenditures are shown on the table.
In the Board of Director meeting today, in order to maintain the liquidity on hand and secure a fund for the future growth, we've decided to issue the straight corporate bond in Japan.
The upper ceiling of the total amount of the corporate bond for subscription is JPY100 billion.
That is all for the explanation.
Thank you very much.
Unidentified Speaker
Thank you.
Continuing, before we start the question-and-answer, we are going to explain -- Mr.
Kuraishi will be explaining about when we can restart the production of the automobile plant in China.
"
3654,HMC,2020,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,2,"And as for the questions about Wuhan, Dongfeng Honda Automobile Company, we have our employees, about 12,700 as of the end of December, including -- excuse me.
I don't know how many Japanese included in there.
The Corporate Communications Department will let you know after confirmation.
We don't necessarily separate, but we have about expats -- 430 expats from Japan in China.
That's the total number of Japanese expats over there.
Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.
Any other questions? So gentlemen who is holding the glass at the back.
"
3655,HMC,2020,3,kohei-takeuchi,senior-managing-director-and-chief-financial-officer,False,3,"So as for the operating profit full year outlook, that was at JPY690 billion, but now it's JPY730 billion.
That's increased by JPY40 billion.
And let me explain the breakdown.
First, is the exchange impact, that's JPY15 billion.
And the reason is, in the third quarter actual, originally, in the budget, it was JPY105 to the dollar, but now it's JPY109 to the dollar in actual or JPY108, no, JPY109 in the third quarter.
In full year, it's JPY107, but that became to JPY108.
So that is why the JPY15 billion plus.
And others include, as Okada [indecipherable] just explained, in SG&A, we have some positive.
And we have JPY26 billion amount of the Latin America's social security burden.
And also, the tax reimbursement was given, and that contributed positive to the SG&A.
And number three is in a vehicle -- in Automobile, we have some plus in Japan and plus in the Motorcycle, but the biggest one are the exchange impacts and also the SG&A and the tax reimbursement, so that actually reduced SG&A cost.

Two questions.
Number one, as for Wuhan factory, you mentioned that you are starting to recover the 17th.
But with it, you go back to the full production from 17th or will you be actually trying to increase gradually? You mentioned that you are closely investigating, but the inventory differ by model, as you said.
So in your close investigation, what will be the shortest one? And in the long run, including the stock price, currently, the situation is very difficult.
However, we heard that there is no equity story, so called.
But since this fiscal year has not ended, so in FY '20, how you can actually -- you can show the growth strategy? And can you explain more in detail about your growth strategy?

Again, questions about China, sorry.
In Guangzhou, it is awkward to say, but I thought you kind of resumed the production earlier than expected.
Toyota, for instance, they said they're going to postpone the resumption of the production another week.
And in China, current environment of the businesses, for instance, how do you view that? According to the suppliers, in Guangzhou, it is difficult to get laborers, people because quite a few of those laborers come from outside of the province, other than Guangzhou.
And the production capacity -- operation utilization is rather lower because of that.
But how do you judge the environment outside and then how did you come to make that judgment?

I'd like to ask a question in English.
I have a question about the United States and the market there.
There's a discussion going on in the United States now about California emissions rules.
And on one side, you have the group that's supporting California emissions, and Honda is a member of that coalition.
On the other side, you have, I think, General Motors and Honda, which are supporting kind of the Trump administration's rules.
Why is Honda supporting the California emissions rules? Why do you see value in doing that? What's in it for your company? And why take side in this discussion?

So can you know when do you start to come in for the price increase for battery? And because you mentioned the battery price increased by 30%.
Is it from the January 1st or start from second quarter? If the first quarter already considering the price increase of the battery, you also actually increased price start from April 1st.
It does mean the second quarter a marginal further increase.

Hello, everyone.
I will now go over some of our financial results for the first quarter of 2022.
To be mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage you to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2022 were RMB 9.56 billion or $1.51 billion.
representing an increase of 167.5% from RMB 3.58 billion in the first quarter of 2021.
This included RMB 9.31 billion or $1.47 billion of vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 168.7% from the first quarter of last year.
The increase in vehicle sales over the first quarter of 2021 was mainly attributable to the increase in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2022.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, total revenues and vehicles, vehicle sales decreased 10% and 10.3%, respectively primarily due to the decrease in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2022.
Revenues from other sales and services were RMB 253.4 million or $40 million in the first quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 127.2% from RMB 111.5 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 3.6% from RMB 244.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The increase in revenue from other sales and services over the first quarter of 2021 was mainly attributable to the increased sales of charging stalls, accessories, and services in line with higher accumulated vehicle sales.
Cost of sales in the first quarter of 2022 was RMB 7.4 billion, or $1.17 billion, representing an increase of 150.1% year over year and a decrease of 10.2% quarter over quarter.

Vehicle margin in the first quarter of 2022 was 22.4%, compared with 16.9% in the same quarter of 2021 and 22.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The increase in vehicle margin over the first quarter of 2021 was driven by higher average selling price attributable to the increase in vehicle deliveries of 2021 Li ONE since its release in May 2021.
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2022 was 22.6%, compared to 17.3% in the first quarter of last year and 22.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2022 were RMB 1.37 billion or $216.7 million, representing an increase of 167% year over year and an increase of 11.7% quarter over quarter.
The increase in research and development expenses over the first quarter of last year was primarily driven by the increased employee compensation as a result of our growing number of research and development staff as well as increased costs associated with new product development.
The increase in research and development expenses over the fourth quarter of last year was mainly driven by increased employee compensation.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were RMB 1.2 billion or $189.8 million, representing an increase of 135.9% year over year and an increase of 6.8% quarter over quarter.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the first quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by increased employee compensation as a result of our growing number of staff as well as increased marketing and promotion activities and rental expenses associated with the expansion of the company's sales network.
Loss from operations in the first quarter of 2022 was RMB 413.1 million or $65.2 million, compared with RMB 407.7 million loss from operations in the first quarter of 2021, and RMB 24.1 million income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Net loss was RMB $10.9 million or $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared with RMB 360 million net loss in the first quarter of 2021 and RMB 295.5 million net income in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits, and short-term investments totaled RMB 51.19 billion or $8.07 billion as of March 31st, 2022.
Operating cash flow in the first quarter of 2022, was RMB 1.83 billion or $289.3 million.
Free cash flow was RMB $502 million or $79.2 million in the first quarter of 2022.
And now for our business outlook.
For the first -- for the second quarter of 2022, the company expects the deliveries to be between 21,000 and 24,000 vehicles, representing an increase of 19.5% to 36.6% from the second quarter of 2021.
The company also expects second quarter total revenues to be between RMB 6.16 billion and RMB 7.04 billion or $972.3 million and $1.11 billion, representing an increase of 22.3% to 39.8% from the second quarter of last year.
This business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition.
In particular, the encouraging signs of recovery from the resurging pandemic in the Yangtze Delta region, which are all subject to change due to uncertainties related to factors such as the pace of the pandemic recovery, among others.
I will now turn the call over to the operator and start the Q&A session.

Our first question comes from the line of Fei Fang from Goldman Sachs.
Please ask a question.
"
3666,LI,2022,1,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Thank you, Xue Deng.
This is Johnny Tie Li.
I will take the first question is the other gains, the increase of other gains compared with last quarter was mainly the VAT refund upon collection as well as our company was qualified as a software company.
"
3667,LI,2022,1,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,2,
3668,LI,2022,1,xue-deng,cicc,True,0,"[Foreign language] So my first question about -- the financial question about other income of RMB 280 million in the first quarter.
So where does it come from? And my second question is about the gasoline cost negotiation.
Therefore that many car companies said that they frequently negotiate the cost quarterly or half semiannually on.
So how about that? So if the price -- is the cost of battery yield continue to increase by the middle of this year.
How do we reflect and will be further with our selling track to reflect the cost of increase? And last question about the product pipeline.
And you can see that many brands they want to launch -- need to launch by few industries then the recent position -- price positioning of around RMB 200,000 this year, and the market has very high expectations for these totals.
How to review the market of outpace the significant submarket? And going to our plan, if we are going to launch again and with the price below RMB 300,000 I think that it should be not before 2024.
So I'll be worried about if the entry to the market today to meet these market opportunities.

3673,LI,2022,1,tim-hsiao,morgan-stanley,True,0,"[Foreign language] So I've got two questions.
The first question is about the sourcing strategy because we think the production recovery appear as a matter of time.
But has Li Auto taken any extra precautions, for example, reviewing or changing your current sourcing strategies in the wake of the recent disruption in Yangtze River Delta region.
As Kevin mentioned, 80% of our suppliers are currently located there.
So any thoughts on further diversification in China or offshore? Second question is about the potential price hike or margin pressure.
Because on top of the 11,800 price high of Li ONE since April, if there is any pressure on the further crisis adjustment or to spec inside of likely further price hike of key components, for example, like batteries into second half, especially production cost has substantially increased recently?

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
In the first quarter of 2022, the EV boom continued.
According to the China Passenger Car Association, or CPCA, retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles in China reached 1.07 million in the first quarter of 2022, representing a year-over-year increase of 146.6%.
And EV penetration rate climbed to a record high of 28.2% in March 2022.
As the leader in the new energy vehicle market, we are excited to be one of the driving forces behind the industry continued innovation and evolution.
Thanks to our Li ONE's outstanding feature and the compelling appeal to family users.
We delivered 31,716 Li ONE's during the quarter, aiming industrywide supply chain challenges, up 152.1% year over year and achieved a total revenue of RMB 9.56 billion, 167.5% higher than the first quarter of 2021.
The past seven months was undoubtedly a difficult period for all of us, given the headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have been no exception to the supply chain disruptions and rising material and logistics costs that challenged the entire auto industry.
Our Changzhou manufacturing base is located in center of the Yangtze Delta region, which is home to over 80% of our part suppliers, especially in the city of Shanghai and Kunshan.
The 2019 resurgence in this area since late March has incapacitated some suppliers in Shanghai and Kunshan.
Some of them completely shut down their production and delivery, making it impossible for us to maintain production after exhausting our parts inventory.
This materially affected our production in April, resulting in delayed deliveries to our customers.
As a result, we only completed 4,167 deliveries in April.
In light of the encouraging signs of the recovery from the pandemic in the Yangtze Delta region, we expect our total deliveries in the second quarter of this year to be between 21,000 to 24,000 vehicles.
We should note there are still uncertainties with respect to the pace of the recovery.
While we are doing everything in our power to increase our production and overcome supply chain constraints, aiming to shorten the delivery waiting time for Li ONE users while meeting all pandemic prevention and containment requirements from the government.
To help offset the sharply rising raw material costs, particularly the battery cost, we raised the price of Li ONE by RMB 11,800 effective April 1st this year.
Moving to the profitability.
In the first quarter, our gross margin remained robust at 22.6%.
Our R&D expenses increased 167% year over year to RMB 1.37 billion, accounting for over 14% of our total revenues, as we continue to enhance our strategic investment in autonomous driving, intelligence costed, and electrification.
The increase in R&D together with our direct sales and servicing network expansion resulted in a 151.5% increase in our operating expense year over year.
Despite the deliberate increase in expenses to drive growth, our net cash flow from operations was positive for the eighth consecutive quarter at RMB 1.83 billion, thanks to our outstanding manufacturing and operational efficiency.
In addition to propelling growth, our expanding direct sales and servicing network serves as an important and efficient interface for us to gain insight into our users' needs and desires.
We think like a user, this perspective informs and motivates us as we strive to continually, please users with updated features, product designs, and services.
As of April 30th, 2022, we have 225 retail stores covering 106 cities and the 292 servicing center, and the Li Auto authorized body and paint workshops operating in 211 cities.
Going forward, we will continue to grow our sales network and the cadence that accommodates both our objective to capture market demand and the risk related to the ongoing dynamic.
With respect to R&D, since we released our OTA 3.0 to introduce our full-stack NOA on December 1 last year and become the third automotive OEM globally to develop a full-stack sales development NOA, more than 100,000.
2021 Li ONE users have enjoyed NOA-assisted driving as of the end of April.
We are pleased to see our sales development process contribute to the consistent improvement in our NOA's safety and functionalities.
Its penetration rate has reached to 61.3%, which means that 61.3% of our users utilize NOA on the highways once it's available.
The data gathered from the NOA mileage in real-life driving scenarios will play a crucial role in our future ADAS development and facilitate our ultimate goal of full -- fully autonomous driving.
The NVIDIA Orin-X chipset and the LiDAR on our next full-size SUV, the L9 will further improve our vehicles autonomous driving capabilities.
Our R&D efforts to develop our range extension system, chassis and the domain controller in-house are also bearing fruits.
These R&D trends, among others, will be unveiled in our second production model, the L9.
That leads us to our update on products.
Our first model, Li ONE, has been a proven success catering to the needs of families in China.
After Li ONE emerged as one of the industry's best SUV choice for family users, we built on our strengths and are getting ready to launch our second production model, the L9.
Despite a few pandemic-related box in the road, we are forging ahead with our plan to commence the delivery of the L9 in the third quarter.
The L9 is a flagship SUV for family users based on our new generation EREV platform, offering best-in-class combination of performance, safety, and intelligence.
As just mentioned, it features our fully sales developed range extension system, chassis control system, and central vehicle domain controllers, which empower its outstanding dynamic performance and drivability.
In keeping with our fundamental belief that safety should always be standard, not optional.
Every L9 is built to our strictest safety standards and come equipped with our upgraded autonomous driving system, Li AD Max, capable of all-scenario NOA for enhanced driving safety and convenience.
The L9 also comes standard with first-class premium features such as sumptuous seats, a high-performance audio system, and all-new three-dimensional interactive experience.
Above all, the L9 aims to meet the needs of more family users and the delight users by proactively satisfying desire that they may never knew exist.
Since we released the teaser information for the vehicle, we have received a great deal of positive customer feedback.
And we can't wait to deliver our L9 and amaze our users with all its features and benefits.
In parallel with our EREV development, we are also investing in R&D for next-generation electric vehicle technology, including high C-rate battery, high-voltage platform, and ultra-fast charging technology, with the goal of building an end-to-end BEV and charging ecosystem that can support a driving range of more than 400 kilometers with only 10 minutes charging.
As a leader in the new energy vehicle industry, we are dedicated to leading the future of mobility, while also making a positive impact on the environment of our society.
On April 19th, we released our first ESG report, which marks yet another step forward in our sustainability journey and underscore our results to operate responsibly.
In addition, we are pleased to report that our Class A ordinary shares were included in the Shenzhen and Shanghai Hong Kong Stock Connect programs on March 14th and April 25th this year, respectively.
This allows us to access a broader investor base and share our growth trajectory and further success with users, partners, and investors in Mainland China, we are the financial market.
Looking forward, we will continue to create the right products for family users.
Preserving through challenges with our laser focus on operational and financial efficiency, propelling progress, and inspire happiness along the way.
With that, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Johnny for a closer look at our financial performance.
Please go ahead.

3676,LI,2022,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,1,"Thank you, Fang Fei.
This is Kevin.
Thank you for your question.
OK.
On your first question, in fact, the outlook we gave just now is based on our expectation of the recovery of the production of our suppliers in Yangtze Delta region.
Basically, you can see from end of April to now, although still a lot of suppliers are still struggling to recover, but we already see some of the positive signs that at least half of our suppliers already resumed their production.
So, therefore, for the -- there still are uncertainties for the next step.
And in terms of the order, we have enough order to on hand, yes.
So right now, the single biggest risk is still the production of our suppliers.
And in terms of the March market launch plan for L9, as we just mentioned in the third quarter of this year.
Yes, L9 will be delivered to our customers.
And overall -- I think for the overall EV business, behind us, we already see that in the past two quarters, we have already seen a very strong growth both the production and the consumption.
So looking to the future, I think there are uncertainties.
First of all, is the recovery of the supply chain.
On the other hand, if the pandemic persists for a longer time, our fear is that the consumers spending desire will reduce, yes.
So that's another thing we are monitoring closely.
On your second question, actually, we -- right now, it's not time for us to provide another updated guidance for our gross margin.
"
3677,LI,2022,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,2,"Thank you, Tim.
This is Kevin again.
So first of all, for the supply chain management.
In fact, we -- in the past, we already have the measurement to try to qualify more suppliers to supply us.
So that will not change.
And right now, of course, with the pandemic, we are -- we will definitely consider some short-term measurement to counter the impact because we will -- there are still uncertainties of the recovery of the dynamic in front of us.
For the long-term, I don't think we'll take any dramatic measurement to change our supply chain management strategy.
Because the dynamic is -- we think still is a onetime issue for us.
And the supply chain strategy is a long-term thing.
And for the price adjustment, in fact, with 2021 Li ONE, actually, when we increased the price on April 1st, we already took the -- took into consideration of all the foreseeable material cost increase, yes.
But we are -- but we will continue to closely monitor the volatility of the cost.
So right now, we're doing -- we don't see another need to further change our price, yes.
But that's based on the current information we have.
Operator
All right.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from [Inaudible] from HSBC.
Please go ahead.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] My two questions.
First is on the order book and the demand outlook.
What's the new order book momentum post the price hike? And how would the new order book in April compared to January? And looking ahead, how would management would expect high-end pricing category, EV demand in second half looks like more gross quota are back-end loaded.
And the second question is on the product cycle and product strategy.
We may see L9 coming through and next year would be a big product cycle launching yes.
Will we have your insight on how we plan the five models, five new models value proposition in the coming 18 months and the conviction or the product philosophy to enable them or potentially the segment winner?
"
3678,LI,2022,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,3,"Thank you, [Inaudible].
This is Kevin.
I will take the first question and leave the second question to Li Xiang.
As we all know that the -- in April 1st, we increased our price.
Naturally, the -- a lot of sales leads were consumed in the end of March, yes.
So therefore, in the very beginning of April because we have to restart the sales leads our pipeline.
So, therefore, the first half of April was a little bit slow.
But since the last week of April and also the -- also the first week of May, we already see a very strong comeback of the order intake.
The only exception is like Shanghai because the pandemic stopped us from taking orders.
So overall, we are still very confident that the -- how Li ONE will continue to be demand will continue to be very strong.
Overall, for the high-end EV market.
Overall, unless the dynamic persist very long time and hurt the economy very badly.
Otherwise, we think the demand will continue to be stable, yes.
And -- but from our side, because our Li ONE and also our incoming L9, the product competitiveness is very, very strong.
So therefore, despite the demand side fluctuation, we still have a very strong confidence that these two products will do very good this year in market.
"
3679,LI,2022,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,4,"Yes, Lee.
This is Kevin.
Thank you for the question.
Three questions.
First of all, we think right now the battery cost, especially the raw material cost is already deviated from the reasonable price of course.
So with the supply increase, we'll definitely see gradually the raw material cost should go down, yes.
But overall for this year, we still expect the -- probably the price will still stay in a relatively high position.
That's our outlook, yes.
So of course, this high price of the raw material we will translate into the increase of the end consumer price Therefore, we will kind of hurt the market demand.
But as I mentioned just now, with our Li ONE and our L9 because our product competitiveness is very high.
We still have strong confidence that even with a slightly higher price, we can still get a lot of order.
For example, for Li ONE even though we increased the price starting from April 1st.
But as I've just mentioned, starting from end of April until now, we see the orders still are coming strong, yes.
And in terms of the retail stores, we did have a quite aggressive plan by end of this year, we want to have more than 400 retail stores.
Right now, of course, because of this pandemic issue, we are revisiting our plan.
But we should all agree that the number of retail stores will -- is a fundamental requirement for us to achieve a higher sales volume next year.
So, therefore, it doesn't matter how big the impact the pandemic for this year.
We still want to open as many retail stores as possible despite the impact of the dynamic.
In terms of charging poles starting from this year, we already have a team starting to build the charging poles.
Right now, the initial focus of this team is to primarily build charging poles along the highway, especially those highways connecting the big cities, yes.
So right now, the primary focus is still the highway to connect the cities.
And within the city, depends on the customer needs, yes, we will very -- we will choose carefully whether we want to build charging poles within city, yes.
That's the strategy right now we have, yes.
Operator
All right.
Thank you.
Next question comes from Xue Deng from CICC.
Please ask your question.
"
3680,LI,2022,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,5,"This is Kevin.
For the battery cost, we agreed with our suppliers with a framework to kind of relate the battery price with the fluctuation of the upstream raw materials.
So, therefore, for the coming quarters, we don't need to renegotiate everything.
But of course, we'll always come back to our suppliers as for cost savings.
That's for sure, yes.
And also, as I just mentioned, the price increase already reflected our expectation of the -- for the raw material price in the coming quarters, yes.
"
3681,LI,2022,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,6,"Yes, Wang.
Thank you for the question.
It's a rather complicated question.
So basically, the first quarter is financial performance already to consideration of the, of course, already to consideration of part of the battery cost increase.
And the impact was not that dramatic primarily due to, as you know, that we have inventories.
So, therefore, the cost, in fact, it's a rolling mix, yes.
So that's for the first quarter.
From second quarter, we'll have the best free cost increase, as you mentioned.
And at the same time, from the beginning of this quarter, we'll have a selling price increase.
So yes, so, therefore, it's not that we can expect some very high gross margin compared to last quarter, yes.
OK.
Operator
All right.
Thank you.
As we are reaching the end of our conference call, I would like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks.
Ms.
Janet Chang.
Please go ahead.
"
3682,LI,2022,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,7,
3683,LI,2022,1,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"[Foreign language] This is Li Xiang.
I'm translating for Li Xiang, the founder of the company.
When we launched our first product by the end of 2019, it was one single product, which became a big success.
But from that time on, we started to look at our product portfolio as a combination of different products.
And therefore, since then, we started developing five different platforms to support our product portfolio, including the range extended platform, 800 high-voltage electric vehicle platform, the autonomous driving platform, smart space platform, and our electric e-architecture platform.
So all these fly platforms combined together support our wide range of products across different price ranges.
So by 2021, if you look at Li ONE as a product, in the RMB 300,000 to RMB 400,000 in EV market and already had a 30% market share and it's still increasing.
And that's our standard for a successful hit product, and we think that's a very comparable market share in the target market.
And with that in mind, we want to continue to deliver hit products in every price range within our target markets.
And we look at our product portfolio with two perspectives.
The first one is that we pair a different body type with different energy sources.
And by that, I mean, electric -- pure electric vehicles will have one body type and extended range vehicles would have a different body type.
So when we built -- started building range-extended vehicles, we felt -- we realized that the best body type was SUVs because neither sedans or MPVs were a good fit from a packaging standpoint for range-extended vehicles.
And by the same logic, when it comes to electric vehicles, we realize that big SUVs are no longer a good fit because for energy efficiency reasons.
And therefore, when we deliver our first electric vehicle, you will see a completely new body type that we believe is best optimized for electric -- pure electric vehicles.
And with this combination, we believe there will be no cannibalization between our own electric vehicle and range-extended vehicle product portfolios.
And with those, we will completely cover the RMB 200,000, RMB 500,000 target market.
So that was our first strategy.
And the second strategy is with respect to the price range.
So with the goal of covering the entire RMB 200,000 to RMB 500,000 price range, in every 10,000 -- 100,000 segment we will have one hit product, one in range extended and one in pure electric.
We had a good start because our first product was in the RMB 300,000 price range.
So from there, we can go up to RMB 400,000 to RMB 500,000, and we can also go down to between RMB 200,000 and RMB 300,000.
So in every segment, as I said earlier, there will be one EV and one REV and they will all be built based on those five platforms I mentioned earlier, the range-extended vehicle platform, the high-voltage electric vehicle platform, autonomous driving platform, smart space platform, and e-architecture platform.
So by analogy, you can see our product portfolio is very similar to iPhone, where -- we have one key concept and platform.
And from there on, it covers all different price ranges with the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Promax, and even the iPhone Mini.
And in every price range, you can see the product is an absolute leader in that market segment.
And that has been our role in -- our goal and philosophy since three years ago.
Operator
All right.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee from Bank of America.
Please ask a question.
"
3684,LI,2022,1,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"[Foreign language] It's very clear to us that by 2025, our core customers will still be families with kids.
And with that, three things become very clear.
First is that we're always going to build vehicles with an acceptable level of interior dimensions for family users.
And the second one is that all of our vehicles will be all-wheel drive.
And third is that we want to make sure that every vehicle includes our latest autonomous driving and smart space solutions so that every family member are able to enjoy them.
And with these three things in mind, it's very natural that we will continue to focus on the RMB 200,000 to RMB 500,000 price range.
And within this range, we'll continue the mine of $300,000, $400,000, which is our starting point.
And from there on, we'll expand upward to the full-size market and downwards the midsize market.
So this year, as you know, our focus will be the L9 release.
And next year, we'll be launching three new vehicles, including a new -- completely new range-extended vehicle and also our first battery-electric vehicle.
And you will also see our first product in the first -- in the 200,000 to 300,000 midsized market.

First, about the business outlook was the broader market level assumptions that management are working with in terms of both supply and demand.
What's the specific launch timing for L9? How will production ramp up? Any comment on the broader market environment would be very helpful.
Second is about margin.
The first quarter margin was a beat.

3689,LI,2022,1,ming-hsun-lee,bank-of-america-merrill-lynch,True,0,"[Foreign language] So my first question is for the battery price and also the leasing supply.
In the future, where you think the leasing supply will constrain the EV growth for China.
And also currently, the battery price is still high.
Do you think this is because of some speculative trading? Or it's really mainly because of real demand? Second question regarding your point of sales expansion, previously, your target is 400 stores by the end of the year.
But under the pandemic, where you slowed down the progress? And also in terms of the charging pile, do you have any plan are all of your charging station based the supercharging infrastructure? Thank you.

3691,LI,2022,4,bin-wang,credit-suisse,True,0,"[Foreign language] Actually, got two questions.
Number one is about a second order.
For your guidance, you said that before L7, L8 version you got 25,000 units sales.
But after that, you got 30,000 units, which means will be fighting from L7 Air.
So, can I think that overall L7 will be bigger than the total order flow from L8 and L9? That's the first question about the order flow for L7.
And the second question about our margin.
I actually try to quantify the margin impact in the number four quarter because we see a few factors number-wise that -- and these impacts actually increasing quite back in the number four quarter compared to number three, increasing from 400,000 units maybe [Inaudible] to more 500,000 [Inaudible].
Is that going to be the number one reason? Number two is about the promotion for the Li ONE.
We saw that in the last quarter last year.
Each month, we sell around 1,000 units and Li ONE.
So, is that going to create an inventory second week while the margin did not increase? And third one is about the component supply normally for car maker in the first certain months say, 30K.
You actually have a higher cost.
After 50K, you have lower cost.
So, what's the reason? I'm trying to understand what's the margin trend of first quarter next year, 2023? Thank you.

Hello, everyone.
I will now review some of our 2022 fourth-quarter financials.
To leave more time for the Q&A session, I will drive financial highlights here and encourage you to refer to our earnings press release for more details.
Our total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 were RMB 17.65 billion, or $2.56 billion, representing an increase of 66.2% year over year and an increase of 88.9% quarter over quarter.
This included RMB 17.27 billion, or $2.5 billion, from vehicle sales, which was up 66.4% year over year and 90.9% quarter over quarter.
The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in vehicle delivery, as well as higher average selling price due to our delivery of Li L9, starting in late August, and Li L8, starting in November.
Revenues from other sales and revenues were RMB 381.5 million, or $55.3 million, in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 55.9% year over year and an increase of 28.7% quarter over quarter.
The increase was mainly due to the increased sales of accessory and services in line with higher accumulated vehicle sales.
Our cost of sales in the fourth quarter was RMB 14.08 billion, or $2.04 billion, representing an increase of 70.9% year over year, an increase of 72.6% quarter over quarter.
Our gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB 3.57 billion, or $517.1 million, growing 49.8% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and 201.7% compared with the third quarter of this year -- of 2022.
Vehicle margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 20%, compared with 22.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 12% in the third quarter of 2022.
The decrease in vehicle margin over the fourth quarter of 2021 was mainly due to the different product mix between the two quarters.
The increase in vehicle margin over the third quarter was mainly attributable to the losses on purchase commitments related to Li ONE in the third quarter of 2022.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 20.2%, compared with 22.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 12.7% in the third quarter of 2022.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were RMB 3.7 billion, or $536.4 million, representing an increase of 47.1% year over year and an increase of 11.7% quarter over quarter.
R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were RMB 2.07 billion, or $300.1 million, up 68.3% year over year and 14.7% quarter over quarter.
The increase was primarily driven by increased expenses to support our expanding product portfolios, as well as increased employee compensation as a result of our growing number of staff.
Our selling, general, and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were RMB 1.63 billion, or $236.3 million, representing an increase of 44.8% year over year, an increase of 8.1% quarter over quarter.
The increase was primarily driven by increased employee compensation as a result of our growing number of staff, as well as increased rental expenses associated with the expansion of our sales and servicing network.
Loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB 133.6 million, or $19.4 million, compared with RMB 24.1 million net income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 and representing a decrease of 97 -- 93.7% from RMB 2.13 billion loss from operations in the third quarter of 2022.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB 265.3 million, or $38.5 million, reflecting a decrease of 10.2% from RMB 295.5 million net income for the same period in 2021 and compared with RMB 1.65 billion net loss in the third quarter of 2022.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposit, and short-term investment were RMB 58.45 billion, or $8.47 billion, as of December 31st, 2022.
Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB 4.93 billion, or $714.1 million.
Free cash flow was RMB 3.26 billion, or $472.3 million, in the fourth quarter of 2022.
As of December 31st, 2022, we had a total of 19,396 employees.
For more of our 2022 full-year financials, please refer to our earnings press release for more details.
And now, for our business outlook.
For the first quarter of 2023, the company expects the deliveries to be between 52,000 and 55,000 vehicles, representing an increase of 64% to 73.4% from the first quarter of 2022.
The company also expects first-quarter total revenues to be between RMB 17.45 billion and RMB 18.45 billion, or $2.53 billion and $2.8 billion, representing an increase of 82.5% to 93% from the first quarter of 2022.
This business outlook assumes supportive macroeconomic conditions, no significant disruption in the supply chain, and reflects the company's current and preliminary view on its business situation and market conditions, which is subject to change.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to start our Q&A session.

Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] The first question today comes from Tim Hsiao with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
"
3695,LI,2022,4,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Thank you, Paul.
This is Johnny from the company.
First, the gross margin is healthy and consistent with our guidance.
And starting from the fourth quarter, our revenue and gross margin and gross profit is a mix of different product offering.
And the majority of the sales volume comes from the L9 and the L8, and both products is under the ramping-up period.
As you know, our supply chain needs to ramp up with some period and to release the gross margin -- the cost down in coming quarters.
And our L Series platform, the overall gross margin is 25% with material delivery in the future.
Market delivery.
Thank you.
"
3696,LI,2022,4,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"[Foreign language] I will take both your questions.
First, I think for the new L7.
At Li Auto, we still need some time to ramp up.
For the Q1 guidance, we include several thousand L7s.
Most of the delivery will be still be L9 and L8.
And as we mentioned, April or May will be -- the whole month, we deliver our L Series, including Air.
So, we have some of our order.
But as you know, the Air versions test drive hasn't start.
So, a lot of the customers need to do test drive.
So, the mix just like those [Inaudible] you can see from [Inaudible].
And for the second question, I think all the factors you mentioned is a -- was the factor that makes our 20% gross margin in the fourth quarter.
And all this, as a whole, cut the impact about 2% of the margin.
So, I think I don't want to break it into too much detail.
And for this year, considering the market conditions, we still want to keep our guidance to be above 20%.
Thank you.
"
3697,LI,2022,4,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,3,"For the gross margin, as we just mentioned, for L Series platform, with all this product offering and with some scalability, the design gross profit is -- profit margin is 35%.
Considering this year's battery price and also the macroeconomics, we still want to keep our presence just about 20%.

3699,LI,2022,4,paul-gong,ubs,True,0,"[Foreign language] So, my first question is regarding the gross margin.
I think for this quarter, the vehicle gross margin has been 20%, which is about 1 percentage point lower than second quarter and 2 percentage points lower than first quarter.
I think just now, Mr.
Li Xiang has mentioned it was due to the product mix change.
But my understanding is L9 contributed about 60% of the volume for this quarter, which should be positive for the margin.
Is that due to the initial ramping up stage? Or is there any other reasons you can share? This is my first question.
"
3700,LI,2022,4,paul-gong,ubs,True,1,"[Foreign language] So, my second question is regarding to your upcoming pure electric, perhaps among MPV.
I understand the selling point might be fast charging, but we also see some competitors, some peers' fast-charging BEV models recently launched, didn't really met the expectation.
So, how should we define our products by maintaining the competitiveness while trying to achieve gross margins is hopefully are comparable to our existing EREV products?

3703,LI,2022,4,tim-hsiao,morgan-stanley,True,0,"[Foreign language] So, my first question is about the [Inaudible] outlook.
We noticed that, previously, the management shared the monthly deliveries could, at least, reach 25,000 after the delivery of L7 started with a further point to 30,000 after the Air versions of L7, 8 are available.
So, I just want to double confirm that how we come up with such as strong target? Are they based on the pace of the new order and tech order backlog or our assessment of total addressable market of five- six-seater SUV? And how fast could Li Auto's smart fleet deliveries reach and stabilize at such level? And more importantly, could the supply chain coordinately ramp up their output at such a rapid pace? [Foreign language]
"
3704,LI,2022,4,tim-hsiao,morgan-stanley,True,1,"[Foreign language] So, my second question is about battery procurement costs and the potential impact to your margin.
We so strong likely see that battery prices would continue a downtrend this year.
And previously, local media also reported, like [Inaudible] and likely others are rallying to offer some aggressive pricing in exchange for long-term contracts from Li Auto and other top-notch EV makers.
So, could the management team comment on potential collaboration with battery makers? And how should we think about the contribution to Li Auto's vehicle margin improvement in the following quarters in terms of scale and timing versus current level?
"
3705,LI,2022,4,tim-hsiao,morgan-stanley,True,2,"[Foreign language] Thank you very much for the detailed update.

3707,LI,2022,4,yuqian-ding,hsbc,True,0,"[Foreign language] I only got one question.
Is that -- within our current three SUV model portfolio, how do we evaluate the potential cannibalization given by different version of different models, the pricing points overlap? And should these three models combined sales between amount 20K to 30K, what's the roughly margin range we would expect given these three SUV models have the shared cost base?

3709,LI,2022,4,xiang-li,"founder,-chairman,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,0,"[Foreign language] Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
2022 was another year of explosive growth for new energy vehicles in China as more consumers embrace NEVs.
According to the China Passenger Car Association, the penetration rate of new energy passenger vehicles reached 31.7% in Q4 2022, compared to 14.8% in 2021 and 29% in Q3 2022.
Our business continued to grow rapidly.
In less than a year, we launched three new models, L9, L8, and L7, fully covering the family SUV market between RMB 300,000 and RMB 500,000.
These launches further solidified our market leadership.
In the meantime, we continue to fortify our foundations across R&D, supply chain, and sales and service networks.
We've upgraded our overall business processes and org structure to prepare for ourselves in the one-to-ten stage.
Next, moving on to deliveries and recent updates.
In December 2022, we delivered more than 20,000 vehicles, setting another record not only for ourselves but also all emerging automakers in China, putting us in a very good position for 2023.
While Li L9 has been dominating the full-size SUV monthly sales chart in China ever since its release in December -- sorry, in September, Li L8 continued Li ONE's sales success, becoming the top seller of all large SUVs in December 2022.
We delivered 46,319 new vehicles in Q4 2022, and 2022 annual deliveries reached 133,246 units.
In December 2022, according to the insurance registration data from Chinese Automotive Technology Research Center, we ranked first in both the SUV and NEV markets in the price range of 300,000 RMB to 500,000 RMB ,establishing ourselves as one of the go-to brands for all-premium SUV shoppers.
Furthermore, in the first quarter, a typical off-season for vehicle sales, we maintained strong order intake, showcasing the competitiveness of our products and services.
I would like to hereby thank all of our users and their families for their trust and support along the way.
Our revenues reached RMB 17.65 billion in Q4 and RMB 45.29 billion for the full-year 2022, up 66.2% and 67.7% year on year, respectively.
With our cost management capability and operational efficiency, we maintained a healthy gross margin of 20.2% and free cash flow of 3.26 billion RMB in Q4 2022.
Moving on to our product lineup.
On February 8, we officially launched the L7, our 5C flagship family SUV with test drives starting the day after.
Li L7 features exceptional second-row space, a comfortable interior, and a long list of standard features.
Equipped with our in-house developed all-wheel drive range extension system, the L7 has a CLTC range of 1,315 kilometers and zero to 100 kilometers per hour acceleration in 5.3 seconds.
L7 is developed with a G rating, the highest possible rating in the C-IASI 25% small overlap crash test for both the driver and passenger sides.
It also features the constantly evolved smart space infotainment system and our driver assistance system.
Li L7 is available in three trim levels, Air, Pro, and Max, fully covering the 300,000 RMB to 400,000 RMB price range.
Alongside the L7 release, we also released an Air model to our L8 lineup, which succeeded Li ONE in the same segment, which covers the 300,000 RMB to 350,000 RMB price range.
We will commence deliveries of Li L7 Pro and Max in early March, and delivery of Li L7 Air and L8 Air will start in early April this year.
With the introductions of these new models, we have completed the deployment of L7, L8, and L9 for the entire 300,000 RMB to 500,000 RMB SUV market.
The L7 also allowed us to reach a broader audience base.
The L7 not only received raving reviews from customer test drives but also brought in more diverse family users into our stores, which further led to new leads and orders for the L8.
On December 16th, the L9 was awarded the Car of the Year in the 10th Xuanyuan Award.
It is organized by the Auto Business Review and Austria-based EFS Consulting.
The Xuanyuan Award is widely regarded as the Academy award in the Chinese auto industry.
With Li L8 and L9 continued strong performance and the addition of L7 to our family, we will set ourselves a stretch goal of 20% market share in the 300,000 RMB to 500,000 RMB premium SUV segment this year.
Against this backdrop, we expect first-quarter deliveries to be in the range of 52,000 to 55,000 units.
Next, on to supply chain.
Despite continued supply chain challenges, our deliveries for both L9 and L8 exceeded 10,000 units in the first full month of delivery.
This was only possible with the support of our suppliers, and this was also a testament to our solid supply chain management capabilities.
We remain confident of our parts supply in 2023 as we further improve our planning, risk management, and cost management capabilities to cope with potential challenges and risks.
We take a modularized approach to supply chain management.
While we work closely with our supplier base, we have also strategically identified core area for in-house development and vertical integration in order to strike a good balance between cost and risk.
Over the past three years, we have been deploying a series of manufacturing facilities and the range extender in electric drive units.
Next, moving on to the sales network.
In Q4 2022, we continued to strengthen our direct sales and services network and to increase our user outreach and brand awareness in order to bolster our commercial capabilities and drive growth.
As of January 31st, 2023, we operated 296 retail stores, covering 123 cities, as well as 320 service centers and Li Auto authorized body shops in 222 cities.
In 2022, we expand -- while expanding our sales network, we focused on upgrading our existing retail stores to house multiple models in order to reach more different types of families.
In the coming quarters, as our brand continues to gain momentum, we have more multifunction stores -- we will have more multifunction stores in our sales network.
After more than three years of operation, the direct sales model has proven to provide better user experience and at a lower cost, which will remain our long-term commitment as the premium car brand.
In 2022, our SG&A expenses were already lower than our R&D expenses, and we expect to further reduce our selling expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2023.
In terms of R&D, it has always been a cornerstone of our value creation process for family users.
Excellent user research and development capabilities have not only allowed us to stand out in the NEV market but also will ultimately allow us to emerge as a world-class tech company.
In 2022, we made great strides in research and development.
On the electric drive unit, our L-series vehicles are powered by our in-house all-new range extension 2.0 system with our 1.5-liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine, boasting a maximum thermal efficiency of 40.5% and coupled with our proprietary five-in-one drive unit has significantly enhanced their overall noise vibration harshness performance.
Supported by our proprietary hardware and software, the Li Magic Carpet air suspension provides top-notch ride and handling, and, in particular, our own XCU vehicle controller is capable of handling complex vehicle information at high speed, enabling millisecond-grade vehicle control.
Our smart space continues to evolve.
Li Xiang Tong Xue, for instance, has evolved with a new generation device-cloud integrated architecture and has been rolled out to all of our L Series model.
Featuring our in-house inference engine for in-car scenario, LisaRT, provides solid foundation for the in-car deployment of more powerful and complex algorithms.
Moreover, we have made remarkable progress in the voice and vision-based interaction algorithms.
On the speech side, with our innovative MIMO-NET algorithm that can accurately isolate different human voices in multiple zones, with our voice recognition algorithm, MSE-NET, Li Xiang Tong Xue's activation and recognition accuracy both reached 98% in real-world testing.
These rates remain at over 90% in various demanding scenarios, including high noise, low voices, and children's voice.
On the vision side, our MVS-NET net algorithm can accurately recognize gestures of all occupants, combined with innovative [Inaudible] gesture technology and makes interactions through gestures easier and more natural, allowing a whole family to enjoy the superpower of making contact and taking control over the air.
In terms of autonomous driving, we adopted the fusion BEV algorithm framework jointly proposed by Tsinghua University, MIT, and us, which can be flexibly deployed with the Li AD Max and Li AD Pro's different hardware configuration.
Our in-house highway NOA prediction algorithm enables organic automated lane change and a smooth acceleration and deceleration experience.
As of now, over 220,000 family users have used our highway NOA features, covering 100 million kilometers of distance.
During the 2023 Chinese New Year holiday alone, our highway NOA mileage of all models reached almost 8 million kilometers.
This year, we'll further expand our NOA features into urban driving scenarios with beta testing for early bird users planning on the Li AD Max in the first quarter of this year.
In addition, we created the industry's first AEB function with LiDAR applications on Li AD Max and extended the LiDAR's algorithm safety scenarios for major traffic participants, such as vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, to cover irregular scenarios, including special vehicles, as well as night driving scenes.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing our core EREV and BEV technologies in-house and further elevating our product level intelligence.
To that end, we will consistently direct our R&D resources across products, platforms and systems to fuel our long-term growth.
In summary, we view our long-term success as a function of our continued investment in R&D and our business capabilities, which will support the creation of more hit model, enhance our brand value, and serve as critical pillars of our business flywheel.
2023 will be another year of rapid development of the NEV industry and for Li Auto in particular.
We have full confidence that we will be able to build an increasingly innovative and diverse model lineup and deliver outstanding products and services that will continue to exceed our users' needs.
With that, I will turn over the call to CFO -- our CFO, Johnny, for a deep dive into our financial performance.
"
3710,LI,2022,4,xiang-li,"founder,-chairman,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,1,"[Foreign language] So, 25,000 to 30,000 orders is our internal goal.
And we expect to reach this level in Q2.
This is -- April is the first full month where we deliver the L7 Pro and Max.
And May will be the first month where we deliver the Air version of L7 and L8.
[Foreign language] Second question about our ramp-up.
Admittedly, we experienced some issues in the second half of 2022 with our deliveries.
And we attributed really to two things.
One is because we had set a very aggressive delivery goal because we were seeing really good order intake.
So, that placed a lot of pressure on the supply chain.
And the second cause was we were switching from a single model to multiple models, which again, placed a lot of pressure on our sales and service networks.
So, across Q4 and Q1 of this year, we have been going through a long process of upgrading our sales and service and manufacturing systems so that, now, we have a very robust system all the way from planning to delivery, to manufacturing and sales so that we can handle really the stress that comes in with our strong order intake.
And that really helps us to make three things a lot better.
The first one is resource allocation.
We could really allocate the best resource to where it's most needed.
And the second one is our employees will feel more fulfilled as they achieve these goals.
And third is that it also applied suppliers to reach higher efficiency on their side.
"
3711,LI,2022,4,xiang-li,"founder,-chairman,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,2,"[Foreign language] So, in terms of battery pricing, there are many factors at play, including the Li [Inaudible] and battery pricing mechanisms.
But in general, our belief is that as battery costs continues to approach a more reasonable level, we think it's good for the industry, not only for us as OEMs but also for suppliers and battery manufacturers.
[Foreign language] So, as we expand to more models and as our sales continue to ramp up, we believe battery is a very strategic asset, and we will continue to commit to a multisupplier strategy for two reasons.
One is for -- not only for the stability of our supply chain but also to meet the time requirements for developing multiple models at the same time.
[Foreign language] Now, in the long term, we believe that battery prices will continue to move toward a more reasonable level.
As you can see in the past few days, the price of lithium carbonate has already reached 400,000 RMB per ton.
And we believe the long-term trend is still for the price to go down, and we'll continue to work with suppliers to negotiate a good term.
But there's not much details I can share at this point.
"
3712,LI,2022,4,xiang-li,"founder,-chairman,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,3,"[Foreign language] So, I'll answer this question on three levels.
So, I'll start off with why we decided to build EREVs in the first place.
It was really two things, right? One is because battery costs are very high.
And second was charging was difficult at that time for electric vehicles.
It was not only difficult to find charging stations but also very slow to charge.
So, moving over to EVs.
We also intend to solve the three issues.
The first one is about charging.
With EREVs, our strategy has been to use gas on highways and use electricity in the local environment.
So, EV, we saw the same issue by charging rapidly, charging 400 kilometers of range in 10 minutes, which is very comparable to gas cars.
But that's not the complete picture.
It's like when we had 4G mobile phones, if we don't only have 2G networks, it still wouldn't work.
So, another piece of the puzzle is infrastructure.
So, with carbide charging capabilities and infrastructure, we are able to provide a level of charging experience comparable to EREVs or gas vehicles.
And second one is cost.
As you can see, we've invested a lot on our 800-volt high-voltage architecture, as well as our own in-house silicon carbide factory.
And many of these innovations combined allow us to significantly increase the efficiency of our EV architecture.
Compared to 400-volt IGBT systems, we observed almost 15% of energy efficiency compared to similar models of 400-volt architecture.
And that saves a significant amount of battery and therefore, cost of the vehicle.
And the third level I want to talk about is product.
We -- I can assure you that on our EV product lineup, we'll be able to provide a similar level of product and experience differentiation that significantly exceed our user expectations, even more so than our EV models.
"
3713,LI,2022,4,xiang-li,"founder,-chairman,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,4,"[Foreign language] In terms of orders, in Shanghai, the general order flow was not very good.
And that was understandable because most of the demand was released in November and December last year.
But we have seen a very significant recovery since February.
And over the long term, we look at this issue from a market share standpoint.
And we believe the steady state market share in Shanghai will be comparable to that in Beijing because, going forward, immediately, these markets, our EV purchase will be incentivized by free license plates.
So, we think Shanghai will eventually move toward a market share similar to that in Beijing.
[Foreign language] First of all, in terms of flagship EV product, the timing of the product release is highly tied to the cycle of technology innovations.
And in particular, in this case, at the end of this year, there will be a big milestone where Qualcomm will be releasing their 8295 chips.
So, the delay in our EV product is highly tied to this because we want to meet the development cycle so that we can release our flagship vehicle with the new chip as early as possible.
We cannot have our flagship model and only carry the last generation chip when it comes to market.
And the second one, in terms of the EV lineup, the EV lineup will basically mirror something similar to what we have with the L Series, which fully covers the 200,000 RMB to 500,000 RMB price range.
"
3714,LI,2022,4,xiang-li,"founder,-chairman,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,5,"[Foreign language] First one, about the 300,000-500,000 price range.
We were at a market share of 9.5% last year, as you mentioned.
And this year, we expect the whole market size to be between 1.4 million to 1.5 million units.
And our goal is to double the share because we believe at 20% share is where we could reasonably steadily stay as the brand champion.
And that's kind of how our goal came about.
The 200,000 to 300,000 market is a lot more competitive.
So, our plan is to achieve the market -- approach the market at a second stage where we have much greater economy of scale and stronger core competencies.
"
3715,LI,2022,4,xiang-li,"founder,-chairman,-and-chief-executive-officer",False,6,"[Foreign language] In fact, in practice, we've seen very clear user base differentiation between L7 and L9 -- L8.
There hasn't been as much overlap as we have been expecting.
As we've seen in showrooms, the L7 is really attracting families with two to three members, one kid.
And L8 is attracting either families with two kids or those that are three generations under the same roof.
And another good thing is that the interest in L7 has also helped a few orders for L8.
So, with L8, L7, and L9, we really formed -- it's not just a product line but, in fact, the product network.
We want any family who is willing to buy an SUV will come to our network and find -- and think about whether it's L7 or L8 or L8 or L9 that they should buy rather than comparing us to other brands and pick which brand to buy.
That has been our core product philosophy with the product lineup of L7, L8, and L9.

3717,LI,2022,4,yan-xie,chief-technology-officer,False,0,"Hello, Yingbo.
This is Yan.
Let me take your question.
We have invested in the development of AI-based cognitive technologies for quite a long time, especially the conversational AI and the gesture recognition.
We think they are very important in smart space, and we give our customers very good user experience.
So, recently, we are paying close attention to ChatGPT, and we think it's technology -- the technology behind like large language models and pretrained models are very similar to what we are doing right now in smart space.
So, we also believe that these technologies have good potentials in visual tasks like self-driving.

And consumers expect we will have a brand-new BEV platform model in the market, and a more complex, complicated [Inaudible] and a multichannel network layout.

Any add to the family car market segment? How can you keep [Inaudible] product differentiation in your different models, such as SUV or MPV, and also different number of the seats? What can be looking forward to get greater differentiation?
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Our philosophy is the same as before.
We still believe that price and seat configuration is the best way to segment the market.
And this has been partly tested by the success of L9 and 8 and 7, which is soon to start delivery, in that these three cars actually have attracted three very different user groups.
If you look at L9, it's pretty much attractive to premium car buyers at the same price point or even higher than the current price level of L9.
And L8 pretty perfectly replaced Li ONE and has shared a very similar customer base as Li ONE.
And L7 has been attracting a lot of young family users aged between 25 and 35.
So, as you can see, pricing and seat arrangements have allowed us to very efficiently cover the market and different user groups.
And there have even been some surprises, in the case of L7, where we've been able to tap into new age groups that we hadn't -- we weren't expecting before.

3733,LI,2022,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thank you, Kevin.
Hello, everyone.
I will now go over some of our financial results for the third quarter of 2022.
Being mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage you to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenue -- revenue in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB 9.34 billion, or USD 1.31 billion, representing a increase of 20.2%, from RMB 7.78 billion in the third quarter of 2021.
This included RMB 9.05 billion, USD or 1.27 billion, of vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2022, up 22.5% year over year and 6.6% quarter over quarter.
This increase was mainly due to our delivery of Li L9 starting in late August, which raised our average selling price in the third quarter of 2022.
Revenues from other sales and services were RMB 296.4 million, or USD 41.7 million, in the third quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 23.9% from the same period last year and an increase of 19% from the second quarter of this year.
The year-over-year decrease was attributable to the sales of automotive by regulatory credits in the third quarter of 2021, which didn't recur in the third quarter of 2022.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue from other sales and services was mainly due to the increased sales of accessories and the services in line with higher accumulated vehicle sales.
Cost of sales in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB 8.16 billion, or USD 1.15 billion, representing a increase of 36.8% year over year and the increase of 19.1% quarter over quarter.
The increase in cost of sales was mainly driven by higher average cost of sales due to our delivery of Li L9 starting in late August and a provision related to Li ONEs as we lower its order forecast considering the stronger-than-expected market demands for Li L9 and our accelerated launch of Li L8.
The provision in the amount of RMB 802.8 million, or USD 112.9 million, was made based on our updated order forecast for Li ONE after the launch of Li L9 and Li L8.
Gross profit in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB 1.18 billion, or USD 166.2 million, decreasing 34.8% year over year and 37.1% quarter over quarter.
Vehicle margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 12%, compared with 21.1% in the third quarter of 2021 and 21.2% in the second quarter of this year, mostly due to the provisions related to Li ONE I just mentioned.
Excluding this impact, the vehicle marking was 20.8% in the third quarter of 2002.
Going forward, with our production ramp-up and responsible cost management, we expect to realize greater economy of scale and to drive costs down further, putting us back on track to hit our profitability inflection point.
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 12.7%, compared to 23.3% in the third quarter of last year and 21.5% in the second quarter of this year.
Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB 3.31 billion, or USD 465.6 million, increasing 73.4% year over year and 15.9% quarter over quarter.
R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB 1.8 billion, or USD 253.6 million, up 103.1% year over year and 17.8% quarter over quarter.
The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased expenses associated with future models, as well as increased employee compensation as a result of our growing number of R&D staff.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by increased expenses associated with future models.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB 1.51 billion, or USD 211.9 million, up 47.6% year over year and 13.8 quarter over quarter.
The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased employee compensation as a result of growth of the growth in our staff, as well as increase in rental expenses associated with the expansion of the company's sales network.
This quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by increased marketing and promotion activities and increased employee compensation as a result of the growth in our staff [Inaudible].
Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2022, was RMB 2.13 billion, or USD 299.4 million, compared to a loss of RMB 97.8 million in the same period last year and a loss of RMB 976.5 million in the second quarter of this year.
Net loss was RMB 1.65 billion, or USD 231.3 million, in the third quarter of 2022, comparable with RMB 21.5 million in the third quarter of last year and RMB 641 million in the second quarter of 2022.
And now, turning to our balance sheet and the cash flow.
Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits, short-term investments, long-term time deposits and long-term financial instruments that were included in long-term investments total RMB 55.83 billion, or USD 7.85 billion, as of September 30th, 2022.
Net cash used in operating activities in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB 508.3 million, or USD 71.5 million.
The change in net cash used in operating activities over both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year was mainly due to the increased impairment related to inventory purchase, partially offset by the increase in cash received from the customer.
Free cash flow was negative RMB 1.96 billion, or negative USD 275.3 million, in the third quarter of 2022.
And now, for our business outlook.
For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company expects deliveries to be between 45,000 and 48,000 vehicles, representing a increase of 27.8% to 36.3% from the fourth quarter of last year.
The company also expects fourth quarter total revenues to be between RMB 16.51 billion and RMB 17.61 billion, or USD 2.32 billion and USD 2.47 billion, representing an increase of 55.4% to 55.6% from the fourth quarter of last year.
This business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary view on the business situation and the market condition, which is subject to change.
Going forward, we believe our nimble and [Inaudible] corporate culture, execution discipline, and strong balance sheet will allow us to face challenging markets head on and continue to deploy capital and resources efficiently to focus on our products and innovation initiatives and drive our long-term growth.
I will now turn the call over to the operator and to start the Q&A session.
Thank you.

"
3734,LI,2022,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"I will take your provision question.
This is Johnny.
And for this provision, it's always related to the raw materials, which means the products already in our inventory or the purchase commitment we made to our suppliers for those inventory and the parts commitment we don't want -- we don't plan to make it into vehicles in the future.
So, the provision was based on the lower of cost and the net realizable value based on our estimate and negotiation with the vendors.
So, it's our estimate for when I finally realized in the next two quarters there will be some minor adjustment to the final amount.
Comparative with quarterly gross margin, it's not very significant.
"
3735,LI,2022,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Hello, this is Johnny.
I will take your first question about R&D expenses.
This year, R&D expenses will adjust as we guided, will be around USD 1 billion, which is RMB 7 billion for the whole year, so, as expected.
And for next year, currently, we see over RMB 10 billion to RMB 12 billion, depending on our final decision on some of our investment.
It will start next year or in 2024.
So, it will be, yeah, RMB 10 billion to RMB 12 billion for next year.

3748,LI,2022,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,0,"Thank you, Janet.
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
I will review our third quarter key highlights.
In the third quarter, we navigated our model succession and launch cycle, as well as a challenging macro environment and supply chain constraint.
Against this backdrop, we delivered 26,524 vehicles, up 5.6% year over year.
Despite a supply chain bottleneck, we delivered over 10,000 Li L9s in September, the model's first full month of production.
This marked the first time that a Chinese-branded premium model priced over RMB 400,000 achieved monthly sales of more than 10,000 vehicles, demonstrating Li L9 as a topic among full-size SUVs for family users.
This success was due to the exceptional strength of our team, their outstanding management of the Li L9 ramp-up process and their skillful collaboration with our supply chain partners.
As Li L9 continues to surpass user expectation with class-leading features in drivability, safety, interior, space, passenger experience, and smartness, demand remained robust, providing constant -- constantly strong order inflow for the model.
Li L9 has been the sales champion among full-size SUVs in China since its delivery started.
Benefiting from a Li L9 strength, our total delivery in October reached 10,052, representing a 31.4% year-over-year increase.
This, followed by a record-breaking 15,034 vehicle deliveries in November.
As always, we would like to extend the sincere gratitude to our over 200,000 Li ONE users.
We will continue to adhere to higher the industry service standards and continue to improve the performance of Li ONE through OTAs.
On September 30th, we launched Li L8, a six-seat premium family SUV that succeeded Li One.
We also unveiled Li L7, a seven-seat flagship family SUV on the same day.
We commenced the deliveries of Li L8 in November.
Let me provide more details of this vehicle.
Li L8 employs our new-generation all-wheel drive range extension system and boasts over 100 features in their standard configurations.
It's available in two trims, Pro and Max, providing users with flexible choices of smartness.
The two trims are harnessed, respectively, with the Li AD Pro and Li AD Max autonomous driving systems.
Pro is powered by the Horizon Robotics Journey 5 chip with 128 TOPS of computing power, while Max is powered by the dual Orin-X chips with 508 TOPS of computing power.
In addition, the two trims are equipped with innovative, smart space systems, SS Pro and SS Max, featuring a first-row four-screen interactive system and a five-screen, three-dimensional interactive system, respectively.
These packages bring a new level of driving and entertainment experience to smart electric vehicles.
We are pleased that Li L8 numerous class-leading feature have delighted its first batch of users, and we believe that their satisfaction for the vehicle has broadly exceeded their expectations.
We are confident that Li L8 will stand among the finest options for six seaters priced over 3,000 -- RMB 300,000, and together with Li L9, the sales champion of full-size SUVs in China, and the Li L7, which we believe will be a top choice among five-seat SUVs priced over RMB 300,000.
We expect it to captivate a broader range of family users with differentiated needs and to gain a larger market share in the RMB 300,000 to RMB 500,000 price segment.
We are encouraged by Li L9's continued strong sales performance and the solid demand for Li L8.
But considering the ongoing supply chain uncertainty, we expected fourth quarter deliveries to be in the range of 45,000 to 48,000 vehicles.
We will continue to collaborate closely with our supply chain partners to react quickly to changes and to mitigate potential risks.
During the third quarter, we continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to vehicle safety.
According to the vehicle safety evaluation results released on November 4th by the China Insurance Automotive Safety Index, or CIASI, Li L9 obtained the G rating, the highest safety rating, in three out of four evaluation categories: occupant safety, pedestrian safety, and assistance safety.
In the category of crashworthiness and repair economy, Li L9 received an M rating, one of the top results received by premium vehicles tested by CIASI since 2017.
In addition, it was the first domestic full-size SUV tested for 25% frontal offset impact on both the driver and passenger sides and achieved the G rating for both tests.
Thanks to its ultra-high-strength body structure, Li L9 also demonstrated class-leading performance with the ability to withstand a peak force of 116,475 Newtons in the roof strength test.
Its roof can withstand a weight of 11.8 pounds on the side, effectively preventing cabin deformation and the safeguard of relatively large head space for drivers and passengers to survive in case of accidents.
We continue to -- we continually improved our vehicles' performance and features through OTA after their delivery.
In early November, we released our OTA 4.1 upgrade for Li L9, further enhancing user experience with our upgraded Li AD autonomous driving system and smart in-car voice assistant, Li Xiang Tong Xue, as well as improve the smart space interactions and entertainment experiences.
In particular, the vehicle's three 15.7-inch 3K automotive grid OLED screens can now project the same events and all game from the three different camera angles, transforming Li L9 into a great sports lounge for families and friends to watch games such as the ongoing FIFA World Cup.
To create successful products, we have two core goals.
Firstly, for consumers, we choose to exceed their needs rather than merely meeting them.
Secondly, as a company, we aim to achieve healthy gross margin and self-sustaining cash flow, which will allow us to continually invest in our dual growth engine of R&D and the business capabilities.
Especially, our R&D efforts will be directed more comprehensively across products, platforms, and systems with a long-term goal of growing into a world-class technology company.
Our business capability, including the commercial supply and organization capabilities with continued investment in R&D and business capability, supported by our healthy gross margin, we will continue to pursue product and commercial success and to foster a healthy long-term development model.
This flywheel has been the strategic focus since our founding and we believe will remain our strategy going forward.
By understanding this business model, you will understand Li Auto more.
Our supply chain remains one of the most significant variables with respect to our deliveries.
We are accelerating supply chain deployment and optimization to build our resistance for fluctuations and to support our rapid growth sales.
Importantly, we are committed to extending our in-house development and manufacturing capability vertically along our supply chain.
Through our forthcoming self-owned manufacturing base and the majority-owned JVs, we expect to be able to self produce both range extenders and the five-in-one electric drive unit that can support our EREV delivery targets.
On the BEV side, we have commenced construction of a semiconductor manufacturing base in high-tech zone of Suzhou, Jiangsu province in the third quarter.
It will focus our R&D and production of automotive-grade power module based on third-generation semiconductor material, silicon carbide.
The power module is a core component of our self-developed eight-volt electric drive system.
Alongside our dedicated investment in supply chain, we continue to expand our direct sales and servicing network and increase our brand awareness with upgraded brand image to view our business expansion.
As of November 30th, 2022, we have 276 retail stores covering 119 cities, as well as 317 service centers and Li Auto-authorized body and paint shops operating in 226 cities.
During the third quarter, we also started to open retail stores in places other than shopping malls, such as automotive theme parks, to diversify our locations and reach more varied target users.
The retail stores we opened at Hangzhou [Inaudible] Auto Theme Park in September is a good example, featuring our new design language and warm colors.
It creates a welcoming, interactive space for visitors.
It also enjoys strong food traffic due to its excellent location and word-of-mouth publicity.
In addition, this store also offers customers a comprehensive and convenient experience with combined showroom and delivery center functions.
The expansion and upgrade of our direct sales and servicing network have boosted both our brand recognition and our ability to fulfill user demand for our compelling products, which we are confident will drive meaningful sales growth going forward.
We will continue to innovate new retail formats, finding new ways to attract more users while providing them with better services and experiences.
Moving to R&D, we believe R&D capability lies at the core of product competitiveness as we scale our company from one to 10.
Therefore, we insist on full stack self-development of core technologies such as electric drive, intelligent space, and autonomous driving systems.
We have spared no effort in solidifying our leadership in the EREV space with continued investment in our new-generation range extension system.
In addition, we are actively self developing the key building blocks of our eight-volt HPC BEV platform, including the power chip, power module, electronic control unit, electric motor, and transmission system, aiming to be one of the first automaker to roll out HPC BEV vehicles.
We are also proud to lead the industry in smart space R&D.
For example, we self-developed our smart space Li AI system powered by MIMO net, a six-zoom human voice enhanced network and the MVS net, a multi-view vision confusion network.
Li AI can help create accurate sound perception in a complex acoustic environment and identify complicated gestures, enabling an unparalleled in-car entertainment and interactive experience.
With respect to autonomous driving, as of November 30th, more than 170,000 family users have enjoyed our highway [Inaudible] feature.
We have further enhanced our vehicles' ability to perceive dynamic obstacles and the static road structures in a complex environment, as well as their ability to forecast traffic participants' action.
We were the first in the industry to extend the concept of 3D hypothesis, 2D verification to multimode sensor, and Li L9 was the first to to realize highway and away based on an NVIDIA Orin SoC chipset.
Meanwhile, we have partnered with Qinghai University and MIT to complete the world's first public project to construct high-precision maps in real time.
Intelligent manufacturing is another core competency for our -- for any successful automaker and another area in which we excel.
First, we have industry-leading manufacturing equipment.
Our fully self-developed manufacturing manual -- management software, Li MOS, can greatly improve production efficiency and quality with precision control during the entire automotive manufacturing process.
This system will be implemented in all our future factories, shortening new factories' deployment cycle by more than three months.
Our R&D efforts are not limited to building a great car but also how to make it.
We use vision sensors and algorithms to precisely control the workflow of hardware equipment in order to realize flexible production and intelligent inspection.
As we strive to enhance our R&D and manufacturing capabilities, we also aspire to make a positive environmental and social impact through our sound governance structure and dedication to sustainable development.
In September 2022, we received an MSCI ESG rating of AA for the second year in a row, maintaining our leadership position in the automotive industry in terms of ESG performance.
Moreover, following the earthquake in Luding County, Sichuan province on September 5th, we made a donation to help the affected people and to support disaster relief efforts.
We hope to play our part as a corporate citizen and a member of the community by helping people in need.
We look forward to sharing more of our ESG endeavors in our next ESG report, which we expect in the first half of next year.
In addition, we have -- we are pleased to be included as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index effective December 5th.
This is a strong recognition of our underlying strength and investment value.
Lastly, as you may have seen from today's press release, from January 1st, 2023, I will no longer serve as the company's president.
I will spend more time to support the company's new round of organizational upgrade to prepare for its future.
In the future, our CEO, Li Xiang, will take over the responsibility of sales and services.
Our newly appointed president, Mr.
Ma Donghui, will be responsible for the overall closed-loop management from product R&D to procurement and supply, production, and manufacturing, and quality.
Xie Yan, our new CTO, will lead the company's R&D team to explore the most advanced underlying technologies in the smart electric vehicle industry.
I would like to thank our investors for the support and trust they have placed in Li Auto and myself.
I firmly believe that Li Auto will continue to achieve great results under the leadership of the new management team and continue to lead the smart new energy vehicle industry in China.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, John, for a closer look of our financial performance.
Please go ahead.
"
3749,LI,2022,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,1,"Yeah.
Tim, you want me answer your first question first, right? OK.
About the outlook of L9, 8, and L7, so, we can only make a judgment based on the competitiveness of this -- this product and also then outlook based on the -- the market size of each of these products, this segment.
So, our outlook is that L9, the stabilized, the monthly US sales should be around 8,000 to 11,000.
That's our estimation.
And for L8 will be 10,000 to 15,000, yeah -- 14,000.
And L7, now it's quite early to to do estimation.
Yeah.
So, basically, the -- the -- for the Q1 outlook, we believe the beginning of Q1, well, our backlog will continue to drive strong delivery performance.
And of course, after Chinese New Year, we need to bring more order in.
We have strong confidence that, in Q1, we'll continue to beat the overall PV market performance.
But, Tim, as you mentioned, there are some factors that beyond our control, like COVID, but we believe we'll beat the overall PV market performance.
"
3750,LI,2022,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,2,"Thank you, Olivia.
Let me take your question.
Your first question about the price cut from the Tesla side, actually, we see a little impact on order flow because of our product right now, L9 and L8, is the -- is the -- the price segment is higher than Tesla's main selling model.
Yeah.
And we would expect the -- the same --same kind of situation next year.
So, yeah, we -- we still have a strong confidence that in this industry turmoil -- turmoil, we'll continue to lead.
Yeah.
For your second question about the supply chain, yeah, of course we -- we -- we are glad to see the -- the -- the new COVID policy that, ultimately, the -- the -- with the -- with the pandemic, will result actually the supply chain get back to normal.
But as we should all know that for the next two, three months, based on the trend we see in other foreign countries, that once the policy change, we -- we may see here and there the manpower shortages.
Yeah.
Right now, we already see some of this kind of manpower shortages impact our production, especially in our suppliers side.
Yeah.
So, we are working closely with our supply chain partners, try to mitigate all these risks, and we even start to prepare some of the workforce ourselves.
Whenever there is a shortage, we'll send the workforce to help our supply -- supply partners.
Yeah.

Operator
Our next question will come from Ming Hsun Lee with Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
"
3752,LI,2022,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,4,"Thank you, Ming.
This is Kevin.
Let me take this question.
Actually, just to clarify, we are not the [Inaudible] -- not manufacturing the silicon carbide chipset.
Actually, we're making the power drive module with the chipset.
So, why we choose to design our own power module is because the power module is closely integrated into our five-in-one electric motors and also three-in-one electric motors.
So, therefore, the -- the thermal solution and the the size of this module are very important for our competitiveness and the energy efficiency.
That's why we choose to build this module by our design and build these modules by ourselves.
Yeah.
Just to clarify.
"
3753,LI,2022,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,5,"Thank you.
So, Shanghai come for 6% to 5% of our sales volume.
Yeah.
So -- so, of course, the policy change, of course, will have some impact on our -- our sales in Shanghai.
But actually, as we should all know, most of the auto customer are not buying a new car.
They are kind of upgrading their car.
So, in theory, they already have the car plate.
So, therefore, we are actively working with our design team to build a new sales strategy for next year, yeah, to mitigate the impact of this policy change.
But again, overall, Shanghai's only like 6% of our sales total volume.
Yeah.
And about the BEV actually are just now -- these are in this course next year.
We're going to have a launch of our first BEV.
Yeah.
"
3754,LI,2022,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,6,"Yeah.
Second question, I think [Foreign language]
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] Actually, since we founded Li Auto, we've always dreamed of becoming a $1 trillion -- or RMB 1 trillion company.
And as you can see, next year, we're expecting to become a RMB 100 billion company already.
So, personally, I have never run a -- built a company from zero one -- $100 billion company from scratch.
And most of my colleagues have not had that experience either.
Most of my colleagues either they come from companies that are smaller than that or they come from companies that became that large years ago, or they they work off of remote office.
They are not headquartered in China.
So, we have seen this issue a long time ago.
So, since 2019, we've been starting to study software and hardware companies that have reached the size of RMB 1 trillion very, very deeply to see how they manage their business at different stages and what we can learn from them.
And one thing in common that we've seen is that they've all transformed to a matrix organization wen they reached the level of about RMB 10 billion.
And so, for Li Auto, when we started from zero one -- speed one efficiency, speed meant everything.
But as time went on, we saw that in a very long value chain where quality and efficiency is very important in our one to 10 stage, quality of efficiency.
So, a successful enterprise will need to be able to -- for their internal purposes, we need to have a very robust planning perception, execution process.
And for their customers, they need very strong R&D, strong product, sales, and services.
So, the matrix organization was the only way to manage this entire process end to end.
To make an analogy, the horizontal teams make sure that they built the roads, they maintain the roads, and the good -- the roads are good to run for vehicles.
And the vertical teams are the ones that build cars, maintain the fleet, and make sure the cars run smoothly on the road, and these cars on the well built and maintained roads are responsible for delivering goods, services, and products to our -- our consumers, which forms a very healthy cycle.
So, we first started piloting this thought in what we call IPD, integrated product development.
And the process has actually been validated by the success of L9, L8 and 7, where you might have seen the success of Li ONE which, you know, in certain view, could be a coincidence.
But through the application of IPD, we've made that a certainty so that we can replicate the success with our current and ongoing future product development.
So, we are now in the process of applying our pilot process in a much larger scale to make sure that our -- our company can continue to churn out successful products and services to our customers.
Operator
And our last question will come from Jing Chang with CICC.
Please go ahead.
"
3755,LI,2022,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,7,"Yeah.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] If we look back to 2020, until now, our R&D spending mostly fall into three areas.
The first area is product development, which you see similar exercises in traditional car OEMs.
The second one is technological platforms, including our REV platform, our high-voltage BEV platform, our smart space platform, autonomous driving platform.
These are shared platforms that all of our vehicles use.
The platform innovation allow us to maximize cost -- or the cost efficiency, R&D efficiency, and user experience, and make sure that they're consistent across all products of our company.
The third one is new and fast growing is our system development, which includes supercomputing, typically in platform -- cloud computing platform on our IT infrastructure.
These are very long term but crucial, important investments for our company.
And in terms of organization, our product and technological platforms are run by Mr.
Ma Donghui, and system development is run by our CTO, Xie Yan.
And in terms of spending level, we spend the most today in technical platforms, followed by product, and then, thirdly, system infrastructure.
And going forward, we expect to see more spending in system and infrastructure, which might eventually overtake technological infrastructure because we think, in the longest term, our -- the most crucial investment or our competitive advantage lies in our system and infrastructure capability.

3767,LI,2022,2,paul-gong,ubs,True,0,"[Foreign language] So just translate my two questions.
The first question is regarding the cannibalization of L9 versus Li ONE.
How much of the recent weakness of the Li ONE orders is due to the cannibalization of the new model and how much of it do you think yes is due to the weakening macro environment as well as the weakening demand for the cars in general? My second question is regarding the features.
So the key highlights of the BEV, I think management previously mentioned that the BEVs and EREV, they should be -- based on different models, they have different features.
And can you give us a little bit of color? How shall we think about the uniqueness or the attractiveness of your BEV view of such a crowded markets in the BEV market already?

3780,LI,2022,2,tim-hsiao,morgan-stanley,True,0,"[Foreign language] So my first question, just wanted to follow up on the quarter guidance, because I think third-quarter volume guidance of 27,000 to 29,000 -- conservative.
So considering the launch of L9 and improving supply dynamic.
Should we attribute the conservative sell valid to the transition of Li ONE only or as the production ramp up of L9 is there any expectation or if there is any other reason we should take into consideration.
So just simply due to the hiccup for Li ONE, how long do we should we expect this kind of impact will last? And my second question is about the sales mix of EREV, the plug-in hybrid and BEV next year.
How should we think about the mix in 2023 and could you provide some updates regarding the numbers of new models? If the mix of the BEV is going to increase substantially next year, should we concern about potential dilution to our margin or could that hurt our cash flow? So those are my two questions.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
I will review the key highlights of the second quarter and discuss our flagship mark SUV Li L9 which has received highly positive feedback from family users for its best-in-class combination of drivability, safety, comfort, and intelligence.
We witnessed continued consumer adoption of EVs in the second quarter.
China's retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles surpassed 1.17 million during this quarter, more than doubled year over year according to the China Passenger Car Association with penetration rates climbing to 27.1% from 21.8% in the first quarter.
We believe it will continue to rise, supported by more AEV model launches, continuous iterations of smart features, and the increasing user preference for clean mobility.
We remain focused on offering state-of-the-art products to our family users.
Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 resurgence across cities national light from March to May we delivered 28,687 vehicles during the second quarter, representing a 63.2% year-over-year increase.
These strong delivery results contributed to 73.3% year-over-year increase in total revenues, which totaled RMB 8.73 billion.
Our deliveries in July reached 10,422, up 21.3% year over year.
On August 1st, we proudly rolled the 200,000 Li ONE off the production line at our Changzhou manufacturing base.
It took us just 986-days to reach this production milestone.
Once again, setting a record speed among China's emerging EV manufacturers following our historic speed in reaching the 100,000 unit mark.
Li ONE is also the first domestic branded premium model priced above RMB 300,000 to achieve this production milestone.
Moving to our supply chain, the COVID-19 resurgence severely affected the auto supply chain in the second quarter.
Currently, there are remaining disruption and difficulties.
But they moderated as the pandemic became more campaigned.
Although we are cautiously optimistic that our supply chain will normalize in the second half of the year.
We should highlight that potential volatility remain and require us to constantly stay on high alert, especially given the ongoing pandemic.
As we navigate the continuous unpredictability, we are focused on reinforcing our supply chain system, strengthening our partnership with parts suppliers to tackle parts shortage and the cost inflation and at the same time redoubled our emphasize on auto parts quality control.
Now moving to profitability in the second quarter, we continue to see that the power of our product, our execution consistency, and our operational resilience enable us to mitigate the cost inflation that we have been experiencing along with the rest of the industry.
As a result, our second quarter gross margin remained relatively solid at 21.5%, up 2.6% year over year as we remain devoted to R&D and network extension to fuel our future growth.
Our operating expense increased by 91.9% year over year.
Meanwhile, we continued to optimize our cost structure and manage our cash flow effectively.
Despite the pandemic's impact, we achieved another quarter of positive operating cash flow of RMB 1.13 billion and free cash flow of RMB 451.7 million.
As part of our efforts to accelerate growth and accommodate additional user demand with new model launches, we continue to expand our direct sales and servicing network.
As of July 31st, we had 259 retail stores covering 118 cities as well as 311 services center and the Li Auto authorized body and paint shops are printing in 226 cities.
While the pace of our sales network expansion have been challenged by the COVID-19 resurgence, we will strive to further extend our reach to users by upgrading our existing stores.
In order to optimize charging experience for our users, we also rolled out the charging map function in our Li Auto application are August 17th.
The map covers over 30,000 charging stations and the 300,000 charging posts in 31 provinces and over 300 cities.
From the six main charging station operators including State Grid and [Inaudible] and others, providing convenient energy replenishment options for our users.
On June 21st, we unveiled Li L9 our flagship smart SUV.
Reflecting our intense focus on family users, we developed Li L9 to create a Mobile Home, Create Happiness.
Thanks to our relentless R&D efforts and outstanding product definition capabilities.
Li L9 boosts cutting-edge premium features to provide outstanding handling and automates comfort and safety.
Every Li L9 comes standard with our flagship full stack self-developed autonomous driving system.
Li AD Max is enhanced the functionality bolstered by upgraded perception and vehicle control capability was highly recognized by users in the test drives.
As the first volume production vehicle with redundancy design, applied to its powertrain, steering system, braking system, and the power supply system for the computing platform.
It offers enhanced reliability and safety.
Supported by a computing platform composed of two Qualcomm Snapdragon automotive grade 8155 chips, and our enhanced deep learning-based multimode interactive technology.
Li L9 provides a smart interior space featuring five-screen three-dimensional interactions for family members for all ages.
We have received the positive feedback along with very strong order intake for the LI L9, particularly from our target family users.
We will commence delivery of Li L9 by the end of August.
While we forge ahead with our new model launches.
We also continue to pursue optimization for our existing product.
In June, we released the OTA 3.1 update for the Li ONE taking the Li ONE user experience to the next level.
This update feature a highly anticipated remote vehicle control function, allowing users to move the vehicle forward and backward in a straight line through our mobile application.
This remote capability greatly increases users' convenience and improve their ability to park in narrow spaces.
The update also include an audio equalizer function, and the further optimization of our fully self-developed OTA function with enhanced accuracy for recommended length change, and the ramp entry or exit.
Furthermore, we are steadily working on our plan of launching high-power charging BEV model next year.
We are also working on deploying our HPC network to support our HPC BEV.
Li L9 will be the first model in the industry to adopt the video orient platform to deliver advanced autonomous driving features, including NOA function, showcasing our strong R&D capability with high efficiency.
Our self-developed autonomous driving algorithm have won much public recognition internationally.
For example, we ranked the first in the 2021 New Thing's 3D vision detection and tracking tasks, and also won first place in the ICCV 2021 Workshop Interpret Challenging.
We also have the largest number of autonomous driving users in China as of July 31st this year.
Users with access to an OTA function exceeded 130,000.
The technology knowledge and insights accumulated through Li ONE gives us the advantage by helping us enhance our R&D efficiency during the Li L9 development process, refined products and further optimize the safety and performance of autonomous driving.
In summary, we will continue to create happiness and the value for our family users by honing our existing products and expanding our model lineup, while enhancing our brand recognition for family users.
We will also execute on our technology roadmap to solidify our lead in EREVs and advanced our HPC BEV development.
With that, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Johnny, for a closer look at our financial performance.
Please go ahead.
"
3784,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,1,"Alright.
Well, Fei, this is Kevin.
Thank you for the question.
So your first question.
For the guideline, actually, we still stick to our previous projects and that for September, we are going to ship more than 10,000 L9.
And for your second question, for gross margin L9 will be higher, increased high-end product.
Your second question about the traction right now, although, last month, we already kind of received almost the 30K order of L9.
Today in the past two weeks, we still see a strong demand coming for L9.
"
3785,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,2,"Yes.
In fact, the L9 has a very unique product positioning, actually, in this price band with this kind of size and smart features.
We don't see there are any products that have kind of a product proposition close to our L9.
Right now, it is more about how much we can convert our customer to place order on our L9, when they have the budget between RMB 400K to RMB 500K.
"
3786,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,3,"Yes.
Tim this is Kevin.
Thank you for your question.
About the first question, in fact the -- when we give out this guidance, of course, we have seen some slowdown of the Li ONE order intake.
I think primarily the issue right now is that when we have the new product into our retail stores, a lot of attention has been attracted by the new product, rather than the old product, actually, we are working with our sales team to regain the attention from our potential customers for Li ONE.
So on the other hand, about the potential launch of the new product, actually, the only comment I can give right now is that it will coming soon and will come sooner than the expectation.
Yes, that is the only comment I can give.
And about the new product and model, BEV model we are going to launch -- we plan to launch next year.
In fact, as you can expect that for any new model we launch into the market we have intention to increase the revenue also to improve our cash flow, improve our profitability.
So, therefore, with the new BEV model in our plan, we plan reasonable profitability of cost so it won't hurt our cash flow, it won't hurt our gross margin next year.
"
3787,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,4,"Thank you for your question.
First of all about the week in time, actually the week in time right now is of course shorter than last month.
As I already explained that the order intake is slower right now so therefore we can turn over the delivery faster.
And about the RMB 7,000 kind of a promotion.
Actually, you got the information very updated that we kind of released this policy just this Sunday.
About the new product you are asking about, I think the same answer, I already provided that it will come soon and the sooner than our expectation.
"
3788,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,5,"Paul, this is Kevin.
I will take your first question and Xiang Li will address the second question.
The first question, the thing is that before we putting the car, L9 into our retail stores before people start to test drive it actually a we see no change of the order intake pattern of the Li ONE.
But it is to a certain extent days, to our surprise that when we have the customer coming into the stores, to test drive some of the customer our original plan was to test drive Li ONE, but when they see L9 and when they after the test drive to L9.
We see especially the customer with enough budget, we see a lot of them converted to our L9 customer.
So right now, as I just say explained that that is why one of the reason why we also have some more promotion plans for Li ONE, yes.
And I think but on the other hand, we still have a confidence that Li ONE is still a very competitive product, because if we compare it with the existing products other than L9 other products are in the same price band RMB 300k to RMB 400k price then Li ONE is a still one of the most competitive product in the market.
"
3789,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,6,"Yes.
This is Kevin.
Thank you for the question.
The first question is about the battery cost.
Actually, as we all know that the in the recent months that the raw material for battery has come down a little bit, but we would expect that for the coming months this year, the raw material cost will again fluctuate a lot.
So therefore for the gross margin outlook it is a lot of time are based on the best cost.
Therefore I can only comment down the battery cost will be kind of a half fluctuation.
And for the new products that competitiveness, I will ask Li Xiang to comment.
"
3790,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,7,"So I have a short answer for the first question.
In terms of the body type for electric vehicle, I still want to keep it confidential before it is released, because it is very unique design.
"
3791,LI,2022,2,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,8,
3792,LI,2022,2,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,0,"[Foreign language] So maybe two angles, that differentiation.
The first one is around charging.
In fact, we already have a prototype running right now that can charge 400 kilometers of range in 10 minutes.
And the goal here is very similar to range extender vehicle, which is to replace all internal combustion engine vehicle for customers and have no anxiety in terms of range.
Our data shows that among our L9 customers, 80% of them have home charging, and 100% of them have stable charging, either at home or in the office.
So home charging are often charging is really not the key here.
The key challenge is to enable customers to travel freely within key economic zones within China.
For example, the Yangtze River Delta region, the Beijing Tangent region, Wuhan and big mega city areas we will support with high power charging so that customers can drive long distances, but no driving with no range anxiety, even if they are driving electric vehicles.
So the second advantage when it comes to electric vehicles is space, because of the engineering possibility enabled by electric vehicles and new architectures and new body types.
We can provide a lot more space in our electric vehicles compared to range extender vehicles with the same footprint.
"
3793,LI,2022,2,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Yes.
The capacity is 15,000 for L9.
"
3794,LI,2022,2,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,2,"Thank you.
[Foreign language]
Operator
The next question comes from Ming Lee from Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
"
3795,LI,2022,2,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,3,"[Foreign language] So right now around L8 I can share two things.
One is that it will be delivered released much sooner than many people expecting are expecting.
And the second thing is that the period from release to delivery will be shorter than L9.
And when L8 is available, I think that would be a good time to compare the product competitiveness with newly released competitors and we have full confidence that we will dominate all these products with our L8.
"
3796,LI,2022,2,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,4,"[Foreign language] So talking about Range Extended Vehicles if you are looking over the next five years, we still believe that our REV is the best solution for SUVs period.
I will give you one example if you are looking at BYD, there are two main products above RMB 200,000.
There is a Hong sedan, and there is Tang SUV.
So in terms of Hong, which is a sedan, the REV sells much better than DMI which is the hybrid vehicle.
But for Tang, the case is exactly the opposite DMI sells better than REV.
And the reason for that is when people buy cars in the RMB 200,000, RMB 300,000 range, when they buy an SUV, they have a very clear expectation that they want to go on longer trips, especially post-COVID.
So our EV still the best solution up until today for SUV that solves range anxiety.
So under that consumption within our biggest goal is to solve the efficiency challenge.
And if you look at L9, there is many top media that have tested the L9.
Our energy consumption levels filled leading in its class.
Even with low SoC, the fuel consumption is only around 60% of much smaller internal combustion engine vehicles and it is much better than well many claim to the competitors, which are much smaller SUVs.
Because at the end of the day, REV is as an EV is not an internal combustion engine, adding a battery to it.
So that is the key difference between PHEVs and our range-extended electric vehicles.
There shouldn't be any discussion of which one is more advanced or which one is more backwards.
For the users range extender vehicles is an EV that happens to have an internal combustion engine or we call range extender, whereas PHEV is really more of an internal combustion engine vehicle with a battery.
I will give you another example.
Chrysler, which is a very established company with very capable technical skills, and their latest vehicle FL03 is an REV rather than PHEV.
Despite the fact that -- has all the PHEV technologies in the world, but they still build in our REV as their most advanced solution.
Because at the end of the day again, REV is really an electric vehicle.
So the second question about the cash flow and ATM offering.
I think first the Auto has very healthy operating cash flow and free cash flow, which can fuel our business I recall that.
But in the long run we are the very clear we are still at the current state of art industry in 10 years to 15 years.
So we still want to use that active market to secure more cash to further fund the company's development, especially in the R&D and also the new model R&D site.
For the ATM offering I think we bid on this year saw our market condition.
As I just mentioned, we still want to secure more cash from the equity offerings.
So we chose the ATM to do this.
As most of the ATM offerings, we need to stop before we publish our earnings release.
So hopefully we can finish this it can offer in the coming market?
"
3797,LI,2022,2,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"And now those were added to Allegiant we still serve our family customers with our EVs and for the operating expenses.
I think we have a very clear roadmap on our product and our goal for this next year sales target.
So we will keep going to events on the R&D side and also on the network expansion to better serve our family customers.

So first question is about EREV product with our midterm competitiveness strategy for your EREV product? And the second question is about money raising.
Could you please talk a little bit more about ATM and further capital reserve project? Thank you.

The next question comes from Jiong Shao from Barclays.
Please go ahead.
"
3801,LI,2022,2,xu-yingbo,citic-group,True,2,
3802,LI,2022,2,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Great.
Yes.
Thanks for taking my question.
Now the second quarter performance was impressive despite COVID and L9 has outstanding traction for its price point.
So congratulations on those, they were well done.
My question is about your guidance.
So the third quarter is in question for the 27,000 to 29,000 unit guidance that you provided, can you break it out by Li ONE and L9 and also as you ramp the production off the high ASP L9 but will gross margin improve? So that is the first question.
My second question is about L9's retail traction.
So the company disclosed the early August that L9 has received 30,000 confirm orders.
So just wonder if we can have a refreshed discussion in terms of this latest retail trend feedback, especially competition with the other new energy SUVs and MPVs that some of your EVPs have put in the market.
[Foreign language]
"
3803,LI,2022,2,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,1,"OK.
Got it.
So part of my second question was to perhaps Kevin.
If you can comment on sort of L9 in the context of this competition with other SUVs and MPVs that some of your competitors have put in the market.
But as far as BYD and so on and so forth.
Are you seeing competitive threat from them that sort of cause you to change your strategy or introduce more marketing incentives in front of customers?
"
3804,LI,2022,2,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,2,"OK.
That is helpful.

3806,LI,2021,1,bin-wang,credit-suisse,True,0,"Thank you for taking my question.
First, I'll go to the price about the top-selling software in the [Inaudible] payments.
But you actually raised the price by RMB 10,000.
Can I actually try to elaborate is that is RMB 10,000 matches the price for the software? Can I have this kind of explanation of light.
That's number one.
And number two actually, I found one company call [Foreign language] actually [Inaudible] naturally I speak involved in your R&D at Level 3.
The polls have been [Inaudible].
So basically, it's the same product as the Li ONE 2021 version.
Is this company one of your supplier? And actually, they don't have this full-stack in-house design.
Actually, what's their role of [Foreign language] in this project? [Foreign language]

3809,LI,2021,1,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Hi, Tim.
For the gross margin, in the long run, it's -- the volume remained at the same level of the current Li ONE, with some additional hardware, as you may know, for the NOA parts and also some savings from traditional parts like the rear model.
It's net-net.
And for the second quarter, I think it will be a net of April, May with some promotion on the current new -- the current Li ONE and also with one-month new Li ONE with RMB 10,000 sales price [Inaudible].
So it will be a mix. 
"
3810,LI,2021,1,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yes.
So regarding the role of [Foreign language].
It's our hardware Tier 1 provider.
So the role of [Foreign language] is mainly about product validation and also of design coordination together with our team, and then the final production.
So as we already mentioned, actually, for our ADAS team, we have run about 300 people right now covering both hardware and software design.
So software-wise, we already explained.
It's full-stack in-house software development, including the low-level software like OS and also the middleware and all application software and closed-loop H to cloud environment completely, for software parts.
Actually, we also designed the hardware part to ensure that we have the complete transparency of the design so that we can react if there are something wrong with our design during the lifecycle of the product.
So we are also responsible for the complete hardware design simulation and design validation.
So including those electronics and in case.
Now, the role of [Foreign language], they will participate with the hardware design because from an efficiency point of view, we will like to leverage the outsource resources to ensure we keep that in a very high level.
So overall, they will do the coordination, the product validation, and then the production, which we -- on purpose, we don't want to touch because that will lower the efficient -- overall efficiency and also that's the part actually Tier 1 could have a better efficiency compared with OEM.
Thank you. 
"
3811,LI,2021,1,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"OK, clearly, I take the first question.
So regarding different platforms.
So actually, that's the reason why we would like to do the in-house design.
So when you have controlled algorithm development.
You know, there are course of algorithms.
Basically, we utilize the same mechanism behind.
So when we're developing something, and then you can really based on different hardware maker kind of record software, then we can support different containers basically.
That's our idea behind.
And from compatibility point of view, there are really lots of common area you can reuse.
And also, on top of that, so you can see the current development, we do have the H part and also the cloud part.
The cloud part, we utilize mass computing power for train.
So both Journey 3 platform and Orin platform, we have the same NVIDIA solution behind or train.
So you can see right away, there are already a bunch of common stocks you can share.
So then, we don't have any problem.
Of course, if you support more, then you need let's say more effort for adaptation between platforms.
So we will lower that, of course, then there's smart selection as we've mentioned.
That's the reason why we have a very strict criteria for SMC selection.
Thank you.

Two questions.
The first one is you have to reach for the mobile IQ4 to of this Journey 3 and going straight to NVIDIA Orin next year.
How do you see the data format of all these three systems? Can you freely use the data connected in the previous system and to use now and for the develop for the future ADAS function or use it seamless transition? The second question is regarding your BEV plan for 2023.
You mentioned the Whale and the Shark platform.
How do to think after seeing the Shanghai Auto Show with so many new BEV models, will this change target of your timeline, your roadmap, would you affected to the process or debates in view of the rising competition in the market? Thank you.

Thanks for taking my question.
So, I've got two questions.
The first question, could you please update your effective capacity at the moment with the output of new Li ONE models suffer from greater impact for the component bottleneck? For example, like chip and chip shortage, or in the battery time-outs, or any other key components.
And if that's the case, when do we expect the output of the new Li ONE? Could it get back to a more normal level? My second question is how's the gross margin of the new Li ONE compared to the previous version? With a 10,000 price hike, it'll be more than enough to offset the cost increase from the feature upgrade and raw material inflation and further again the second-quarter gross margin.

3825,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,0,"Thank you, Janet.
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
I will review the key highlights of the first quarter as well as our newly released 2021 Li ONE, which offers best-in-class PHEV, efficiency, comfort, and intelligence.
In the first quarter, we delivered 12,579 Li ONE, up 334.4% year over year, which brought about total revenue of RMB 3.58 billion, 319.8% higher than the first quarter of 2020, and exceeding the top end of our revenue guidance by 11.2%.
In the first quarter, our Li ONE was the second best-selling new energy SUV in China.
As our compelling product offering and superior user experience continue to delight customers and enhance brand awareness as well as the wavering support of our direct sales and servicing network underpins our growth.
We were also the only domestic brand ranked in the top 10 best seller among all premium SUVs in the first quarter.
In April, Li ONE remained the first among all new energy SUVs in China.
In the rankings, including ICE cars, BEV, EREV, and PHEV, Li ONE ranked second in the large SUV segment and fourth in the premium SUV segment.
On the profitability side, our gross margins stayed robust at 17.3% amid our ongoing efforts to enhance investment in R&D as well as to expand our direct sales and servicing network.
Our expanding -- operating expenses increased by 238.6% year over year and 27.5% quarter over quarter.
Despite the deliberate increase on the expense side, we continued with the disciplined cash flow management strategy.
Our free cash flow remained positive at RMB 570.2 million.
We also raised over US$840 million in net proceeds through our successful convertible senior notes offering in April, strengthening our capital base for future growth as we increased our R&D investment in leading technologies, prepared for new model launches, and gear up for a further increase in demand.
We view our direct sales and servicing network as an integral component of our close-to-loop system that allows us to iteratively improve product features and add new functions for our users by accelerating the expansion of our direct sales and servicing network.
We remain committed to proactively serving our users and anticipating future demand for our pipeline vehicles.
As of April 30, 2021, we have 73 retail stores covering 53 cities, 143 servicing centers, and the auto -- authorized body and paint shops operating in 105 cities.
We are on track to reach our year-end target of 200 retail stores.
We have also started reconfiguring our state-of-the-art Changzhou factory for a new model pipeline, especially the full-sized premium SUV based on the next generation EREV platform to be launched in 2022.
As a user-driven automotive and technology enterprise, we deeply value the tremendous trust and support our users bestow on us during the 19th International Automotive Industry Exhibition in April.
A large team of Li ONE owners came to our exhibition to volunteer as brand ambassadors, sharing their experience with the vehicle, their passion for it, and their acknowledgment of the value that Li ONE brings to their family's everyday life.
One of them, a Li ONE owner for 11 months, said that Li Auto is not only a car rep but also a spiritual partner.
It is an integral part of our lives now.
We are so grateful to see our mission and the vision being recognized and echoed by our users.
As of April 30, our cumulatively Li ONE deliveries have exceeded 50,000 units.
We took only 17 months to reach this milestone from the first delivery of Li ONE in December 2019, creating the fastest record among all new energy vehicle companies.
Our users have driven over 500 million kilometers with more than 65 million kilometers assisted by our data solution at the daily active rate of over 30%.
In terms of self-safety, over 800 million early warnings were triggered, preventing more than 10,000 potential serious accidents.
While Li ONE's extensive powertrain and ADAS solution that are a standard configuration enable a more free and safe travel experience for our users.
Its intelligent cockpit featuring a comprehensive entertainment system is another highlight of the vehicle.
We pioneered the four-screen interactive in-car system that has been widely praised by our users for the smart space of mobility.
It allows the users and each passenger to offer private usage and voice space interactive connections.
On average, users spend more than 40 minutes in our Li ONE every day while the car itself is parked.
Our in-car karaoke function, which was first released before the Chinese New Year holiday, provided on-demand karaoke more than 30,000 times during the Chinese New Year holiday, and more than 18,000 times during the May Day holiday.
Affirming our long-standing dream of creating extension homes that brings happiness to the entire family, Li ONE is a proven success catering to the needs of families in China and has effectively addressed the current challenge to BEVs in terms of energy replenishment.
The success of Li ONE demonstrates our extraordinary productivity-defining capability, which lays a solid foundation for the development of our future models.
We will continue to develop new MEV models with best-in-class performance.
In parallel, we are developing our next-generation extended REV platform and high 13.5% quarter over quarter.
Vehicle marketing in the first quarter of 2021 was 15.9%, compared with 8.4% in the same quarter of 2020, and 17.1% first quarter of 2020.
The increase in vehicle marketing over the first quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to lower material cost and the lower unit manufacturing overhead cost derived from the increased production volume.
The slight decrease in vehicle margin from the first quarter of 2020 from the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily due to the lower average selling price cost by promotion activities launched in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by the decreased material costs.
Our gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 17.3%, compared to 8% in the first quarter of 2020 and 17.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was mainly attributable to the change of vehicle margin.
Now, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were RMB 1.02 billion or US$156.4 million, representing an increase of 238.6% year over year and the increase of 27.5% quarter over quarter.
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were RMB 5145 million or US$78.5 million, representing an increase of 171.2% in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 37.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses were RMB 397.9 million or US$50.7 million, representing an increase of 109.8% year over year and an increase of 7.8% quarter over quarter.
The increase in research and development expenses over the first and fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to first, on increased share-based compensation expenses derived from incremental share options granted with higher fair value in January 2021, while no share-based compensation expenses were recognized for stock options with service conditions under performance conditions related to our IPO in the first quarter of 2020; second, the increase in R&D activities for the company's next vehicle models; and third, increased headcount.
General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were RMB 509.9 million or US$77.8 million, representing an increase of 352% in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 18.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses were RMB 449.8 million or US$68.7million, representing an increase of 298.8% year over year and an increase of 5.4% quarter over quarter.
The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses over the first and fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by increased marketing and promotion activities, increased headcount, and rental expenses with the expansion of the company's sales network, and increased share-based compensation expenses.
Losses from operations in the first quarter of 2021 was RMB 407.7 million or US$62.2 million, representing an increase of 74.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 416.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, our non-GAAP loss from operations was RMB 224.8 million or US$34.3 million, representing a decrease of 4% year over year and an increase of 215.2% quarter over quarter.
Net loss was RMB 360 million or US$54.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, comparing with RMB 77.1 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 and RMB 107.5 million net income in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Non-GAAP net loss was RMB 177 million or US$27 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with RMB 253.4 million net loss in the first quarter of 2010 and RMB 115.4 million net income in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits, and short-term investments total -- totaled RMB 30.36 billion or US$4.63 billion as of March 31, 2021.
Operating cash flow in the first quarter of 2021 was RMB 926.3 million or US$141.4.
Free cash flow was RMB 570.2 million or US$87 million in the first quarter of 2021.
And now, our business outlook for the second quarter of 2021.
The company expects deliveries to be between 14,500 and 15,500 vehicles, representing an increase of 119.6six% to 134.7% from the second quarter of 2020.
The company also expects second-quarter total revenues to be between RMB 3.99 billion and RMB 4.27 billion or between US$609.0 million and US$641.7 million, representing an increase of 104.6% to 119% from the second quarter of 2020.
I will now hand the call over to the operator for the Q&A session.

Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you.
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Hsiao of Morgan Stanley.
Your line is open.
Please go ahead.
"
3826,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,1,"Thank you, Tim.
This is Kevin.
I will answer the first question.
Of course, as we all know, we are -- the whole industry is suffering from the shortage of the semiconductor.
Right now, in terms of our capacity, our Changzhou factory, with two shifts already ready, we can do more than 500 per day.
But of course, due to the ramp of the new Li ONE and also the -- some of the timing issue of the chips, we are -- the volume cannot achieve that high.
We expect, starting from September, we expect our monthly production will be more than 10,000.
And I will ask Johnny to answer the gross margin.
"
3827,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,2,"OK.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question is from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs.
Your line is open.
Please go ahead.
"
3828,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,3,"OK.
Thank you, Fang Fei.
I will answer your question.
So as of today, right now, we have 75 stores.
And in the first quarter, because of the impact of the spring festival and some areas have COVID-19 outbreaks, the pace of the opening new stores was a bit slow than our expectation.
However, we have been making a very good progress in site selection.
In fact, right now, we have another 50 stores in our pipeline actually under construction.
So, therefore, the -- for the whole year, the 200 retail store targets remain unchanged.
Yeah, we are just a little bit behind the track.
We think we'll catch up in the second half.
And for the pricing strategy, the methodology we took is to price our product based on its value to the customer, yeah.
And Li ONE is very, very competitive and delivered a lot of value.
And with more feature functions we added into the new Li ONE, we think just RMB 10,000 higher price is very fair, yeah.
And the new Li ONE will be even more competitive than its predecessor.
"
3829,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,4,"Thank you, Mr.
Lee.
Kai, do you want to take these two questions? Thank you. 
"
3830,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,5,"OK.
Thank you, Wang Bin.
I will take the first question.
Actually, the RMB 10,000 is not specifically for NOA or for any new feature of the new Li ONE.
It's just the -- as just as I explained, this is overall our pricing strategy.
And Mr.
Li Xiang already stated that the safety standards, not the optional.
Therefore, we make all the new ADAS solution a standard function without any charge to our customer.
The second question, I will ask Tie to comment.
Tie?
"
3831,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,6,"Yeah.
Paul, this is Kevin.
Let me take the -- your second question.
Of course, we all see a lot of a new car models launched in Shanghai Auto Show.
However, as we reiterate too many times that we think they are a charging solution is the key competitive advantage we need to gain to compete in the BEV arena.
Therefore, we'll stay on our track to develop our Shark and Whale platforms with ultra-fast charging capability.
We think that's the key to winning the future competition.
Yeah.
So, therefore, we will not alter our trend.
Yeah, we'll stay very focused.
Of course, with the more resources, we are, of course, want to accelerate the R&D process for sure.
But right now, the outlook is still in 2023.
Yeah. 
"
3832,LI,2021,1,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,7,
3833,LI,2021,1,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Yes.
Thanks, management, for the opportunity.
I have two questions.
First, about your store number.
So, you reported 52 stores by the end of 2020 and then you reported 73 stores by April, and then you guided 200 stores by year-end.
So what that means is that you have added 21 stores in the first four months of the year, but you plan to add 130 stores in the next eight months.
Is that the right way to look at it? And also, 130 stores in eight months is not something that we've seen before.
So is there any execution risk with regard to that? Second is about pricing.
Now you've raised prices in the phase lift, which is always very different from some of your competitors or other EV manufacturers who have lowered prices over time.
So does that mean that Li Auto plans to move further into the premium segment in the forward product cycles? Thanks.
[Foreign language]
"
3834,LI,2021,1,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,1,"Yeah.
Thanks for the comment.
Operator
Thank you.
The next question is from the line of Ming-Hsun Lee of BofA Securities.
Your line is open.
Please go ahead. 
"
3835,LI,2021,1,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,2,
3836,LI,2021,1,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,0,"Yes.
OK.
Thank you.
So basically, we have five criteria for SoC selection.
So basically, that can explain why we choose our Journey 3 from Horizon Robotics as our SoC supplier.
So the first one is the performance.
Of course, when we define the feature we want to achieve and the performance of the chipset must meet the requirement.
And from that perspective, Journey 3 is enough for the target.
The target is Level 2-plus functions with, for example, NOA features.
And then the second criteria is the openness and flexibility.
So for example, our previous generation, we use Mobileye, so it's not very flexible for our own algorithm development.
So from that perspective, both ORing and Journey 3, they are more open, and we can use our own algorithm there.
So the third criteria is about the support.
We need a very solid support from our supplier so that we can keep our high-speed, let's say, development and also the phase of iteration.
So Journey 3 is from Horizon Robotics.
Their headquarter is also in Beijing.
So from that perspective, they can provide the best service or support locally.
So the reaction of this interaction between economies is much more convenient.
The fourth criteria is regarding the SOP timing.
So the chipset today will evolve every year.
There will be new chipset available from the market.
So from the timeline, we SOP our 2021 Li ONE, but Journey 3 is better.
So the fifth, but not the least, criteria is the price.
So the price of Journey 3 can offer capable performance.
At the same time, the price is affordable.
So basically, overall, these five criteria eventually come out [Inaudible] idea that we use Journey 3 here.
Regarding the roadmap of our autonomy, so we already mentioned in the previous description that we will, by now, just right away, launch our in-house algorithm to support Level 2 ADAS functions with our own perception, own prediction, planning, execution, and software.
And then the fourth quarter, we will provide NOA because we need some time for the adaptation of the HD map covering more and more roads and areas in China.
So -- and then the next year, we already introduce the let's say the next-generation platform on basis of Orin.
And that one, we will provide even much more processing power and then even richer [Inaudible] and support more futures hub.
So hardware-wise, we can even up to a Level 4.
For software-wise, of course, we need to step by step release more function of Li [Inaudible].
That's the plan in general.
Thank you.

Question number one is about you just mentioned in March 7, you actually got electrical for a handset technology impacts.
That means you can be eligible for the Shenzhen Hong Kong stock connect to get a source for money? That's number one.
And number two is about only the credit, you're actually looking around RMB200 million revenue for the credit in the '21.
So I guess was the proper amount in the '22, because you got almost more than 1% to 2% growth in '21 that is the most also help for margin and profit.
And that's why they got a last minute to secure its bidding.
Can you explain what's the reason behind the secure bidding? Thank you.

Our first question comes from the line of Fei Fang from Goldman Sachs.
Please ask your question.
"
3842,LI,2021,4,johnny-tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
This is Johnny.
Thank you, Bin Wang.
And first of all for the connect.
According to the latest press release by our index, we have been included in the large-cap index, and also to be included in the connect, we need to meet a relevant requirements on market cap and the transaction volume.
And we expect to be included in the connect in middle March after we are listed for six months and plus 20 transaction days.
It will be around that.
And for the EV credit.
For 2021, we have over about two to three times of our EV scores compared with 2022.
That you called from the sales volume, but as everyone may aware, the per score price will be lower than last year.
So we are still negotiating with the potential payer of those EV costs.
Yes.
Hopefully, that will come up around the third quarter that's like last year, yes.
And for the second question, I think we can just refer to the press release.

3844,LI,2021,4,paul-gong,ubs,True,0,"[Foreign language] So two questions, the first question is regarding the future differentiation.
Right now the several EV start-ups all have the uniqueness.
How do you think going forward when everyone is working on the Autonomous driving, everyone is going to use LiDAR, everyone is going to produce BEV as well.
So what would be the key competitiveness, is it further innovation? Is that revolution of the technology or is it more focused on the efficiency of the operation, the second question is regarding the globalization.
We have observed that some peers has already expanded to European markets, how you also think of the globalization, both in the near-term plan as well as in the long run?

My question is really about strategic positioning and product positioning.
Management talked about the focus on having the best product for the family use.
Is the family sort of use case still the focus remained the focus for the new products, including the BEV products.
If it is, would that be enough for the sort of longer-term sustainable growth and strategic positioning for the company? Thank you.

And that means more consumers understand more about electronic vehicles, vehicles.
What kind of change would that take for the users and also we know that could you please give us more color about Li X01 and then second question is about the BEV product that will be launched next year.

The first question is about our ecosystem strategy.
We noticed several start-up peers start we're planning to expand the operation go up into non-vehicle business.
For example like smartphone manufacturing, we're buying vehicles in order to broaden and enhance the user ecosystem of the smart TV.
So from Li Auto's perspective, how should we think about the company's ecosystem development? And my second question is about the cost management because we expect the general inflation or price hikes of the batteries and other team materials to continue this year.
So how should we wage the potential impact or any qualitative information we can take as a reference of, we'll assess the potential impact? Thank you.

Hello, everyone.
And thank you for joining our call today.
2021 was a pivotal year for new energy vehicle sales in China.
During this year, China's auto industry witnessed the notebook substitution of EVs for ICE, internal combustion engine vehicles, evidenced by Ev's rapid growth, in contrast to the sluggish sales trend of ICE vehicles.
This led to growing penetration of EVs in overall passenger vehicle sales.
According to China Passenger Car Association, in 2021, the retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles increased by 169% year over year to nearly 3 million.
Well, ICE vehicle retail sales decreased by 5.6%.
The penetration rate for retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles rose substantially to 20.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 versus 12.6% and 5.8% for the first nine months of 2021 and the full year of 2020.
With mobility transformation trend pointing to increase the smart electric vehicle use, we are proud to forge ahead as a pioneer.
As an industry leader, we are ready to serve more families with continuing product and technological innovations.
We achieved deliveries of 35,221 units in the fourth quarter of 2021 up 143.5% year over year.
Driving total revenue to RMB10.6 billion or $1.7 billion growing 156.1% year over year.
The robust fourth quarter performance took our full year deliveries to 90,491 up 177.4% year over year, and the total revenues to RMB27 billion or $4.1 billion, up 185.6% year over year.
Li ONE was the first domestic branded premium model priced above RMB300,000 in China to achieve the 10,000 monthly deliveries.
In January 2022, we have delivered over 10,000 Li ONEs for the third consecutive month, achieving a new record.
We believe this is another milestone for Li ONE to qualify as a blockbuster model and will be a benchmark for all our future models.
We are excited to Li ONE weekend, the premium passenger vehicle market in China, targeting family users and emerge as one of the best prices.
We attribute our vehicle success to our outstanding product definition capabilities.
The extended range six-seater SUV has gone from being questioned to mainstream.
While our full screen full vehicle interactive voice system has set a new industry benchmark.
This further proof our user's recognition of Li ONE pioneering and energy replenishment solution us adopting battery power for urban commuting, and the recharge with range extender during long distance traveling.
And highlights our users endorsement of the brand new in-vehicle driving and riding experience Li ONE offers in this autonomous era.
Our product definition capability are built on the shared vision in our organization and a solid foundation of comprehensive capability including technological strengths, performed consumer insights, and systematic execution.
And we are confident, we can apply this to our future models and continue to provide our users with solution beyond what they have demanded.
We aim to grow our model lineup significantly in the coming years.
Well, advancing our R&D efforts as product provides the competitiveness mode for business and technology for the most of our products.
Well, production and the delivery improved.
As most of our chief supply chain partners resumed normal operations challenges to the overall LED supply chain will likely become long lasting, affecting chips, batteries, and potential other auto parts given the accelerating development of the smart electric vehicle industry.
Going forward, together with our supply chain partners, we will continue to work on multiple measures such as advanced planning and diversify the supply chain to mitigate supply chain risk.
In light of the ongoing industry wide semiconductor shortage, we expect the total deliveries in the first quarter of 2022 to be between 30,000 to 32,000 vehicles.
Turning to the financial side, we maintained strong performance with a robust and the steady gross margin of 22.4% in the fourth quarter, growing 4.9% over -- year over year.
This was present by our strong vehicle sales performance and consistently effective cost management measurements.
Even as we accelerated the pace of R&D spending to 11.6% of revenue, and grew our sales network by adding 53 retail stores in the fourth quarter.
We achieved the profitability as well as a record-breaking RMB3.8 billion operating cash flow, which is a significant reflection of our operating team excellency.
In 2021, we significantly expanded our direct sales and servicing network, almost quadrupling our number of retail stores to 206 in 102 cities from 52 in 41 cities as of the end of 2020.
By the end of January, we had 220 retail stores in 105 cities, as well as 276 servicing centers, and Li AUTO authorized body and paint shops operating in 204 cities.
We aim to provide our users with more convenient, efficient, and pleasant purchasing and user experience by strengthening our online operations as well as continually adding physical platforms close to our users.
We plan to further enlarge our foot point and target reaching 400 retail stores by the end of this year to meet the growing market demand for NEV national wide supported by consumers rising NEV adoption and our upcoming new model launches in 2022 and award.
Moving to our product optimization and R&D efforts.
In December 2021, we released the OTA 3.0 update to all our Li ONE users, further enhancing the in-car experience for both drivers and passengers.
This upgrade include the Navigation on ADAS and Automatic Emergency Braking AEB features, making us the third automotive OEM globally to develop its own full stack NOA capability.
As of January 31, 2021, we have provided NOA to more than 70,000 family users.
And during the Spring Festival holiday, we accumulated over 2 million kilometers of NOA mileage with an ADAS-equipped user base at the leading scale in China.
We will continue to increase the R&D of ADAS-related technology, and we believe we are well-positioned to push the boundaries of assisted driving technologies.
The upgraded AEB with vision perception and everything enables Li ONE to identify roadworks and highway traffic accident sites, and prompt users in advance to avoid major accidents.
Li ONE was awarded 2021 Car of the Year by Li Xiang Tong Xue our rebound auto information platform in China, due to its outstanding AEB performance exhibited in the C-NCAP AEB test, known as the most strict vehicle testing in China by automotive professionals.
During the test Li ONE was the only assessed model in the final run, capable of accurately identifying crossing vehicles and two-wheelers.
This further reflects our full-stack sales development capabilities.
The OTA 3.0 update also included an upgraded version of the Li ONE smart in-car voice assistant.
Li Xiang Tong Xue, which now recognize this and executes more voice instructions for in-car entertainment, navigation, and the vehicle setting.
We will continue to conduct R&D to develop safer car with smarter product features that can be helpful for all members of the family.
Young and old, as we remain steadfast in our commitment to creating homes on the move that bring happiness to the entire family.
We are also happy to share that we have been added to the Hang Seng Tech Index under the indexes newly added category of autonomous technology.
The inclusion will take effect on March 7 this year.
We have also been included in the Hang Seng Composite Large Cap Index since August 2021.
As a technology leader in smart mobility, our addition to the Hang Seng Tech Index endorses the strength of our full stack self-developed ADAS and smart cabin technologies, as well as recognizes our capability to create value for our investors.
We look forward to bringing more families, our Li ONE premium experience that offers safer, simpler driving with all the amenities, and technology people want in a premium vehicle.
In the second quarter of 2022, we will unveil our next mass produced vehicle model.
A full-size premium extended-range electric SUV.
Deliveries of this model will start in the third quarter of this year.
In 2023, we plan to launch two BEV models that support ultrafast charging.
By then, our ultrahigh voltage charging solution will be readily available to our users, effectively shortening the charging time and addressing mileage anxiety.
As we remain committed to developing new models, autonomous driving, smart cockpit, and others.
Our R&D expense for 2021 tripled year over year to RMB3.3 billion or US$515.7 million accounting for 12.2% of revenue.
We will continue to expedite our R&D -- excuse me, R&D progress with the support of our extending R&D team, which is comprised of more than 3,400 personnel as of the end of 2021, representing 139.8% year-over-year growth, we target to maintain our R&D investments at the level of 10% of revenue and above going forward.
Turning to our production capacity, we're expanding our capacity at the Changzhou factory and constructing our Beijing manufacturing base.
Once the expansion and construction are completed, the design production capacity at these two manufacturing sites will reach 500,000 units annually in 2023, and around the 750,000 with double shift.
Meanwhile, we are excited to share that in December 2021, we entered into a Strategic Cooperation Framework with the Chongqing municipal government for establishing our new manufacturing base.
We will make relevant disclosure of the Chongqing manufacturing base when appropriate.
We enhance the production capacity together with our enriched product line will position us well to capture an increasing share of the booming EV market, laying a solid foundation for our strong growth in the years to come.
With the launch of our second major vehicle just around the corner and continued strength in order for our Li, we expect 2022 will be another pivotal year of growth for Li, for Li Auto.
Our pioneering spirit tells us to keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible and that's what we are doing.
The market is right for advancement, and we are in the right place at the right time with the right strategy, the right skill sets, the right business model, and the right vehicle to drive us to the next destination.
In 2022, we expect that the EV market to see its greatest number of drivers yet.
And we are all ready for it.
Now, I will turn this call over to our CFO, Mr.
Tie Li to review our financial performance in the fourth quarter.
"
3856,LI,2021,4,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,1,"Fei Fang, this is Kevin, let me take the second question about our preparation for the coming years.
Actually, we have a very strong confidence in our new products that we're going to launch in this year and next year.
Therefore, we are very, very aggressive in terms of getting our capacity prepared.
Right now, from the sales side, we -- as mentioned, we have a 400 store plan by end of this year.
We'll have more on next year.
And also not only a store, but also human resources of the sales force, we are also preparing.
From the capacity perspective actually, not only our own capacity, we are working with our supply chain partners to adding capacity in their factories also, and also as we should all know that the ICE supply is constrained.
So, therefore, we already started to secure upstream ICE resources by giving advanced planning to our supply chain partners.
Thank you.

Please ask your question.
"
3857,LI,2021,4,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,2,"Tim, this is Kevin, let me take the second question about the cost challenge.
In fact, when we plan for this year's financial budget, actually we already took into consideration of the potential cost increase, especially as we should all know that the battery is going to the cost will increase.
Yes, on the other hand, but actually with the volume substantially increased this year.
Also, we will achieve more economy of scale.
So, therefore, overall, we are -- although we have many challenges, but we are still targeting to achieve a higher margin gross margin than last year.

3858,LI,2021,4,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,3,"Hi, Lee.
This is Kevin, let me take the first question.
In fact, we are also impacted by the Bosch supply this month and also last month.
Not only the ICE shortage from SC but also the COVID-19 hit.
So going forward in the coming months actually we see the situation will getting improved by the fewer supply will be very tight.
So we'll continue to do what we have been doing.
First, qualify more supplies.
Second, give the vast extend into our supply chain partners.
Third, basically to increase our own production flexibility so that whenever the supply is available we can very quickly turn into final product to deliver to our customer.
Yes, second question?
"
3859,LI,2021,4,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,4,"Paul, let me take the second question about the globalization.
So basically, for our long-term strategy, we believe will ultimately compete in the global market, that's for sure.
And for the very near future, very near-term, we want to focus on the China market now.
And as I mentioned several times, we already have a dedicated team for the globalization strategy.
We are doing three things.
First, to identify the potential market for our product, second to analyze what we're doing the right product mix for this product, and the third, how to develop a model so that we can achieve meaningful market share when we enter this market.
So right now this team dedicated team is still developing the overall strategy.

Unknown speaker
First of all, this is Li Xiang.
I'm translating for Li Xiang.
I would like to answer this question as a product manager myself.
In fact, in the industry, there's a very established product logic.
We start with the users, the users care about two things, the first of all is their own needs.
And there are three levels of needs, starting with the first level, which is their superficial needs.
And then going down further, there's the hidden needs.
And eventually, their needs that the users don't even know themselves.
The first of all, we need to understand these needs very well.
And the second point is the price point that they're willing to buy our products at.
And with these things, we can basically draw a circle.
And as a product manager, our goal is to build products that will overlap as much as possible with this circle of user needs.
And the product really focuses on five different things.
The first one is product performance, we need to deliver a product that performs well on many different levels.
And secondly, is safety and security.
Third is quality.
Fourth is price.
And fifth is supply, especially in an industry that's been growing so rapidly.
Supply is especially important, as has been seen in the industry in the past few years.
So overall, if we can build a product that can balance these five factors and match with the circle of user needs, then the bigger the overlap, the greater the sales.
And on the contrary, if the overlap is very small, no matter what the vision is, from the company standpoint, sales will always suffer.
So we believe a good product, a good product performance is never a coincidence.
It's based on very established and solid product capabilities of the company.
Thank you.

3862,LI,2021,4,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,1,"[Foreign language]
Unknown speaker
As the founder of the company, we have been focused from day one on the smart electric vehicle market.
And we believe that we've just finished our zero to one stage.
And there's still way too many things for us to focus on, then to expand into other sectors.
So there are many things that we can do on the product application technology and system levels that I believe will take the next five to 10 years for us to complete.
And we will very -- be very focused on this market going forward for at least the next 10 years.
And we believe that in 10 years, we can reach the level of where Apple is in smartphones and smart devices.
So that's our overall strategy.
And then speaking about space, in-car space, there are so many things to do.
We're not talking about expanding into other types of space.
Because we believe that even for the space in car, there's still many things to do.
One of the opportunities is, the experience is for activities where the experience is still not as perfect in other space, we believe there's an opportunity to move them into cars.
And because of our integration capabilities, and because we can fully control many of the hardware and software, we can provide much better experience and they are the way it is elsewhere, including content and hardware.
These are all big opportunities to tackle that we will continue to focus on in the foreseeable future.

And our goal has always been to deliver good experience for the customers.
And there's actually large amounts of work for us to deliver this good experience including adapting HD map and continue to fine-tune.
So we will continue this work to continue to improve -- make improvements and safety.
And our goal is to increase safety standards across the entire driving experience, not just when the car is in NOA mode.
So which is the reason why we started to develop many of the technologies in-house.
And our ultimate goal is to increase safety by decreasing accidents by 80% across the entire lifecycle of our vehicles, which is why we make the feature standard and continue to iterate the feature over time.
So the above is about the current solution on our Li ONE which runs on two horizons J3 chips.
And speaking of X01, which will be launched this year, there will be significant improvements not only in sensors but also in computing power and safety redundancies.
It will bring the safety of entire vehicle over the lifecycle to a whole new level.
And it will make the drivers in their family safe not only when the car is in NOA mode, but also when the drivers driving themselves.

By the end of 2021, we've pretty much validated ourselves and finished the completed the zero to one stage as a company, we've been focusing on, we've been validating ourselves in the family youth buyers' market, and pretty much established the industry ceiling as the number one seller in the medium to large size SUV market.
And our key recipe for this success is our focus on the family market, our efficiency, our R&D capabilities, and our software R&D capabilities.
This is validated through sales and having while having a very low SG&A expense level.
And in the next couple years, while we completed our one to 10 stages, as many of you are well aware of 2025 goals in volume and margins.
And so to reach this goal, we will continue to play to our strengths, which is two things, one is we will -- we understand the family market very well and we will expand our product line across the 200,000 to 500,000 price range by providing our products to more families in more segments and markets.
The second one is our efficiency and R&D capabilities.
As you can see, our R&D and new store opening pace has been on par with many of our competitors.
But in the meantime, we're still delivering very healthy and profitable financial results.
In the meantime, which we admit we have many weaknesses, which is what we will be working on over the next few years.
First of all is R&D, we actually have already made many improvements, we brought in our autonomous driving and voice recognition in-house by building a very strong talented team.
In meantime, we've established our new capabilities in zonal controllers, like E-architecture, all of these are brought in-house today.
So we believe that we will continue to build these R&D capabilities in the technical area.
In the meantime, the other weakness has been supply or area we want to work on is supply given the growth in the market, we'll be working on supply and as well as manufacturing capabilities.
And finally, on the topic of intelligent technologies, we believe that there's no shortcut in the market.
One thing we've observed with intelligent technology is that it has three characteristics.
First of all, users have no particular feeling of the technology when they buy the product.
And secondly, if that experience is bad after they buy the product, they will very easily give up the product and lose all their confidence.
And thirdly, if the product is actually good, they will very quickly find out that they cannot live without the product.
So to make sure that we can deliver competitive products in the Intelligent technology area, we will focus on three capabilities which we have, we believe the company is very well established.
And first of all is the product capability.
It's very important to understand the user needs and continue to deliver products that will exceed their needs.
And second one is software and AI capabilities, which ultimately is the competition on talent, the bench of talent.
We believe the most successful companies are the ones that can attract the best talents are the ones where the best talents will like most prefer to work in.
And third one is face system capability.
And more specifically, the ability to develop operating systems, and we believe with these three abilities, we will be able to maintain our core competency in both autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit.
Thank you.

First of all, on the first question, as we reach higher penetration, new energy vehicle market is actually good news for the company, the same product methodology will continue to apply.
And as I said earlier, we have deserved our users, there are three levels of demand, the first level are the explicit demand, the second level are the implicit demand, many, which are their pain points.
And the third level demands that they don't even know exists.
The way we observe these demands is that we analyze and observe the users on rational and emotional levels and understand what they want, and build products that will exceed their needs.
And talk about the X01, our core theme has been two things, one thing is to upgrade things that users really wanted on the one and wanting to ask to their Li ONE product.
And secondly, we're delivering on new demand that are not yet or not yet met in the market today.
These are things that users do not even realize that they want, but the moment that they see their products, they'll realize this is what I actually wanted.
So the methodology will continue to remain the way it is, although the user needs are changing, and we will continue to follow that very closely.
So these are some comments on our next new vehicle on our range-extended vehicle -- range-extended vehicle platform.
Next, I'll make a few comments on the electric vehicle market, electric vehicle product.
So the electric vehicle we will focus on three different things.
First of all is 4C charging capability.
And this most important component will be the battery, we've actually spent a lot of efforts to co-develop a battery with our key supplier because the entire architecture and cell and charging capability, heat management system will all be different.
So we've done intensive, extensive work in this area to ensure that the mass production of this battery will be successful.
The second component of our high voltage platform is the 850 volt EV platform, which includes many different things ranging from electric motors, integrating PCBC of rising voltage, lowering voltage, heat management, battery management system, all these things have never been provided before as a company and the third thing is a 400-kilowatt charging station and charging poles.
We've done a lot of work to develop these charging poles to ensure that we can provide seamless experience for our users which connects the battery, the vehicle platform, and the charging station.
With these products, we will be able to charge the cars in 10 minutes and deliver 400 kilometers of range.

Please ask your question.

3866,LI,2021,4,xiang-li,founder-and-chief-executive-officer,False,5,"[Foreign language]
Unknown speaker
So the answer is yes.
We will continue to focus on this market because we pretty much only validate ourselves at one particular price point in this market.
But if you look at the entire market, we define the Li ONE product in 2016, the market size is only about two million units annually.
And last year, the market has grown to six million, and we expect that by 2025, the market size will reach 10 million units per year.
So this is a very healthy market for three reasons.
One is it has very big growth as we talked about earlier.
And second one is that there's enough or bill of materials in the market for us to deliver good experience for the users.
And thirdly, it can still deliver very healthy gross margin for us as a company.
So we believe this is a very attractive market that we'll continue to focus on.
So far, we've only really taken a very small scoop from the market accounting for about 2% market share in the market.
Here we're talking about all passenger vehicle market, not just NEV because we believe Li ONE not only competes with new energy vehicles, but we have the potential to replace all existing passenger vehicles above RMB200,000 price points.
So there's still much work to do and our goal is to eventually reach at least 20% of the market, which is the time by which we will have finished our one to 10 stage as a company.

Hello, everyone.
I will now walk you through some of our financial results for the third quarter of 2021.
Due to time constraints, I will address the financial highlights here and encourage you to refer to our earnings press release for further details.
Total revenue in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB 7.78 billion or USD 1.21 billion, representing an increase of 209.7% from RMB 2.51 billion in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 54.3% from RMB 5.04 billion in the second quarter of this year.
This included RMB 7.39 billion or USD 1.15 billion from vehicle sales, which increased 199.7% year over year and 50.6% quarter over quarter.
The increase in revenue from vehicle sales from the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 was mainly attributable to the increase of vehicle delivery in the third quarter of 2021.
Revenues from other sales and services were RMB 389.4 million or USD 60.4 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of 745.1% year over year and an increase of 187% quarter over quarter.
The increase in revenue from other sales and services over the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 was mainly attributable to the sales of regulatory credits as well as increased sales of charging stalls, accessories, and services, in line with our higher accumulated vehicle sales.
Cost of sales in the third quarter of 2021 was RMB 5.96 billion or RMB 925.5 million, representing an increase of 196.1% year over year and an increase of 45.9% quarter over quarter.

Vehicle margin in the third quarter was 21.1% compared with 19.8% in the third quarter of 2020 and 18.7% in the second quarter of 2021.
The increase in vehicle margin was primarily driven by higher average selling price attributable to increasing deliveries of 2021 Li ONE in the third quarter of 2021.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 23.3% compared with 19.8% in the third quarter of 2020 and 18.9% in the second quarter of this year, mainly driven by the increase in vehicle margin.
Operating expenses in the third quarter were RMB 1.91 billion or USD 296.4 million, representing an increase of 182.2% year over year and an increase of 28.3% quarter over quarter.
R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB 888.5 million or USD 137.9 million, representing an increase of 165.6% year over year and an increase of 36% quarter over quarter.
The increase in R&D expenses over the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of this year was primarily attributable to increased employee compensation as a result of growing research and development staff as well as increased costs associated with new product developments.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter were RMB 1.02 billion or USD 158.5 million, representing an increase of 198.5 year over year and increase of 22.3% quarter over quarter.
The increase in SG&A expenses over the third quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by increased marketing and promotion activities as well as increased employee compensation and rental expenses associated with the expansion of the company's distribution network.
The increase in SG&A expenses over the second quarter of this year was primarily driven by the increased employee compensation and rental expenses, associated with the expansion of the company's distribution network.
Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2021 was RMB 97.8 million or USD 15.2 million, representing a decrease of 45.7% year over year and a decrease of 81.8% quarter over quarter.
Net loss in the third quarter of 2021 was RMB 21.5 million or USD 3.3 million, representing a decrease of 79.9% year over year and a decrease of 90.9% quarter over quarter.
And turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our bank cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, term deposits, and short-term investments totaled RMB 48.83 billion or USD 7.58 billion as of September 30, 2021.
Operating cash flow in the third quarter of 2021 was RMB 2.17 billion or USD 336.7 million.
Free cash flow was RMB 1.16 billion or USD 180.8 million in the third quarter.
And now for our business outlook.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, the company expects the deliveries to be between 30,000 and 32,000 vehicles, representing an increase of 107.4% to 121.2% from the fourth quarter of 2020.
The company also expects fourth quarter total revenues to between RMB 8.82 billion and RMB 7.41 billion or USD 1.37 billion and USD 1.46 billion, representing an increase of 112.7% to 126.9% from the fourth quarter of 2020.
This business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary view on its business situation and market condition, in particular, the ongoing industrywide semiconductor shortage, which are all subject to change.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to start our Q&A session.
Thank you.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs.
Please ask your question.
"
3876,LI,2021,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-executive-officer,False,1,"Hi, Tim.
This is Johnny.
I think the current gross margin is, as we guided before, it was mainly due to the higher average selling price of the new 2021 Li ONE, and also, the cost control effort of our internal team, supply chain team, despite the semiconductor shortage.
On this year's cost margin, we still want to keep our previous guidance.
For the promotion, currently, the customer has about six to eight weeks of waiting time, so no need to do more promotion to let the customer wait too long, yes.
So, currently, at least in the next two to three months, we won't do that.
"
3877,LI,2021,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-executive-officer,False,2,"I will take the first question.
I think due to the current supply chain shortage, I think it is not the right time to give guidance for the next year.
But you should believe, within the company, we have a very robust plan for the next year.
Maybe Kevin could take the second question.
"
3878,LI,2021,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-executive-officer,False,3,"Yes.
Also, I think we are less impacted as we do EREV.
They have one less battery pack.

Your next question comes from the line of Ming-Hsun Lee of BofA Securities.
Please ask your question.
"
3880,LI,2021,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-executive-officer,False,5,"I will take the second question first.
This is Johnny.
I think we have already sold off all the EV credit beginning from last year's sales.
So, basically, around RMB200 million, with all the EV credit over 70 for last year.
So we won't have a lot more revenue for the fourth quarter.
For the first question, I will pass to Kai.
"
3881,LI,2021,3,johnny-tie-li,chief-executive-officer,False,6,"This is Johnny.
I think, generally, we still target to achieve our desired gross margin on the Li ONE.
As we mentioned before, it will be finally to achieve a 25% as we design the product.
But currently, we are under pressure of the supply chain cost pressure, and it's a floor that we expected last year.
So it's a mix of our supply chain effort and also those measures from the semiconductor parts.
Also, we have -- there's a lot of increase we have some benefit from the manufacturing side, so it's a net-net impact for each quarter.

3883,LI,2021,3,paul-gong,ubs,True,0,"Thanks for taking my questions.
Basically, there are two questions.
The first one is regarding your order pipeline.
We have observed that in this rising competition environment, some peers have already accelerated new products launch or adding new models or more models into the pipeline.
How does Li Auto consider your action on this? [Foreign language]
"
3884,LI,2021,3,paul-gong,ubs,True,1,"OK.
My second question is regarding the ADAS going forward.
It seems that now that the different ADAS systems by different car makers are getting a little bit similar to each other.
Everyone would adopt LIDAR, everyone would use Nvidia chips with high calculation power.
What is the key differentiation in this competition in the ADAS function going forward, for the relatively longer time? [Foreign language]

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
We are excited to be part of this once-in-a-century transformation from ICE vehicles to smart electric vehicles.
We are also pleased to see user acceptance of the EVs reaching an inflection point.
As reported by the China Passenger Car Association, the penetration rate of EVs in retail sales rose significantly to 18.5% in October from 5.8% in 2020.
Looking out to 2022, we believe the extended range system with a large battery capacity will usher in a year of explosive EREV sales.
Against this backdrop and on the heels of the successful 2021 Li ONE launch in May, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, achieving revenue growth of 209.7% year over year, underpinned by record-breaking quarterly delivery of 25,116 units, an increase of 190% year over year.
This growth once again highlights the underlying strength of our 2021 Li ONE and its compelling appeal to family users.
Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our team and supply chain partners as well as continuous support from Li ONE users.
Our October deliveries was 7,649 units increasing 107.2% year over year.
Our order intake remains robust, hitting a new monthly record of over 14,500 units in October.
The rapid development of the smart EV industry has magnified the effects of the industrywide chip shortage, challenging each OEM's production and delivery schedule.
While we are enjoying the strong user endorsement of our product.
Our delivery growth lagged our order growth due to the chip supply shortage, which has constrained our production.
Despite the lingering impact of COVID-19 and extreme weather conditions in certain regions, we have resolved some of the chip supply problems by working diligently with our supply partners and also internal teams.
We delivered the 100,000 Li ONE to our family users in this month and expect our deliveries in November to exceed 10,000 vehicles.
In light of the ongoing industrywide semiconductor shortage, we expect the total delivery in the fourth quarter of 2021 to be between 30,000 to 32,000 vehicles.
As the development of the smart electric vehicle industry accelerate, we think the challenge to the overall EV supply chain facing the industry will persist into the future.
Going forward, we will continue to take actions and find multiple measures together with our supply chain partners to mitigate the risk.
Turning to the profitability.
Our gross margin stood at 23.3% in the third quarter, up 3.5% year over year and 4.4% quarter over quarter.
Our operating cash flow was RMB 2.17 billion or USD 336.7 million during the third quarter, reflecting our consistent and relentless focus on execution and cost management.
During the third quarter, we made notable progress in the expansion of our direct sales and service network, which not only serves as our user touch point for efficient sales and marketing, but also an integral component of our closed-loop integrated online and offline platform that help us manage user feedback to continuously enhance our products and services.
As of October 31, 2021, we had 162 retail stores, covering 86 cities and the 223 servicing center and the Li Auto authorized body and paint shops operating in 165 cities.
We will continue to expand our coverage of lower-tier cities while deepening our penetration in first and the second tier cities to reach our target of 200 retail stores by year end, covering more than 100 cities in China.
This will increase our brand awareness and prepare us for surging user demand as we launch new models.
In terms of product optimization, we upgraded the in-car invoice assistant Li Xiang Tong Xue and launched a new application store via an OTA update in early September.
The new Li Xiang Tong Xue is smarter and able to carry out smoother and more natural conversations.
Li Xiang Tong Xue can also take separate commands from four different zooms in the car, providing full coverage in-car voice control and creating a more fun and entertaining experience for families.
The new application store offers a streamlined interactive design, supporting an application ecosystem similar to that on smartphones, allowing users to upgrade their in-car application without the need of an OTA update.
With these upgrades, our Li ONE continues to evolve and grow.
Meanwhile, we plan to release our NOA upgrade to 2021 Li ONE users in December.
We are confident that 2021 Li ONE with NOA functions will provide family users with safe, enhanced, convenience and effective ADAS functions.
Following the NOA upgrade through OTA, all 2021 Li ONE will be equipped with this feature.
We are prepared to provide NOA to over 60,000 family users by year-end, gaining a dominant leadership in this regard in China.
In terms of HPC BEV, we are making good progress developing our technologies to support high-power charging.
We have completed the 4C battery pack test on vehicles and demonstrated that it can support a driving range of more than 400 kilometers with only 10 minutes charging.
With the proceeds raised through our due primary listing, we will build upon our recent success and to deploy R&D capital to drive parallel development in EREVs and BEVs, and advancement in smart cockpit and ADAS technologies, aiming to introduce more product catering to family users' needs, and competing with both ICE vehicles and the electric vehicles.
We also made headway in expanding our production capacity.
In October, we officially commenced the construction of our manufacturing base in Beijing.
The manufacturing base is scheduled to be operational in 2023 and will serve as an important production base for our premium BEVs.
Now I will turn this call over to our CFO, Mr.
Tie Li to review our financial performance in the third quarter.

To your first question, for HPC, besides the 4C battery we made good progress.
On the other hand, we also made a lot of progress on our high-voltage air-conditioning system, also the progress made on the high-power charging infrastructure.
So in terms of timing, we're still on track to launch our first HPC BEV product in the second half of 2023.
And in terms of our production plan, actually, right now, our factory ramp-up already can support roughly 14,000 per month.
Right now, our production is gated by the chip shortage.

But so far, within this year, we have no plan to increase the price with [Inaudible].
"
3904,LI,2021,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,5,"Paul, this is Kevin.
In terms of our future product, actually, we will reveal our X01 to the market in the second quarter next year and start to deliver in the third quarter.
More details of the X01 will be introduced at the launch event.
Although we see a lot of new products launching to the market, we want to still keep to our own schedule.
Right now, for example, when our Li ONE delivered the volume reached the level of Highlanders, its residential value is also getting close to the Highlander level.
This is the benefit of reaching scale by a single model.
We will choose to sell big volumes with one model rather than very quickly launch a lot of models, but only sell small volumes.
Our philosophy is slightly different than our peers. 
"
3905,LI,2021,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,6,"This is Kevin.
I will translate.
Mr.
Li Xiang just made some comments on the gross margin.
Our philosophy is a healthy gross margin is very important for us, especially considering how we are a technology company.
If we look at some of the previous generation technology companies, they have a very thin gross margin therefore they cannot invest enough money on the R&D.
Most of their R&D money is spent on the product development, not enough in the technology development.
So our thinking is that we want to keep a very healthy gross margin so that not only we can invest in the product development, but also, we will invest more and more on the technology development, 10% on the technology R&D.
"
3906,LI,2021,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,7,"This is Kevin.
Right now, we are on track to achieve 200 retail stores by the year end to cover around 150 within China.
Next year, our initial plan is to at least double the number of retail stores.
"
3907,LI,2021,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,8,"Thank you, Jeff.
This is Kevin.
First question, October delivery was impacted by both the Bosch ESP supply and also the millimeter radar supply.
That's why you see that our order intake is around double the number of the final delivery.
This month, actually, the millimeter radar supply shortage has been solved.
The only constraint we have is from Bosch, so therefore the order intake will not be 200% of the delivery.
Your second question, actually, right now, the headlight we have is in the first quarter of next year, we will still continue to be constrained by this Bosch ESP component.
Right now, we are working with Bosch to try to solve as much as possible.

Please ask your question.
"
3909,LI,2021,3,kevin-yanan-shen,president,False,10,"Thank you, Lou Jia.
This is Kevin.
First of all, for the SG&A, the highlight I can give to you is that for the immediate next step, our plan is to control SG&A to a 10% level and for the longer term, we plan to -- especially with the volume growth, we plan to further decrease this percentage.
So this year, you see a slight increase on the SG&A, is because, on one hand, the promotion and also especially the aggressive sales network expansion increased our SG&A percentage.
In terms of our capacity, by the end of 2023 our plan is to reach a standard capacity of annual capacity 500,000.
And with double shift, actually, we can do the total capacity near 700,000 units.
That's our plan for 2023.

Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the great result.
My first question is regarding cost, because we see that the cost per vehicle rises to RMB 232,000 in the third quarter, which is RMB5000 more than the second quarter, and also it's the highest quarter since 2020.
Could you share the reason with us, maybe how much is caused by the rising cost of 2021 model, and how much is caused by the rising price of material? [Foreign language]

Very impressive quarter.
My first question is on your HPC BEV pipeline.
Other than the 4C battery pack test that Changzhou have shared on the call, which is obviously very impressive, what else have you thought about in terms of the key features that differentiate your upcoming product from this competitive market? Also, can you refresh us the timeline for your next product launch? The second question is about production hurdles.
The management mentioned that, if I heard you correctly, in October there was 14,500 units of intake in terms of the backlog expansion.
So if you look at next year, when do you think the monthly production can ramp up toward that level? Thank you.

3926,LI,2021,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,0,"This is Kai speaking.
So regarding your first question, so our NOA feature will be released in December, and so far, we have lots of testing, over a million kilometers.
Since our 2021 Li ONE model has NOA feature by default, which makes our December OTA update the biggest NOA release in scale in China.
So I think this is probably the biggest difference compared with our peers.
Thank you.
"
3927,LI,2021,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,1,"This is Kai speaking.
Regarding this ADAS related topic, we believe ADAS technology eventually I think user experience is the most important thing.
But in order to achieve automated user experience, as in the previous quarter, we already explained, you need massive data to train your algorithm to make it more intelligent.
As you know, Li Auto, we have the biggest, basically, customer base with NOA feature by default because we believe safety is very important to every single of our customers.
Therefore, by using the complete fleet, we can speed up our progress of our development to make the user experience reach much, let's say, faster speed than our competitors.
Thank you.

I've got two questions.
No.
1, about long-term borrowing.
So we told that in the second quarter, our long-term borrowing actually go to RMB 5.6 billion.
Given you have some of the cash on hand, can you explain why that perhaps we have a big jump in the end of June? That's number one question.
No.
2 is about the volume guidance.
It actually used to be kind of our September number can go to 10,000.
But if you see the third quarter guidance, it seems like if we maintain the 10,000 guidance for September, we mind that August should be a very low number.
So how should we think about the third quarter guidance? And we also actually guided 1.6 million units by 2025, in prior to maybe next year, talk about 150,000 units.
So during next year, 2022, the volume should be 150,000.

I'm not sure if this is my line.
This is Paul Gong with UBS.
I have two questions.
The first one is regarding your split of the BEV versus EREV in terms of positioning.
Starting from 2023, you will have both.
How do you position the different segments and the size of each segment? And how should we think -- is this going to be the EREV is more focused on the larger vehicle or SUV, NPV, etc., and the BEV is more focused on the smaller vehicle next to sedans, etc.
How should we think about positioning of the BEV versus EREV? My second question is regarding your R&D spend in split going forward? For second half of this year, from next year and going forward, how much portion is going to be spent on the BEV? How much on the EREV? And how much on the autonomous driving? Let me translate my questions quickly.

Hello, everyone.
I will now walk you through some of our financial results for the second quarter of 2021.
Due to the time constraint, I will address financial highlights here and encourage you to refer to our earnings press release for further details .Total revenues in the second quarter of 2021 were RMB 5.04 billion or USD 780.4 million, representing an increase of 40.7% from RMB 3.58 billion in the first quarter of 2021.
This included RMB 4.9 billion or USD 759.4 million from vehicle sales, which increased 41.6% quarter over quarter.
This increase in vehicle sales was mainly driven by the increase in delivery of the 2021 Li ONE since its release on May 25, 2021.
Revenues from other sales and services were RMB 135.7 million or USD 21 million in the second quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 21.7% quarter over quarter.
The increase in revenue from other sales and services over the first quarter was mainly due to the increased sales of charging stalls, accessories and services in line with higher accumulated vehicle sales.
Cost of sales in the second quarter was RMB 4.09 billion or USD 632.9 million, representing an increase of 38.2% quarter over quarter.
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2021 was RMB 952.8 million or USD 147.6 million, growing 54.5% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
Vehicle margin in the second quarter was 18.7% compared with 16.9% in the first quarter of 2021.
The increase in vehicle margin from the first quarter was primarily driven by higher average selling price in the second quarter of 2021 due to our launch of 2021 Li ONE in late May.
Our gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 18.9% compared to 17.3% in the first quarter of 2021, which was mainly attributable to the increase of vehicle margins.
Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021 were RMB 1.49 billion or USD 230.6 million, representing an increase of 45.3% quarter over quarter.
Research and development expenses in the second quarter of 2021 were RMB 653.4 million or USD 101.2 million, representing an increase of 27% quarter over quarter.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses were RMB 543.7 million or USD 84.2 million, increasing 36.6% quarter over quarter.
The increase in research and development expenses over the first quarter of 2021 was primarily attributable to the increased headcount and the increased research and development activities for the company's future vehicle models.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2021 were RMB 835.3 million or USD 129.4 million, representing an increase of 63.8% quarter over quarter.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB 780.9 million or USD 129.9 million, increasing 73.6% quarter over quarter.
The increase over the first quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by increased marketing and promotion activities as well as increased headcount and rental expenses with the expansion of the company's distribution network.
Loss from operations in the second quarter of 2021 was RMB 535.9 million or USD 83 million, representing an increase of 31.4% compared with the first quarter.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, the non-GAAP loss from operations was RMB 365.5 million or USD 56.6 million, representing an increase of 62.6% quarter over quarter.
Net loss was RMB 235.5 million or USD 36.5 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared with RMB 360 million net loss in the first quarter of 2021.
Non-GAAP net loss was RMB 65.1 million or USD 10.1 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared with RMB 177 million net loss in the first quarter of 2021.
Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits and short-term investments totaled RMB 36.53 billion or USD 5.66 billion as of June 30, 2021.
Operating cash flow in the second quarter of 2021 was RMB 1.41 billion or USD 218 million.
Free cash flow was RMB 982.1 million or USD 152.1 million in the second quarter.
And now for our business outlook.
For the third quarter of 2021, the company expects deliveries to be between 25,000 and 26,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 188.7% to 200.2% from the third quarter of 2022.
The company also expects the third quarter total revenue to be between RMB 6.98 billion and RMB 7.25 billion or USD 1.08 billion and USD 1.12 billion, representing an increase of 177.8% to 188.9% from the third quarter of 2022.
This business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, in particular the ongoing industrywide semiconductor shortage due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which are all subject to change.
I will now turn the call to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session.
Thank you.

So how can we manage the supply disruption better than our peers? Is there any alternative sources Li Auto could secure the component and the support likely more than 12,000 monthly run rate into fourth quarter? So this is the first question about the supply.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
First of all, we are proud that our Class A ordinary shares started trading on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 12, opening a new chapter for our company.
We are honored and also humbled by the support we received from all investors.
With the Hong Kong dual primary listing, we significantly strengthened our equity base with over USD 1.5 billion of net proceeds raised.
This will provide strong financial support for our R&D initiatives and the direct sales and servicing network expansion as well as enhanced protection for our shareholders.
We will continue to take the responsibilities associated with being a publicly traded company seriously, work to build out our long-term vision and create value for our users, shareholders and our employees alike.
Next, moving to the key highlights of our second-quarter results.
Our 2021 Li ONE has been an exceptional performer since its debut on May 25.
Our 2021 Li ONE boost and enhanced the ADC range of 1,080 kilometers, optimized the mobility comfort and more intelligent cockpit.
It has received rave reviews and strong user endorsement for its outstanding features and performance.
Our second-quarter deliveries achieved 17,575 units, increasing 166% year over year.
Our July deliveries reached 8,589 hitting a new record.
In July, Li ONE topped sales chart in the new energy SUV and large SUV categories.
according to new car insurance registration data reported by China Automotive Technology and Research Center.
It is a powerful testament to Li ONE's highly competitive product features, making us a leading domestic NEV manufacturer in China.
While these rankings and Li ONE's strong performance and popularity are exciting achievements, yesterday's home run do not win today's game.
We will continue to be disciplined and dedicated, and we will strive to constantly surpass ourselves in products and services to earn the support, trust and loyalty from our users.
Our record high deliveries would not have been possible without cooperation and assistance of our supply chain partners.
They have been helping us navigate the ongoing semiconductor shortage.
Turning to the profitability.
Our gross margin reached 18.9% this quarter, up 5.6 percentage points year over year and 1.6% quarter over quarter.
Our operating cash flow was RMB 1.4 billion or USD 218 million during the second quarter, demonstrating our consistent high operating capability.
In the second quarter, we aim to further broaden and deepen city coverage to address increasing demand from prospective users across China and prepare ourselves for our new model launches in 2022 and beyond.
Thus, we accelerated the expansion of our direct sales and servicing network.
As of July 31, 2021, we had 109 retail stores covering 67 cities and 176 servicing centers, and Li Auto authorized body and paint shops operating in 134 cities.
We are on track to reach our year-end target of 200 retail stores.
We have expanded our footprint to lower tier cities in China.
In August, we opened a retail store in Lhasa, Tibet.
This has taken our direct sales and servicing network geographical coverage of provinces, autonomous regions and centrally administered municipalities in Mainland China to 100%.
The industrywide semiconductor shortage has affected our monthly deliveries in recent months, resulting in undelivered backlog as our new orders exceeded 10,000 in June.
We tried our best to utilize our alternative solutions to enhance our flexibility and acquire industry sources.
Going forward, we'll continue to collaborate closely with our supply chain partners to mitigate the semiconductor shortage and minimize the impact on our production.
Given the proven success of our Li ONE catering to the needs of families, we are working to diversify our product portfolio to appeal to an even broader family user base.
We have three platforms under development.
The X platform for our next-generation EREV with the first model to be released in 2022, and the Whale and the Shark platform for our BEV models to be launched in 2023.
The development of these new platforms are progressing smoothly, and we are confident to launch new vehicle model some time.
In July, we also signed an MOU with a local company for collaboration in reconstruction and expansion project of an automobile manufacturing plant in Beijing.
This will further expand our production capacity and support the increasing vehicle sales volume with future models.
On August 27, 2021, we also signed an investment agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Xinchen China Power Holdings Limited to form a new company in Mianyang, Sichuan Province, China to develop and manufacture our next-generation range extension system.
We firmly believe that smart EREVs will be a superior replacement to ICE vehicles and they increase the overall NEV penetration rate in the medium to long term.
We continue to view it as one of our core strategic development directions.
The cooperation will leverage the R&D and the production capabilities of both companies to provide high-quality products and further expand the market share of smart EREVs in the domestic market.
With respect to international markets, we will keep our strategy to always make sense before taking actions as we want to be a winner, not just a mere participant in the global market.
To win market share overseas, a car company has to develop the right product to attract customer with tastes and requirements that are different from domestic customers.
We have set up a team dedicated to the overseas market, and we are meticulously working on the plans to find a winning formula.
As a corporate citizen, we are proud to have passionately engaged in social relief activities to help people in need.
In July, in response to the flood in Henan Province, we organized the emergency relief with donations to support the affected people, including our users.
We also mobilized all traders we have access in the adjacent provinces to join the rescue efforts.
In addition, we provide our users with services such as warranty extension for replacement parts, free replacement of flood damage charging posts and free vehicle inspections for our disaster stricken vehicles.
We made our efforts to reassure them and help in any way possible for a smooth transition back to normalcy.
Lastly, we achieved a AA MSCI ESG rating in April, making us a leader in ESG among 40 rated automotive companies.
Going forward, we will continue to undertake social responsibilities and view this as an integral part of our mission to build smart electric vehicles that make families happier.
Now I will turn this call over to our CFO, Mr.
Tie Li, to review our financial performance in the second quarter.
"
3956,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,1,"Fang Fei, this is Kevin.
Thank you for the question.
Yes.
I think for the product development cycle, we have our own strategy and scheduled to launch new products.
So basically, we are accelerating our development, our next generation of EREV platform and also the HPC BEV platform.
As we shared before, we will roll out our brand-new EREV models based on our next-generation EREV platform next year, and 2023 will have -- will be a big year for us.
We'll have two new models on the X platform and another two HPC BEV model launch.
And for the regulation, in fact, we have been closely communicating and engaging with the authorities.
I think the intention from the MIIT is to standardize the overall smart electric vehicle industry and the risk of the technology requirement for the ADAS solution.
I think overall, this is a good thing.
This will ensure the healthy development of this industry.
And I think the impact to us is basically in the future, we need to be more cautious when we launch the product with ADAS solution.
I think it will take us more effort to fully develop a function before the launch into the market.
But that was our original plan.
So there is no change of our strategy.
But overall, I think our focus on ADAS will not change.
"
3957,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,2,"Thank you, Tim.
This is Kevin.
I will answer the first question about the shortage.
Right now, the single big shortage we are facing is an industry common shortage due to the COVID-19 situation in Malaysia, especially from ST.
So this is an industry common shortage.
And in the past several months, we have been fighting every day for the supply.
I don't think we -- our situation is better than the other competitors, yes.
But the outlook for the next quarter, if the COVID-19 situation will get better, we believe overall the industry supply will become more balanced.
But the COVID-19 situation is not predictable.
So it's still a risk for us.
Johnny, do you want to comment on that?
"
3958,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,3,"Lee, thank you.
This is Kevin.
Very quickly, your first question besides the sales price increase of the new Li ONE from the cost perspective, primarily we had -- partially due to the BOM cost reduction from some of our suppliers, and also because of the sales volume increase, therefore, the amortization will reduce.
So that's the -- that result in the gross margin increase.
I think for the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we'll continue to see the gross margin will gradually improve also.
So we still see that overall, for this year, blended gross margin will be somewhere between 19% to 20%.
The second, your second question is about our joint venture with Xinchen Holdings.
Actually, Xinchen Holdings is a leading engine company in China, especially they have been a long-term partner with BMW.
So we have this joint venture, jointly R&D developer and manufacturer our next-generation EREV engine with Xinchen.
And for this joint venture, we have 51% of the share.
"
3959,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,4,"Thank you.
Operator
Thank you.
Our next question is from the line of Bin Wang of Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
Please go ahead. 
"
3960,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,5,"Yeah, yeah.
This is Kevin.
Thank you, Wang, Bin, for the question.
I think when we give out the guidance for third quarter, we have already taken into consideration of the potential risk of the impact of the COVID-19 in Malaysia.
So therefore, we don't want to be too aggressive.
So I think today is already 30th.
So in the next two days, you will see our August numbers.
And for the next year, I think your estimation is within the range of our plan.
We -- of course, we want to further increase the monthly delivery of Li ONE.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Chang Liu of CICC.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open. 
"
3961,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,6,"This is Kevin.
For the HPC BEV models, we are on track in terms of our R&D process.
To share some of the milestones, for example, we already have our 4C new battery sample ready.
So that's a big milestone.
And also for our HPC super-fast charging port design, we have already finished the concept design, and we plan to have our first pilot charging station within this year.
"
3962,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,7,"Paul, yes.
Let me take the first question.
This is Kevin.
So in the future, when we have a BEV and the EREV at the same time, actually, we are not differentiating these two based on size and -- based on size of car form factor.
So basically, all these two driving powertrain will based on this developed cars to cover the price band from RMB 200,000 to RMB 500,000, and they will -- each will have a different size of cars, design for family users.
I think the key difference between these two are based on the customer's preference.
If they are more concerned about the BEVs range anxiety and they don't have access to good charging infrastructure, they will choose -- we believe they will choose EREV, yes.
If they have a good charging infrastructure, they will choose BEV.
So that's our viewpoint.
"
3963,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,8,"Yingbo, this is Kevin.
Yes.
First of all, about the pricing, from our point of view, for each of the products we design based on a price point.
And unless we see the competitive issue, otherwise, we'll not alter the price point of this product.
I think to answer your question in another way, to gain more volume, definitely, we will launch products to cover wider price band.
So as we mentioned that in the future, our product will cover between RMB 200,000 to RMB 500,000.
That's not to say we are going to reduce the price of some of our products.
We are going to design different product to cover different price points.
That's our philosophy.
And also, by the way, the market size of between RMB 200,000 to RMB 500,000 is increasing.
That's probably the only increasing segment in the -- yes, is a segment, the volume is increasing.
And about the future competition, starting from 2023, I think we will stick to our three key choices.
So the first one is that we compete in the overall PV market.
That's why we designed -- that's why we believe we have to solve the range anxiety issue.
That's one of the core value we want to deliver to our customer.
That's why you see we already have EREV solution, and we're going to have our next-generation EREV solution to completely solve the range anxiety issue for our customer.
And this is our midterm, long-term strategy.
We'll continue to launch EREV products.
On the other hand, we also see the opportunity to solve the range anxiety issue with the high-power charging solutions.
So that's why we have this new Whale and Shark platform.
This is the first choice.
The second choice is our target customer twice.
We want to focus only on the family users.
We see this as a growing demand segment.
And when we design our car, we want to design the car catering the needs of all the family members.
The third thing is that we will continue to focus on the autonomous driving solution development and also the smart cabin solution development.
So these three things are the fundamental building block of our product competitiveness.
We don't think we'll -- we believe we'll stick to these three key things.
Yeah. 
"
3964,LI,2021,2,kevin-shen,president,False,9,
3965,LI,2021,2,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Great.
Thanks for the opportunity.
Congratulations on the results.
Can management talk a little bit about competition and regulation.
So on competition, some of your incumbent peers have really speed up launching new products, Great Wall, Geely, BYD, for instance.
The frequency of their launches have increased and the hit rate seems also increased.
So just wondering if you have refreshed thoughts on their progress and also the potential for them to enter into the premium segment? So that's the question.
Second is about regulation.
So what's your thoughts on regulatory risk around autonomous driving and assisted driving development? Do you think if there is any regulatory intention to slow down things a bit in order to perfect the safety and customer experience? [Foreign language]

"
3967,LI,2021,2,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,2,
3968,LI,2020,4,bin-wang,credit-suisse,True,0,"[Foreign language] My question is about smart car issues because this year, any milestone event will happen for the smart car technology for Li Auto.
Meanwhile, how can you prove you can be -- catch up even -- or even better compare your key competitors such as Tesla, NIO and Xpeng? That's the first one.
The second one is about the dealer network.
You just mentioned you're expansion the dealer network.
Previously, that maybe go to 120 shops this year compared to -- or this year should be double.
Can we assume [Inaudible] as well? Thank you.

3971,LI,2020,4,lei-wang,cicc,True,0,"[Foreign language] Real quickly translate my questions.
So I want to raise the first question regarding the overseas strategies.
And another one to Kai Wang regarding the battery [Inaudible] if that's OK.
So it was reported that several competitors either have started deliveries in Norway or has the plan for European market as well.
I believe the overseas expansion was not part of our plan, but I was not sure whether you have changed it more or less considering the high penetration rates of the new electric vehicles in Europe And the second is battery question which wants to go to Mr.
Kai Wang, the CTO.
We have noticed that Tesla Motors and also BYD Han has been already using the LFP lithium ion batteries for cost saving.
Have you also considered using LFP instead of the NCM batteries? And if we got some time for retrograding, whether you can share what's the expectation or target for the [Inaudible] over this year?
"
3972,LI,2020,4,lei-wang,cicc,True,1,"OK.

The new question is from [Inaudible] Please go ahead.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language] The first question comes from Shanghai Research Center.
It is mentioned that there will be 2,000 staff there.
And could you give us more detail on that? And the second question is about recent R&D expense.
We noticed that R&D expenses keep increasing.
So what will be next one year or two, or maybe five years as to time range expectation for R&D expense?

All earnings call transcripts
"
3975,LI,2020,4,paul-gong,ubs,True,0,"Yeah.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Basically, I have two questions.
First one is related to the pure electric vehicle or the BEV technology.
You have already changed your strategy.
You have accelerated your BEV development during the past several months, I can see.
And you have announced the Whale and Shark platform for it.
And you are focused on the high-voltage and the fast charging.
Can you share with us more details, especially on the technology and road map and the time line of this BEV? And what does Whale and Shark mean? Does Whale means bigger space, bigger room and Shark means faster acceleration and higher speed? How should we understand these two platforms? My second question is regarding to the margin guidance for 2021.
Obviously, at this moment, you have been achieving pretty decent high teens of the gross margin and highly close to breakeven on the op margin.
But given, you already have enough financial resources, and you probably get higher market share, higher volumes to build up the branding as well as accumulative user base.
Will you strategically choose to focus on lower margin for 2021 in exchange of a higher market share? [Foreign language]
"
3976,LI,2020,4,paul-gong,ubs,True,1,"OK.

Next question is from Bin Wang of Credit Suisse.
"
3977,LI,2020,4,paul-gong,ubs,True,2,
3978,LI,2020,4,tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,0,"Thank you, Kai.
Hello, everyone.
I will now go over some of our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020.
To be mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage you to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Please note that currencies mentioned below are RMB.
Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 were RMB 4.15 billion, representing an increase of 65.2% from RMB 2.51 billion in the third quarter of 2020.
This included RMB 4.06 billion of vehicle sales in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 64.6% from the third quarter.
The increase in vehicle sales was mainly due to 67% increase in vehicle deliveries to 14,464 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 8,660 vehicles in the third quarter of 2020.
Revenues from other sales and services were RMB 89.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 93.5% from the third quarter.
The increase in revenues from other sales and services was in line with the increased vehicle sales and the increased number of vehicles using our services.
Cost of sales in the fourth quarter was RMB 3.42 billion, representing an increase of 70.1% from the third quarter.
Vehicle margin in the fourth quarter was 17.1% comparing to 19.8% in the third quarter of 2020.
The decrease was primarily due to the decreased onetime rebate from suppliers compared with the third quarter of 2020.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 17.5% compared to 19.8% in the third quarter which was mainly driven by the change in vehicle margin.
Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 803.5 million, representing an increase of 18.7% from RMB 676.7 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 were RMB 374.2 million representing an increase of 11.9% from RMB 334.5 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses were RMB 369.1 million, representing a quarter-over-quarter increase of 32.4%.
The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increased research and development activities for the company's next vehicle model and increased headcount, offset by the significant decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the third quarter, in which period higher cumulative share-based compensation expenses were recognized related to the stock option granted to employees with service conditions and performance conditions related to the IPO.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 were RMB 429.3 million, excluding share-based compensation expenses.
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB 426.8 million, representing an increase of 61.5%.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by the increased marketing and promotional activities and increased headcount, offset by the significant decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the third quarter of 2020, in which period higher cumulative share-based compensation expenses were recognized related to the stock options granted to employees with service conditions and performance conditions related to the IPO.
Losses from operations in the fourth quarter of 2020 was RMB 78.9 million, decreasing by 56.2% compared to a loss of RMB 180 million in the third quarter.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, the non-GAAP loss from operations was RMB 71.1 million, increasing by 58% from the third quarter of 2020.
Net income was RMB 107.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to RMB 106.9 million net loss in the third quarter of 2020.
Non-GAAP net income was RMB 115.4 million in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 621.3% from RMB 16 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits and short-term investments totaled RMB 29.87 billion as of December 31, 2020.
Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020 was RMB 1.82 billion, nearly doubled from RMB 929.8 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Free cash flow was RMB 1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 113.2% from RMB 749.9 million in the third quarter of 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 4,181 employees.
For more of our 2020 full year financial results, please refer to our earnings press release for further detail.
And now for our business outlook.
For the first quarter of 2021, the company expects deliveries to be between 10,500 and 11,500 vehicles, representing an increase of 262.6% to 277.1% from the first quarter of 2020.
The company also expects the first quarter's total revenues to be between RMB 2.94 billion to RMB 3.22 billion, representing an increase of 245.9% to 278.8% from the first quarter of 2020.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session.
Thank you.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you.
[Operator instructions] First question comes from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
"
3979,LI,2020,4,tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"Paul, this is Johnny.
I will answer the GPM question.
You can see, 2020, the full year gross margin is around 16%.
So for this year, 2021, we expect gross margin between 19% to 20% due to the increased volume with lower BOM and also the manufacturing overhead improvement.
But for the net profit side, we don't want to -- because we are still increased the investment in R&D and also the expansion of our network, as Kevin mentioned, we will accelerate that.
So we don't want to give any guidance on that.
And also, you should realize the net profit in the fourth quarter is due to the short-term investment income, which is [Inaudible] in China.
So it's -- yes.
"
3980,LI,2020,4,tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,2,"Yes.
And this is Johnny.
For the R&D, for 2020, is the early stage of our 2022's new model.
So this year, we will -- the R&D investment will increase to at least RMB 3 billion.
And with increasing investment in autonomous driving and new models, we expect R&D expense will reach USD 1 billion in three years.
And among that, we believe half of the investment will -- over half of the investments will be for the autonomous driving expenses.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
The fourth quarter capped off a year of significant growth and robust financial results for our company.
Our team's strong execution yielded record fourth quarter results that comfortably beat our outlook.
We delivered 14,464 Li ONEs in the fourth quarter, up 67% quarter over quarter.
Our robust deliveries drove revenue growth of 65.2% compared with the third quarter, reaching RMB 4.15 billion.
With 32,624 vehicles delivered to our users in 2020, Li ONE was the best-selling new energy SUV of the year in China, a testament to its highly competitive product features.
This outstanding performance was fueled by strong demand driven by our distinctive product offering and superior user experience, and made possible by our focused product strategy and our ability to rapidly scale up a consistent and high-quality manufacturing process to meet demand.
We believe that evolving consumer preferences for smart electric vehicles together with advancing technologies will continue to be tailwinds for our long-term sales growth.
Taking into consideration of seasonality and the impact of COVID-19 in Northern China, we expect our first quarter deliveries to be between 10,500 to 11,500 units.
On the profitability side, our gross margin remained robust at 17.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting our manufacturing efficiency and disciplined cost management approach.
Most notably, we achieved a record-high operating cash flow of RMB 1.82 billion, nearly doubled from the third quarter and raised USD 1.53 billion in proceeds through our successful follow-on offering, setting a solid financial foundation as we increase investment for autonomous driving technology and a BEV platform to drive our future growth.
We remain committed to proactively serving our users by anticipating their needs.
And as a response to the increased demand for our vehicles, we have steadily expanded our direct sales and servicing network.
As of January 31, 2021, we had 60 retail stores covering 47 cities and 121 servicing centers and also authorized the body and the paint shops operating in 89 cities.
We will continue to broaden and deepen city coverage to address increasing demand from prospective users across China and prepare ourselves for the new model launches in 2022 and beyond.
At the same time, we strive to continue strengthening our digital systems to integrate and connect all the stages of the sales and servicing processes to maintain a high level of sales efficiency.
As the user-driven automotive and technology company, we always prioritize our users' comfort and safety.
We are very proud of the outstanding safety rating results of our Li ONE achieved.
Li ONE was awarded the highest safety rating in three out of the four China Insurance Automotive Safety Index evaluation categories in January; five-star ratings in China Automobile Health Index assessment; and a five-star China New Car Assessment Program safety ratings in February, make it the only large premium SUV model that has received top scores in all three indexed programs.
We aim to make Li ONE best-in-class and believe that iteration is necessary for groundbreaking innovation.
We constantly collect feedbacks and the suggestions from our users through our app and also our customer service centers to provide update through FOTA.
By doing so, not only we delivered more value-added products and services, but also nurture a long-term relationship with our users, which will be very helpful to enhance the value in the long run.
Since the start of the delivery in December 2019, we have released the 13 major vehicle over-the-air upgrades.
On demand -- on December 26, 2020, our delivered software Version 2.0 through OTA updates bringing 12 new features such as front vehicle smart alert, adaptive cruise speed, dashboard camera playback, multiple user setting and also updating the copilot entertainment system.
Plus another 12 enhanced functions, including new interfaces for the dashboard, touch screen control panel and also updated applications such as navigation map.
As of February 18, we had users in 328 cities across China, with cumulative mileage exceeding 330 million kilometers.
97.1% of users expressed satisfaction with Li ONE in the survey we conducted in January 2021, and were willing to recommend Li ONE to their friends.
As always, we are grateful for the consistent support and trust from our users.
Looking forward, we will accelerate the development of second-generation extended-range platform and also the high-voltage BEV technologies in order to enrich our model mix to cater to the needs of a wider range of users, while adhering to our brand positioning of premium smart electric vehicle.
All of these efforts are aiming at maximizing the value proposition for our users.
We are planning on the reconfiguration of our state-of-the-art Changzhou factory for our new model pipeline, especially the full-size premium SUV based on brand-new architecture to be launched in 2022.
With the establishment of our Shanghai R&D center, we are also expediting our R&D effort across the board.
Having successfully completed the first phase of our strategic cycle and entered the second stage this year, we will continue racing ahead toward our mission, creating homes on the move that bring happiness to the entire family.
With that, I would like to turn it over to our CTO, Mr.
Kai Wang, for a closer review of our R&D efforts.
Please go ahead, Kai.
"
3989,LI,2020,4,yanan-shen,president,False,1,"Thank you, Fei Fang.
This is Kevin.
I'll answer your questions.
Your first question, we think that a modest month-over-month decline does not mean that our sales are encountering bottleneck.
Single model sales of over 5,000 per month still demonstrate that our Li ONE is very competitive.
Deliveries in January 2021 were 5,379 and in December was 6,126, an average for these two months were 5,753.
These numbers are in line with our prior growth expectations.
We think that during the Chinese Spring festival in February and also the upcoming Chinese Lantern Festival, our sales will be affected by the seasonality for sure.
In addition, considering the impact of COVID-19 in Northern China, we are putting out a relatively conservative delivery guidance for the first quarter of 2021.
We are confident that with the expansion of our retail store and the effective control of the pandemic, our sales will gradually increase.
About the -- your second question about Shanghai.
The policy change in Shanghai was within our expectation, with an implementation time that is even later than we expected.
Also, we believe the details of this policy and this implementation may change in the coming two years.
We keep a constant communication with Shanghai local authorities.
The implementation of this policy in 2023 will actually encourage users to purchase EV and PHEV and also EREVs in advance.
We expect the demand for EREV and PHEV will, in fact, reach a peak in 2022.
On the other side, Shanghai only account for 9% of our total deliveries in 2020.
And this policy change will have a relatively small impact on our company as a whole.
Cities without license restrictions account for more than 55% of our accumulated deliveries by the end of 2022.
So the distribution is very healthy.
We are also accelerating the R&D of our BEV platform, and the launch of the BEV model, which is expected in 2023.
"
3990,LI,2020,4,yanan-shen,president,False,2,"Thanks, Tim.
This is Kevin.
I will try to answer your first question about the sales efficiency.
I think the company has already -- our company has already entered the second strategic cycle, in which we will launch more models in the coming years.
Therefore, we will not take the sales efficiency of 100 vehicles per store as the single target.
Considering to keep the store sales efficiency in a relatively healthy level, we will more aggressively increase our retail stores this year -- starting from this year and beyond to prepare for the launch of our multiple models starting from 2022.
Xiang Li, do you want to comment on the second question?
"
3991,LI,2020,4,yanan-shen,president,False,3,"OK.
For the benefit of those who do not speak Mandarin, this is Kevin, let me try to translate what Xiang Li just described.
So first of all, Xiang Li believes that it will take about three years for any company to develop a car from scratch, from setting up the team, project initiation, R&D, testing and product launch.
It also will take another actual one year to test the car in the market.
So right now, we have already Xiang Li -- Li Auto has already completed all these three and entered the third phase of strategic cycle.
So in the coming three, four years, which we are ahead of those new entry companies, we will accelerate the speed of our development to build out our competitive advantage.
We think, by 2024, we will have the three major competitive advantages compared to those newcomers.
First is the market share and the user base, we already gained by then.
It will be nearly 0.5 million to one million.
Second advantage we'll have is our sales and service channel.
By then, we should already have -- our target is to have more than 1,000 retail stores.
And also our factory capacity, our supply chain capacity and also our charging infrastructure will all become a competitive advantage for us.
Last thing, it's also very important that our -- by then, our product portfolio will be much bigger, and we'll have both EREV portfolio and high-voltage BEV portfolio, which will give, I say, a big advantage over the new entry companies.
So we respect those who want to enter this industry very much.
But we think the timing is on our side.
We already passed the zero to one phase, and we are already in the one to 10 phase, and we are accelerating our new product R&D and launch.

Right.
Thank you, Mr.
LI.
Thanks for the great color.

Our next question is from the line of Paul Gong of UBS.
"
3992,LI,2020,4,yanan-shen,president,False,4,"OK.
Yes.
This is Kevin.
I'll translate.
I will try to translate, a lot of content.
So first of all, we have been developing our high-voltage BEV platform for some time.
And our focus is to be able to enable our customer to replenish the energy with very high speed.
This is the mission we give to us starting from the beginning of this company.
And now we believe with the technology and also with the standard that the Chinese government and all authorities are planned.
Right now, it's in the right timing to start to develop this product and try to introduce it into the market very soon.
So to achieve this high-voltage ultra-faster speed charging platform, there are four fundamental technologies we have to develop.
The first, of course, is the high C-rate battery.
We are working with our partners on the 4x charge of C-rate battery.
This is not a product we direct buy from our supplier, we developed it together with our partners.
Second is, of course, the very high-efficiency e-powertrain system.
I think at the core of this solution is the SiC technology, yes.
The third thing is about the thermal system.
As you can imagine, we are facing two issues.
One is when we charge this car with very high speed, the heat we need to manage.
That require a very sophisticated thermal system.
On the other hand, to make sure the user experience is very good in even very low temperature.
We also have -- need to have our thermal system can cater the need when they're using low temperature.
And one example is, for example, our R&D team is working on the CO2 thermostat as the cold medium solution for the thermal system.
The last technology, of course, is the high-power charging network.
Our target is to enable 300 to 500 kilometers range within 10 to 15 minutes, yes.
That's what we call also the 400 kilowatt high-power charging network.
Because of the ultra-fast charging speed, the business model starts to become viable for real commercial charging station, which means the charging business to become profitable.
So therefore, we also have a plan to start to build our own HPC, high-power charging networks, yes.
So from the product launch plan, starting from 2022, we will launch at least two new products each year onward.
And the first BEV product will be launched in 2023.
On the other hand, we'll cover a wider price range with our portfolio.
Now we -- our plan is to cover a price range from RMB 150,000 to RMB 500,000.
So overall, our target is to accelerate the replacement of ICE cars, yes.
And we have two solutions.
Both are very good, EREV solution and the BEV solution.
Lastly, to answer Paul's question about the Whale and Shark.
The Whale platform is a car form that with more space in the car, and for shark as you can imagine from its name, the performance of this platform will be higher.
All right?
"
3993,LI,2020,4,yanan-shen,president,False,5,"Yes, this is Kevin.
Thank you, Bin Wang.
For the sales network, our company has already entered the second phase, as just now I mentioned, that with the Li Auto brand increasingly accepted by users.
In fact, we are changing gears.
We are adjusting our store expansion strategy accordingly.
So this year, our goal is to reach 200 retail stores in this year, covering 100 cities.
This is our plan.
As you can see, this is a relatively aggressive plan.
The expansion of our sales network will need to increase the sales for sure and also the brand enhancement.
I think behind this plan is that we are preparing us for the new model launches in 2022 and beyond.
"
3994,LI,2020,4,yanan-shen,president,False,6,"Yes.
Thank you, Lei.
This is Kevin.
Let me take your questions.
First of all, of course, we are committed to become a global leader of smart electric vehicle, ultimately.
So definitely, we'll continue the overseas market.
In the past several years, our strategy is to focus on China market only.
But at the same time, we are continuously monitoring the progress of the global market.
And this year, particularly, we are -- we will continue to increase our focus on research on the overseas market and initiate planning for the product and the sales channels for the overseas market, including establishing overseas offices, definitely we'll go to overseas.
For your second question about LFP.
In fact, for our EREV platform, we have no plan to launch with lithium phosphate batteries for two reasons.
First of all, right now, all the LFP on the market cannot meet our performance requirement because EREV has a different performance requirement compared with the BEV.
Second is because EREV use less kilowatt hour battery.
So therefore, even we use LFP, the cost benefit will be not significant for us.
And for the next step for our BEVs, definitely, we are in the process of researching development -- and developing both kind of batteries.
For sure, we'll consider LFP for our future BEV car models.

3996,LI,2020,4,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,0,"[Foreign language] Let me just translate for myself very quickly.
My first question is about the sequential decline of the first quarter volume guidance.
Can management elaborate on the decline, what drives it on the demand or supply side? Second question is about the recent car plate policy from the Shanghai government.
The city obviously announced it will no longer provide green plate to plug-in vehicles effective in 2023.
Can you talk about your view on this and your projected impact on forward performance? Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Jerry Su of Morgan Stanley.
Your line is open.
Unknown speaker
[Foreign language].
So let me quickly translate my questions.
My first question, can management team share the official guidance regarding the numbers of stores we plan to open in 2021.
With the broader sales network [Inaudible] operating efficiency and give average monthly sales per store at around 100 units? My second question is about the competitive landscape.
We saw a lot of tech companies step into EV market, like 5G, Apple, Xiaomi.
So what kind of impact or disruption, do you think these new entrants could bring to the EV and the autonomous driving market? And what would be the implication to Li Auto? Thank you.

3999,LI,2020,4,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,0,"Thank you, Kevin.
Hello, everyone.
Let me share with you the progress we have made on R&D since the last earnings call.
We are on course with our brand-new architectures for the full-size premium electric SUV to be launched in 2022.
It features a scalable and [Inaudible] upgradeable ECU and sensor set enabling more use cases via OTA.
In particular, we are collaborating closely with NVIDIA and Desay SV to equip our next model with the powerful NVIDIA Orin SoC chipset.
With scalable setup, we could expand our vehicles' overall computing power up to 2,000 TOPS.
Along with our complete in-house algorithm and closed-loop data environment, we can progressively reach level-4 autonomous driving.
The projects goes well and everything is on track.
One of the priorities for me as CTO is to attract brilliant scientists, researchers and engineers to join our team to developing cutting-edge smart electrical vehicle technologies as we aim to bring world changing innovations to people's everyday lives.
We are excited to kick off 2021 with announcement of our new R&D center in Shanghai, dedicated to the development of cutting-edge electric vehicle technologies such as high-voltage platforms and ultra-fast charging technologies.
This R&D center will have end-to-end development capabilities for new models.
We chose Shanghai as the location due to the abundant availability of topnotch talents with expertise in smart vehicles in and around the city alongside a rich supply chain.
As establishment, we are not only accelerate our new model launches and development of smart vehicle technologies, but also our recruiting efforts.
Recruiting at R&D center has already started.
We will ultimately build a team of over 2,000 staffs.
In meanwhile, we are establishing collaborations with top universities and research institutes in China.
More updates will be released in future.
Now I will turn this call over to our CFO, Mr.
Tie Li, to review our financial performance in the fourth quarter.
"
4000,LI,2020,4,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,1,"So I would like to take over the first question.
This is Kai speaking.
Regarding the plan in 2021.
So we will spend more money on R&D.
It is the year for preparation of our in-house brand new scalable and upgradeable system architecture, covering next-generation intelligent [Inaudible] autonomous driving, car computing platform and our own operating -- car operating system, which we'll be releasing in 2022.
Of course, in meanwhile, similar features offered by our competitors, plus some brand-new features will be provided to our customers for sure.
From engineering resource point of view, we will double size of our total R&D staff as we mentioned.
So building Shanghai R&D center is part of this expansion.
So regarding competition, we have confidence to prove ourselves efficiency again as we did financially last year.
So we believe with fast expansion of our R&D, exciting news regarding our in-house technology like autonomous driving can be unveiled soon.
Thank you.
"
4001,LI,2020,4,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,2,"Yes.
I think it's too early to give the full year guidance, but we will expand our network, as Kevin mentioned -- and -- to reach 10,000 to 12,000 as soon as possible, per month.
Thank you.
"
4002,LI,2020,4,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,3,"This is Kai speaking.
Regarding the question about R&D activity, so the definition of Shanghai R&D center it will be mirrored configuration as Beijing R&D Center for more car models and also advanced R&D activities.
Regarding the team of our, let's say, others, so altogether, right now, we have more than 300 engineers working for that.
And we would like to reach to, yes, up to 600 in total end of this year.

Congratulations on the great margin and also [Inaudible].
I believe, I just finished [Inaudible] non-GAAP targets that's starting a great move.
Congratulations.
[Foreign language] So the first question goes to say for Mr.
Li Tie.
So how may Li Auto actually keep the roughly 20% of GPM? It's barely 8,600 quarter.
It was Tesla actually nearly achieved 19% of GPM in first half of last year was almost 10 times your rates.
And then the second question goes to Mr.
Wang Kai for the -- [Inaudible] if you don't mind.
You were actually great sharer wisdom on drive core and proposed a weekly OEM statement growth.
Right? And can you provide more colors on the update [Inaudible] since you now joined in OEM yourself? [Foreign language]

So congratulations on the results for the recent one.
It seems like its first model has really proven itself and your guidance is showing this moment can continue.
My question is how we framed it.
Is it framed of thinking about when is the right time to develop a second model? And then strategically, what types of vehicles are we looking at for the second model? In particular, I want to ask about a concept that [Inaudible] released back in the early years of the company for a compact sedan.
I think it was on the SUV.
I'm wondering if that has a design that is still on its operation.

Thanks guys for taking my question.
I have two questions.
First one is regarding the network expansion.
So far you have a much smaller distribution network, but you have demonstrated much higher efficiency than your close peers.
Going forward, how do you foresee your distribution channel expansion? Do you have enough market to expand how many stores by end of this year and end of next year? And more importantly, how do you foresee the per-store sales volume? Could be maintained at which level? My second question is regarding the autonomous driving roadmap.
I heard Kai said, Rome was not built within one day, but I would be really curious to know what would be your roadmap on time line at which year you are going to achieve certain level and what would be the hardware solution where you include lighter, or were you including even more cameras and internet solution, and what do you aim to achieve at -- in this stage? And beside of that, you have some -- some of your competitors are choosing to sell the software for extra package or extra money, but given you kept already one at the same specs.
Will you choose to sell the software as an optional package or will you choose to install the software on every vehicle you sell, just as you did in the Li ONE.

Hello, everyone.
I will now go over some of our financial results for the third quarter of 2020.
To be mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage you to refer to our earnings press release which is posted online for additional details.
Total revenue in the third quarter of 2020 were RMB 2.51 billion, representing a increase of 28.9% from RMB 1.95 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
This include vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2020, which were RMB 2.46 billion, representing an increase of 28.4% from the second quarter of 2020.
The increase in vehicle sales was mainly due to 31.1% increase in vehicle deliveries to 8,660 vehicles in the third quarter of 2020 from 6,604 vehicles in the second quarter of 2020.
Revenue for other sales and services was RMB 46.1 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing a increase of 64.1% from the second quarter.
The increase in other sales and services was in line with the increased vehicle sales and the increasing vehicle volume using our services.
Cost of sales in the third quarter was RMB 2.01 billion, representing a increase of 19.3% from the second quarter.
Vehicle margin in the third quarter was 19.8%, compared to 13.7% in the second quarter of 2020.
The increase of vehicle margin was primarily attributable to the decrease in purchase price of certain materials, including a one-time rebate received from a supplier and lower unit manufacturing overhead costs due to increased production volume.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 19.8%, compared to 13.3% in the second quarter, which was mainly driven by the increase in vehicle margin.
Total operating expenses in the third quarter were RMB 676.7 million, representing an increase of 55.2% from RMB 436 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2020 were RMB 334.5 million, representing a increase of 66.1% from RMB 201.4 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding stock-based compensation expenses, the adaptive research and development expenses were RMB 278.8 million, representing a quarter-over-quarter increase of 38.4%.
The increase was primarily attributable to starting research and development for our next model, as well as increased headcount.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2020 were RMB 342.2 million excluding share-based compensation expenses, the adaptive selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB 264.2 million, representing a increase of 12.7%.
The increase was primarily driven by increased headcount as well as increased marketing and promotional expenses.
Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2020 was RMB 180 million, compared to a loss of RMB 176.3 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, the non-GAAP adjusted loss operations was RMB 45 million, decreasing 74.5% from the second quarter of 2020.
Net loss was RMB 106.9 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to RMB 75.2 million loss in the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses and changes in fair value of warrants clothing, service, compensation, and expenses and changes in fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities, we achieved positive bottom line with adjusted net income of RMB 16 million in the third quarter, compared to RMB 159.2 million adjusted net loss in the second quarter of 2020.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.
The balance sheet of our cash and cash equivalent, restricted cash, cash deposits, and short-term investments was RMB 18.92 billion as of September 30, 2020, compared to RMB 3.71 billion as of December 31, 2019.
The increase was primarily driven by issuance of Series D private financing, the completion of our IPO, and concurrent private placements.
Operating cash flow in the third quarter of 2020 was RMB 929.8 million, more than doubled from RMB 451.7 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Free cash flow was RMB 749.9 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing a increase of 149.3% from RMB 300.8 million in the second quarter of 2020.
And now for our business outlook.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, the company expect deliveries to be between 11,000 and 12,000 vehicles, representing a increase of approximately 27% to 38.6% from the third quarter of 2020.
The company also expect fourth-quarter total revenues to be between RMB 3.11 billion, USD 457.8 million, and RMB 3.39 billion, USD 499.4 million, representing a increase of 23.7% to 35.1% from the third quarter of 2020.
Now I will turn the call over to the operator to start our Q&A session.
Thank you.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] We have our first question from the line of Fei Fang from Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
"
4013,LI,2020,3,tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,1,"OK.
This is Li Tie.
I will take the first question.
As I mentioned earlier, the increase of margin this quarter was primarily attributable to the decrease in purchase of certain materials including one-time rebate from -- received from supplier.
And also the lower unit manufacturing or higher cost as our volume production -- volume increase.
And we are very confident the GP margin for the whole year will around 15% and improve steadily next year.
And I think for Tesla, I think you guys should be, yes, more familiar than us.
Starting from the very early stage of plants like Tesla models, Model X, and what Tesla has around from 15% to 20% margin and also modest rate.
And then if they got a better BOM cost, they will lower the price.
So they have to keep their margin around 100%.
I think it's their strategy.
So it's now they use this volume to raise that GP margin because they have seen it in their first model.
First big volume model of Model X.
Then I will pass to Mr.
Kai Wang.
"
4014,LI,2020,3,tie-li,chief-financial-officer,False,2,
4015,LI,2020,3,tim-hsiao,morgan-stanley,True,0,"[Foreign language] So my first question is about R&D spending.
Based on the financial quarter result, we noticed that Li Auto's R&D spending in terms of the absolute amount or percentage to the revenues seems to be lower than other auto EVP years.
So it's part of our duty to keep an eye on cannibalization of cost control, but in light of the growing investment in technology innovation and also autonomous driving next year, could management or Li Auto keep such a relatively lower R&D spending, or how should we think about the trajectory into 2021? And my second question is about the competitive landscape because we noticed that the competitive landscape this year is quite benign.
And looking into the next year 2021, the market might be getting more crowded with Tesla Model Y, Volkswagen MEB base model.
In the meantime, we also noticed other local peers like [Inaudible] and the [Inaudible] group also launched an extended range EV, EREV.
So how could Li Auto stay competitive in terms of the product and strategy? So those are my two questions.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
We are very excited to announce the result of our opening quarters as a public company following our July 30 listing.
In the third quarter, we achieved robust results.
We delivered 8,660 Li ONEs in the third quarter, which represented a quarter-over-quarter increase of 31.1% versus our deliveries in Q2.
As of the end of October, cumulative deliveries in 2020 reach 21,852 vehicles.
According to new car insurance registration data reported by China Automotive Technology and Research Center, in September and October Li ONE become the best-selling new energy SUV among all models in China, a very strong testament through its highly competitive product features.
In addition, in October, our order showed strong growth, setting a new monthly record and giving us solid confidence in our fourth-quarter deliveries, which we expect to reach 11,000 to 12,000 units and achieve a new quarterly record.
At the same time, we have improved our gross margin and operating cash flow due to increased deliveries, improved BOM cost, and overall operating and manufacturing efficiency.
In the third quarter, our gross margin expanded to 19.8%, compared to 13.3% in the second quarter.
We also generated an operating cash flow of RMB 929.8 million, which is 105.8% higher than the prior quarter.
In terms of R&D, we will further increase our investment in this regard and continue to leverage technology to create value for users and to optimize our user experience.
Through product and technology innovations, we are committed to providing our supplier users with safer, easier, and more cost-effective mobility solutions, ensuring we live up to their support and trust.
In September, we added the important new role of CTO to our senior management roster with Mr.
Kai Wang joining our team from Visteon.
This new addition reflects our philosophy and the pursuit of combining expertise from the automotive smart device and internet industries and building an outstanding team across many disciplines to develop smart vehicles for our users.
With Mr.
Wang's visionary judgment and thinking, profound expertise, and impressive track record, we believe Mr.
Wang will make crucial contributes to our product and the company.
To constantly provide a best-in-class experience to our users, we continually evolve and optimize our vehicle through full-time updates throughout the entire vehicle life cycle We also continuously collect performance and behavior data from our users to drive our product iterations.
By the end of October, we have released 10 major vehicle OTA upgrades to Li ONE users to provide them with a better driving experience.
Moving to our digitalized direct sales and service network.
It's an essential component of our closed-loop business system.
This network feeds direct user usage data and feedback to both our R&D team and service team for us to analyze and optimize vehicle features and after-sales services, ultimately aiming to optimize the user experience.
As of the end of October, we had 41 retail stores covering 36 cities in China, maintaining a high level of operational efficiency to each retail store demonstrate that we have completed a closed-loop system setup.
Next, we plan further grow the system to create an efficient virtuous cycle of user feedback vehicle development and service enhancement.
We cannot achieve our results without the support and trust of our users.
As a user-driven automotive and technology enterprise, Li Auto always puts our users at the highest priority and will spend more effort to provide our users with safer, more convenient, and more value-added products and services to further realize our idea of car and home.
This concludes my prepared to remark.
Now our CTO, Mr.
Kai Wang, will discuss more of the R&D aspect of our business.
Please go ahead.
"
4023,LI,2020,3,kevin-shen,president,False,1,"OK.
This is Kevin.
Thank you, Fang Fei.
I will answer your question.
First, as we can see that since the launch of Li ONE, we have already seen some substantial improvements of our gross margin.
This is due to the BOM cost reduction and also the manufacturing efficiency.
So as our volume increase gradually we'll be able to procure auto parts at the lower price and continuously reduce the manufacturing.
So this trend will not change.
Some of the numbers that you should already see that reflected in the financial numbers shared by DTA just now.
For the Nvidia collaboration, I will turn over to Mr.
Wang Kai.
Yeah?

Then for the second question about the reason to recall.
Currently, the recall-related work is progressing steadily and expects it to take about three months for us to complete.
We handled this recall with transparency and efficiency.
This is a reflection of our company's core value.
We always put our customer at first priority.
That's why we got quite positive feedback from our existing users and potential buyers.
So far after the announcement of the recall, the growth momentum of our new orders remain the same as before.
No major impact observed.
As for the costs related to this recall, we think your estimation is about right.
Yes.
It's in line with our estimation.

Thank you.
We have our next question coming from the line of Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
"
4027,LI,2020,3,kevin-shen,president,False,5,"OK.
Thank you, Li.
This is Kevin.
I will try to translate all these comments.
Yes, I have already noted down.
So for the R&D investment, this was our strategy.
We decided four, five years ago, yes, we want to invest all our resources into one car model, yes.
This was our strategy.
And for our Li ONE as you may know that we only have this Li ONE and for Li ONE we only have one configuration.
This has put a big challenge to us, but also gives us a lot of advantages.
First advantage is the software upgrade because we only have one conflagration.
Other OTA becomes much easier.
Second is for the supply chain efficiency perspective.
As you can imagine our forecast is very accurate and our suppliers the efficiency of our suppliers also very high because we only have one configuration.
The third is our internal efficiency, also very high because we only have one configuration.
That's why our R&D resources do not need to -- we do not need to invest R&D money on a different configuration.
Yes.
So this was our strategy and the reality right now we see prove that our strategy was right.
Actually, as you already know that in the past 10 months, we have always been the number selling model in the large size new energy SUV, yes.
So for the next step, we'll continue to maintain our efficiency.
Very high R&D efficiency, but at the same time, our investment in R&D will be multiple times for our second generation of products starting from 2022.
Each year we'll have at least one car model but we'll stay with our strategy that for each car model we only have one conflagration.
We want to focus our resources down to one configuration.
And our strategy is for any car model we launch into the market, our target is to make it the number one selling model in its price segment.
OK? For your second question, it's about the competitive landscape.
First, next year we're going to introduce more function into -- feature and function into our existing Li ONE to ensure that our competitiveness will not -- will continue to be improved.
You mentioned the Model Y? Actually compared with Model Y, Li ONE is a much bigger car with more space and is designed for the Chinese family.
And its performance and its size and feature is comparable with Model X.
So we are not worried about Model Y.
And for the EREV, for the range extension solution, actually you're right.
There are a group of OEMs are introducing new EREV models into the market next year.
But from our viewpoint, range extension solution is not a technology choice.
It's just a solution for us to help our customer to replenish the energy.
Right? So Tesla working on their supercharge, NIO working on battery swapping.
We working on EREV.
These are all energy replenishment solution, but for the customer really buy a car, a very convenient energy replenish method is only one consideration.
Ultimately the customer is buying an intelligent, I'll say, smart electric vehicle.
So their focus primarily is first about the product.
The product, the design, the product feature function need to be very competitive.
That's why we are not worried about other people also build the EREV because the core of our competitive advantage is our product itself.
OK?
"
4028,LI,2020,3,kevin-shen,president,False,6,"This is Kevin.
Thank you, Paul.
I will take your first question and Mr.
Wang Kai will take your second one.
So for the retail stores, we plan to expand the number of retail store to 50 to 60 across most of the cities in China by end of this year.
As we extend our direct sales and service network, we are quite confident that we can leverage our growing brand recognition and to maintain the sales efficiency of each store.
And if compared with some of our peers, we took a different approach.
So some of our peers, their approaches to quickly expand the number of retail stores to cover more cities, then try to slowly improve their sales efficiency at a later stage.
We took a different approach.
We implement gradually.
We implement gradual expansion of our sales network, and we try to maintain a high of sales efficiency per store.
OK? Kai?

4029,LI,2020,3,kevin-shen,president,False,7,"Thank you.
Operator
Thank you.
We have our next question from the line of Mei Ho from US Tiger Securities.
Please go ahead.
Unknown speaker
Hi.
Good quarter.
Thank you for taking my question.
I have a few ones about EREV.
There has been market chatters in your policies regarding EREV last [Inaudible] can we change in tier one cities like Beijing or Shanghai.
So how could you prepare for such changes if EREV is no longer entitled to only be licensed in one particular important city.
How could that impact your overall sales target? And secondly, at a higher level, what do you think of government support on EREV? Lastly, if we -- for longer horizon, what's your plan for BEV transition such as this? [Foreign language]
"
4030,LI,2020,3,kevin-shen,president,False,8,"Yes.
This is Kevin.
I will try to answer the first half of your question, then leave the second half to Mr.
Li Xiang to comment on our BEV strategy.
So for the government policy, actually, we have being very proactively communicate with all kinds of government bodies.
However, we cannot predict our comment about the policy, which will be introduced by the local government.
But to answer your question, actually, I give you an example either in Beijing, Beijing is a city where the license policy is the most restrictive to us.
Our sales are still very, very strong.
Yeah.
So our sales in cities were to not have license plates restriction accounted for more than 60% of our total sales in both September and October.
That's to say our vehicle sales are not dependent on the policy incentives are not very sensitive to the cap rate policy.
Yeah.
So -- and also for the overall national policy, in general, China's national policy and regulation encourage the coexistence of multiple forms of new energy vehicles, including BEV, also plugging hybrid EIV and even the hydrogen new energy.
So for us, we already see that the direction this coexistence direction has already first being further confirmed by the recent release, the national new energy automotive industry development class.
Yeah.
So overall, the National Policy is in favor of EREV.
And for the BEV plan, I will turn over to Mr.
Li Xiang to comment.
"
4031,LI,2020,3,kevin-shen,president,False,9,"Thank you, Li Xiang.
I will try to -- this is Kevin again.
I will try to translate what the -- Xiang just explained.
First of all, our goal is to build a high-level premium smart electric vehicle.
So this is our goal.
When we look at this market, the key issue we need to solve is the charging issue.
Right? How our customer replenish their energy is the key for the user experience.
And we are keep a very close eye on the second-generation charging solution which is very clear to us, is 400-kilowatt charging infrastructure, with which can charge a car four to five times faster than today's infrastructure.
For this second-generation charging infrastructure, it will benefit both the customer and the business.
From the customer's perspective, they don't need to -- their car can be charged today 10, 15 minutes.
They don't need to leave their car when the car is being charged.
So they can stay in the car.
And, therefore, from the business perspective when the charging speeds have become that fast the business model becomes viable.
Yeah.
Because today for the slow charging actually the charging station cannot make money.
The business model doesn't work, but when the charging speeds become faster.
The business model becomes viable.
Yes.
So to achieve this 400-kilowatt charging solution there are three technology dependencies.
First is that the 800-volt high voltage vehicle platform.
Second is the government regulation on the 500 amp current regulation.
And the third is very important is that the battery cell, which can sustain for C targeting.
So we are -- again, we are keeping a very close eye on these three technology evolvement.
And we cannot disclose yet when we are going to be with BEV, but when these three technology become a mature and available to us.
Well, definitely a work on the BEV solution.
But the overall again, to emphasize that rent extension solution from our viewpoint is a long-term solution.
It's not that interim solution because the EREV solution is the best defeat for the larger size SUV to -- so even when the second generation of charging for company become available.
EREV still one of our viewpoints, one of the mainstream of technology choices.
OK.
Thank you.

Great.
Great.
Thank you so much.
Operator
Thank you.
We have our next question from the line of Yang [Inaudible] from [Inaudible].
Please go ahead.
Unknown speaker
Thank you for the opportunity.
And I have a quick question about when -- it appears that Tesla has launched their own autonomous chip, and also NIO has announced that we're trying to launch their own autonomous chip.
So my question is that, [Inaudible] rates or autonomous vehicle, and what's our plan on that? Do we plan to launch our self-drive chips too? Thank you.
[Foreign language]
"
4032,LI,2020,3,kevin-shen,president,False,10,"OK.
Thank you, Li Xiang.
This is Kevin.
I will translate what Li Xiang just described.
So first of all, we are still in our initial phase of our company.
We focus on one car model and one product.
Our goal is to achieve the -- with the Li ONE, we want to achieve become the top-selling model in its price segment which is 300K to 350K RMB price segment.
With this first product, we want to leverage this first product to build, and also to prove that our sales, our sales and service, our supply chain, and our R&D, all closed-loop OK system.
Secondly, of course, we are working on -- our ADR already are working on our second product.
So as we already discussed in 2022, we are going to launch our next product, which is the full-size EREV SUV.
As for the SEV, actually, we already stopped this project in the end of 2017.
Yeah.
And we have no further investment in this project.
We think we are in a very good position in this SUV segment for family.
So we will stay in this segment.
We'll stay very focused on our existing segment.
Yeah.
Robert, thank you.

4033,LI,2020,3,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,0,"Thanks.
[Foreign language] Kevin, Kai, very impressive results.
Congrats on the tremendous progress.
Let me start with two questions.
First is about the supply chain, reflecting on Li ONEs scaling sales, how would you plan to drive better sourcing efficiency and prices from here? For example, for battery price, which is obviously a chunky part of your BOM was the opportunity to cut costs further from here.
And also can management shed some light on the progress with Nvidia's partnership.
When do you plan to deploy the components? Second is about the recall incidents in the past few weeks.
Can you discuss the latest progress with hardware replacement and also what has been the impact on Li ONE's backlog, if any? For compacts, our own analysis is that this is a RMB 10 million cost issue, which is 0.1% of your annual revenues.
So want to see if you're having any response to that? [Foreign language]
"
4034,LI,2020,3,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,1,"That's great to hear.
Thanks for the response, and congrats again.
"
4035,LI,2020,3,fei-fang,goldman-sachs,True,2,
4036,LI,2020,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,0,"Thank you for the introduction, Kevin.
Hello, everyone.
It's my honor to join Li Auto recently led by entrepreneur Mr.
Xiang Li.
I would like to share my thoughts on the R&D initiative as CTO of the company.
I'm a believer in progressive innovation because Rome was not built in one day.
It has always been a better approach to follow the natural law of evolution to implement technological concepts step by step, prioritizing user demand, This, I believe, echoes well with Li Auto's guiding principle.
Leveraging technology to create value for users, to optimize user experience steadily and continuously.
From a technology roadmap point of view, the CTO office will focus on in-house development of anything that has a direct impact on our end-user experiences, such as intelligent cabin, ADAS/autonomous driving, and car-related cutting edge technologies, such as cloud, data mining, and so on.
We will also leverage top tiers partner support to achieve our objective.
In September, we announced a third wave of strategic collaboration with global semiconductor giant Nvidia and Chinese domestic leader Desay SV to be the first OEM in the world, implementing Nvidia flagship chipset Orin in vehicle in order to provide a premium user experience.
To support these R&D activities, we will increase our investment in R&D and the size of our team continuously.
For example, we will expand our autonomous driving team size by three times by the first half of 2021.
I'm confident in our capability to execute this roadmap and continue to build a leading position in the intelligent automotive industry.
Now I will turn this call over to our CFO, Mr.
Tie Li, for a closer look at our financial performance in the third quarter.
"
4037,LI,2020,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,1,"Yeah.
This is Kai speaking.
So regarding collaboration with Nvidia, I think everything is on track.
In software part, we have already partied our software into Nvidia Cowen Xavier platform for vehicle-level road tests with already good result.
We will continue on software development and testing and to our Orin based hardware is available.
In the hardware side, we are working closely with both Nvidia and Desay SV.
I think everything is in control with good progress.
And I think in future, we will provide more updates regarding the topic.
Thank you.
"
4038,LI,2020,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,2,"Yeah.
Yeah.
This is Kai.
I will take over the question regarding the roadmap of up and striving.
So regarding auto/driving roadmap, I think we will continuously improve our existing software and develop more features for users.
So with our current hardware platform, new features such as fully automated parking assist, AKA, app APA on basis of fusion of user signing and vision inputs will be released via full time in 2021.
And also more feature will follow as well.
We will unveil more in future.
In 2022, we will launch brand new architecture of our new vehicles, which contains a scalable and hardware upgradable ECU, and sensor set along with more use case updates via full time, so that our products could achieve up to level four autonomous driving progressively.
That's our goal.
Based on current research and the technology baseline, we don't believe level five fully automated driving without any interfering by human come in near future, because it really requires technology breakthrough in areas such as quantum computing and other such kinds of algorithm along with it.
So therefore our focus will be on what kind of real value we can bring to our customer toward, let's say, progressively and steadily to kind of a level four experience.
That's the most important topic for us.
We believe with clear goal sighting and also excellent execution.
We would become a leader of autonomous driving in the industry.
To achieve these plan, I think I already described roughly the time line.
So our team size will be crumbled in 2021 has I already mentioned versus current situation.
We already have very good progress recently on senior-level experts and management hiring.
The new commerce either well-known from industry all with graduation, from top universities, such as Stanford or Berkeley and Salaam.
On top of that, we also have established a strategic collaboration with our partners different than the normal collaboration, they are tightly integrated with our team.
With onsite co-development as part of a few of our R&D exploration.
So regarding your last question about, if we're going to charge our user regarding the software part, we won't charge anything below level three, because we think that's essential features for them.
So everything below level three will be for free.
Thank you.
"
4039,LI,2020,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,3,"Yeah.
Regarding your second question is a very good question.
So actually my philosophy still stands, but probably maybe I -- please allow me to explain the spirit of the philosophy.
So the tree structure represents, let's say, the automotive profit distribution structure and the collaboration amount, let's say the old partners here.
So you can imagine the traditional way.
There are lots of trees in a forest.
So every OEM trolled the tiers precisely, I mean the margin of them, because they control the key.
Let's say the barrier, the core barrier.
This is the gasoline engine, but nowadays the situation is totally changed because now we entered to from industry era to intelligent era.
It's a complete new business model, and it will be applied if you want to win from the market.
And then I introduced the so-called not ring structure, but round table structure.
That means now there are lots of alliance among OEM, among tier one, tier two, whatever you can call it, even the new let's say business model providers such as Uber or like DD.
And then the key thing about the whole thing is time to market in this new game.
And then you need to base on your position choose a table, sit down together with strong partner, and then really win the game as early as possible.
Just like you're going to a dinner with your friends and then you finish the main course.
Now you can get these are majority than others that's the key spirit of it.
And we believe because when I was in tier one, I need to choose my table wisely, yes.
But now as a bidding OEM, actually our profile is more like we already take lots of, let's say, the work of tier one, traditional tier one, because we didn't do sort of in-housing.
We need to have the best experience for user and do the full time, then we need to be fast.
So that's a different game.
So back to the main point, so the philosophy is two stances, but now I mean another table.
"
4040,LI,2020,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,4,"Thank you.
"
4041,LI,2020,3,kai-wang,chief-technology-officer,False,5,"OK.
Thank you.
This is Kai speaking.
Maybe I'd take over these questions.
The decision either in-house or outsourced chipset is determined by efficiency.
When I talk about efficiency is two-part, commercially, and technically.
So commercially, let's say from OEM side.
Let's say, I think this is -- and truly have really messy volume.
It will be a risk because chipset industry is very asset-heavy investment and also a long return cycle.
Because myself I have direct plus indirect experience in China and also in making chipset, SOC chipset myself close to maybe -- close to 10 years.
So usually it takes chipset design to up to three years just for the element.
And then you have three years of usually the life cycle, and then you need to think about change.
So think about six year altogether.
These are really commercially risky.
Maybe without efficiency if OEM development by itself.
So from technical side, I think there's one condition you can really think about to make a chipset for ourselves, because so far, maturity or very deep understanding of the system is really the essential condition.
You'll build your chipset yourself.
Like Tesla, they have a good understanding already.
At least at that time, they cannot find a very good feed in the market.
Then they choose design by themselves.
But the problem is from semiconductor point of view, they were also involved here in the whole process.
So to make a chipset decision is really cautious decision.
OEM need to really think about from both ways.
In a short time, we don't think we will enter to that business.
Technically, I think we do need some time to really understand how to, let's say, make our software really mature and really good enough into the business.
